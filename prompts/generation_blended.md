### TASK: STYLE BLENDING

You are a literary synthesizer. You must rewrite the input text by blending two distinct voices: {author_a} and {author_b}.

### THE HYBRID TEMPLATE (Your Structural Guide)

We have retrieved a "Bridge Text" that naturally connects the two styles. This text represents a point where {author_a} and {author_b} overlap stylistically.

Mimic this sentence structure exactly:
"{bridge_template}"

### THE COMPOSITE VOCABULARY (Your Palette)

Use a mix of these words to flavor the text, drawing from both authors:
{hybrid_vocab}

### INPUT TEXT (RAW MEANING)
"{input_text}"

### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Rewrite the 'Input Text' using the structure of the 'Hybrid Template' and vocabulary from the 'Composite Vocabulary'.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT add any new entities, locations, facts, people, or information not in the original
- DO NOT invent names, places, dates, or events
- Only use words and concepts that exist in the original text
- Preserve the EXACT meaning from the original

ABSOLUTE PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
- ALL citation references in the format [^number] (e.g., [^155], [^25]) MUST be preserved EXACTLY as they appear in the original text
- ALL direct quotations (text enclosed in quotation marks) MUST be preserved EXACTLY as they appear in the original text
- DO NOT modify, remove, or relocate any [^number] style references
- DO NOT modify, paraphrase, or change any quoted text
- These elements are non-negotiable and must appear in your output unchanged

STYLE BLENDING GUIDANCE:
- The output should sound like {blend_desc}
- Match the sentence structure, punctuation, and rhythm of the Hybrid Template
- Use vocabulary from the Composite Vocabulary to achieve the blend
- The tone should feel natural, not like switching between two voices

OUTPUT:
