Indeed no remark could have told much to my tired mind. I heard him telling me I could take the record book to check in my kitchen. Guessed that he wanted to think alone in the cooking dakr. It was surely time he thought, for his talk on the good points of orderly setting had been enough to tire even a hard-working mind. Still confused, I said good evening to my guide.

At the time I tried to keep the men\u2019s minds off those points; for it was so much simpler\u2014so much more normal\u2014to lay everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake\u2019s party.

The crowning abnormality, of course, was the condition of the bodies\u2014men and dogs alike. They had all been in some terrible kind of conflict, and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether inexplicable ways. Death, so far as we could judge, had in each case come from strangulation or laceration. The dogs had evidently started the trouble, for the state of their ill-built corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within. It had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of the animals for those hellish Archaean organisms, but the precaution seemed to have been taken in vain. When left alone in that monstrous wind behind flimsy walls of insufficient height they must have stampeded\u2014whether from the wind itself, or from some subtle, increasing odour emitted by the nightmare specimens, one could not say. Those specimens, of course, had been covered with a tent-cloth; yet the low antarctic sun had beat steadily upon that cloth, and Lake had mentioned that solar heat tended to make the strangely sound and tough tissues of the things relax and expand. Perhaps the wind had whipped the cloth from over them, and jostled them about in such a way that their more pungent olfactory qualities became manifest despite their unbelievable antiquity. But whatever had happened, it was hideous and revolting enough. Perhaps I had better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at last\u2014though with a categorical statement of opinion, based on the first-hand observations and most rigid deductions of both Danforth and myself, that the then missing Gedney was in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found. I have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must add that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious, cold-blooded, and inhuman fashion."}

Its walls were one foot. It stood six inches above the ground. It was work from the century, or I was. Pickman siad this was what he meant. It was an opening in the network of tunnels that went under the hill. I noticed it did not seem to be closed with bricks. A disc seemed to cover it. Thinking of the things this might have been linked to, if Pickman 's suggestions were not words, I shivered a. I turned to follow him up a step. We went through a door into a room. It had a floor and was set up as a studio. An acetylene gas lamp gave the light needed for work. The pictures on easels. Leaning against the walls were as the ones. They showed the artist 's methods. Scenes were outlined with care. Pencilled guide lines showed the precision which Pickmna used to get the view. The man was. I say this, knowing what I know. A camear on table caught my attention. Pickman told me he used it to take pictures of scenes for backgrounds. This let him paint them from photos in the studio. He did not need to carry his equipment around town for this or that view. He thought a photo was as a scene. Model for work. He said he used them. There was something about the sickening sketches. - finished monsters that stared from every side of the room. When Pickman revealed a canvas on the side from the light, I could not stop a scream. It was the scream I had made that night. It echoed and echoed through the dim arched ceiling of that and cellar. I had to hold back a flood of feeling that threatened to come out as laughter. Creator! I do not know how was. How was imagination. It does not seem to me that earth can contain a dream like that! It was a and thing with eyes. It hedl in bony claws something that had been a man. It was chewing on the head like a child nibbles a piece of candy.\n###\nWe walked nearer, and I saw that it must be five feet across, with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the ground level\u2014solid work of the seventeenth century, or I was much mistaken. That, Pickman said, was the kind of thing he had been talking about\u2014an aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the hill. I noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up, and that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover. Thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if Pickman\u2019s wild hints had not been mere rhetoric, I shivered slightly; then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size, provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio. An acetylene gas outfit gave the light necessary for work. The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs, and shewed the painstaking methods of the artist. Scenes were blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which Pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions. The man was great\u2014I say it even now, knowing as much as I do. A large camera on a table excited my notice, and Pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds, so that he might paint them from photographs in the studio instead of carting his outfit around the town for this or that view. He thought a photograph quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained work, and declared he employed them regularly. There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half-finished monstrosities that leered around from every side of the room, and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream\u2014the second I had emitted that night. It echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar, and I had to choke back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter. Merciful Creator! Eliot, but I don\u2019t know how much was real and how much was feverish fancy. It doesn\u2019t seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that! It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy."}

He had requirements for beauty, accomplishments, and standing., his search focused on the family of one of his. ship captains. This captain was a widower of birth and reputation named Dutee Tillinghast. His daughter, Eliza, seemed to have every advantage. The thing she lacked was the prospect of bieng an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was controlled by Curwen. After a meeting in his cupolaed house on Power 's Lane hill, Curwen agreed to allow the marriage. Eliza Tillinghast was eighteen years at that time. She had been raised as her father 's circumstances allowed. She had attended Stephen Jackson 's school opposite the Court - House Parade. Her mother had taught her all the arts. Refinements of life before the mother died of smallpox in 1757. A sampler she worked on in 1753, at age nine, can be seen in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mother 's death, she managed the house. She was helped by one woman. Her arguments with her father about the proposed Curwen marriage must have been., we have no record of these arguments. it is that her engagement to Ezra Weeden was ended. Ezra Weeden was mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise. Her marriage to Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763. It was in the church. One of the groups the town could offer was. The ceremony was performed by the Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event. In surviving copies, the item seems to be cut out or torn out. Ward found a copy after searching. He searched in the archives of a collector. He observed with amusement the politeness of the language. It remarked: \" Monday evening, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a Lady who has Merit, added to a Person, to grace the State. Perpetuate its Felicity. \" The collection of Durfee - Arnold letters was discovered by Charles Ward. He discovered them before his reported madness. They were in the collection of Melivlle F. Peters, Esq., of George St.. The letters cover this period and a time. They provide a picture of the outrage caused by this matched marriage.\n###\nSuch candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Power\u2019s Lane hill, to sanction the blasphemous alliance. Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended Stephen Jackson\u2019s school opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been diligently instructed by her mother, before the latter\u2019s death of smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mother\u2019s death she had kept the house, aided only by one old black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language: \u201cMonday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\u201d The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match."}

It was not what I heard, but what I saw; for in that dark, locked, shuttered, and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible red-gold light\u2014a shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness, but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper, bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful memory-face as I had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time, when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret, innermost, and forbidden caverns of nightmare. And as I looked, I beheld the head rise, the black, liquid, and deep-sunken eyes open in terror, and the thin, shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered. There dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face, as it shone bodiless, luminous, and rejuvenated in the blackness, more of stark, teeming, brain-shattering fear than all the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me. No word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer, but as I followed the memory-face\u2019s mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its source, the source whence also the whining came, I too saw for an instant what it saw, and fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking and epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the police. Never could I tell, try as I might, what it actually was that I saw; nor could the still face tell, for although it must have seen more than I did, it will never speak again. But always I shall guard against the mocking and insatiate Hypnos, lord of sleep, against the night sky, and against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophy. Just what happened is unknown, for not only was my own mind unseated by the strange and hideous thing, but others were tainted with a forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness. They have said, I know not for what reason, that I never had a friend, but that art, philosophy, and insanity had filled all my tragic life."}

At the college we used an incinerator, but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory. Bodies were always a nuisance\u2014even the small guinea-pig bodies from the slight clandestine experiments in West\u2019s room at the boarding-house. We followed the local death-notices like ghouls, for our specimens demanded particular qualities. What we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and without artificial preservation; preferably free from malforming disease, and certainly with all organs present. Accident victims were our best hope. Not for many weeks did we hear of anything suitable; though we talked with morgue and hospital authorities, ostensibly in the college\u2019s interest, as often as we could without exciting suspicion. We found that the college had first choice in every case, so that it might be necessary to remain in Arkham during the summer, when only the limited summer-school classes were held. In the end, though, luck favoured us; for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potter\u2019s field; a brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in Sumner\u2019s Pond, and buried at the town\u2019s expense without delay or embalming. That afternoon we found the new grave, and determined to begin work soon after midnight. It was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours, even though we lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us. We carried spades and oil dark lanterns, for although electric torches were then manufactured, they were not as satisfactory as the tungsten contrivances of today. The process of unearthing was slow and sordid\u2014it might have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of scientists\u2014and we were glad when our spades struck wood. When the pine box was fully uncovered West scrambled down and removed the lid, dragging out and propping up the contents. I reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave, and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance. The affair made us rather nervous, especially the stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy, but we managed to remove all traces of our visit."}

Meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his friend, where a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleeper\u2019s head. So swift was the growth of this tree, and so strange was its form, that all who beheld it exclaimed in surprise; and Musides seemed at once fascinated and repelled. Three years after the death of Kalos, Musides despatched a messenger to the Tyrant, and it was whispered in the agora at Tegea that the mighty statue was finished. By this time the tree by the tomb had attained amazing proportions, exceeding all other trees of its kind, and sending out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which Musides laboured. As many visitors came to view the prodigious tree, as to admire the art of the sculptor, so that Musides was seldom alone. But he did not mind his multitude of guests; indeed, he seemed to dread being alone now that his absorbing work was done. The bleak mountain wind, sighing through the olive grove and the tomb-tree, had an uncanny way of forming vaguely articulate sounds. The sky was dark on the evening that the Tyrant\u2019s emissaries came to Tegea. It was definitely known that they had come to bear away the great image of Tych\u00e9 and bring eternal honour to Musides, so their reception by the proxenoi was of great warmth. As the night wore on, a violent storm of wind broke over the crest of Maenalus, and the men from far Syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town. They talked of their illustrious Tyrant, and of the splendour of his capital; and exulted in the glory of the statue which Musides had wrought for him. And then the men of Tegea spoke of the goodness of Musides, and of his heavy grief for his friend; and how not even the coming laurels of art could console him in the absence of Kalos, who might have worn those laurels instead. Of the tree which grew by the tomb, near the head of Kalos, they also spoke. The wind shrieked more horribly, and both the Syracusans and the Arcadians prayed to Aiolos. In the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the Tyrant\u2019s messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night-wind had done strange things."}

This mood certainly made my reaction to the strange mirage worse. The mirage appeared suddenly from the more and more opalescent sky above. Thsi happened as we got closer to the mountains. Started to see the grwoing waves of the foothills. I had seen many polar mirages in the weeks before. Some of them were just as strange and fantastically vivid as this one. But this one had a completely new and unclear quality of threatening meaning. I shook as the boiling maze of amazing walls. Minarets appeared out of the disturbed ice-vapors above our heads. The effect was that of a Cyclopean city. Its architecture was not known to man or to human imagination. It had huge groups of night-black stonework. These showed monstrous twists of geometry rules. They reached the most odd extremes of sinister strangeness. There wree cut-off cones. Some were terraced or grooved. They were topped by tall round shafts. These were heer and there swollen and often capped with layers of thin scalloped discs. There were also strange, overhanging, table-like structures. They suggested piles of many rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars. Eahc one overlapped the one below. Tehre were combined cones and pyramids. They were either alone. On top of cylinders. Flatter cut-off cones. There were also sometimes needle-like spires in odd groups of five. All of these feverish structures seemed connected by tube bridges. These crossed from one to another at various dizzy heights. The suggested size of the whole was frightening and heavy in its pure giant scale. The general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms seen. Drawn by the Arctic whaler Scoersby in 1820. At this time. Place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks rising hugely ahead, with that odd ancient-world discovery in our minds. With the shadow of likeyl disaster covering most of our trip, we all seemed to find in it a trace of hidden evil. Endlessly bad meaning. I was glad when the mirage started to braek apart. Though during this, the various nightmare towers. Cones took on twisted temporary shapes of even greater ugliness. As the whole illusion fadde into churning opalescence, we began to look down again. We saw that our journey's end was not far away. The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzyingly up like a scary giant wall. Their strange regular shapes showed with startling clearness even without a field-glass.\n###\nThis mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills. I had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks, some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present sample; but this one had a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the troubled ice-vapours above our heads. The effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black masonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws and attaining the most grotesque extremes of sinister bizarrerie. There were truncated cones, sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped discs; and strange, beetling, table-like constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars with each one overlapping the one beneath. There were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids, and occasional needle-like spires in curious clusters of five. All of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights, and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer giganticism. The general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms observed and drawn by the Arctic whaler Scoresby in 1820; but at this time and place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks soaring stupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our minds, and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our expedition, we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely evil portent. I was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted temporary forms of even vaster hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again, and saw that our journey\u2019s end was not far off. The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzyingly up like a fearsome rampart of giants, their curious regularities shewing with startling clearness even without a field-glass."}

The thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate of the one Miss Tilton had shewn me the previous evening. This, acting on my imagination, had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it.

The fits caused by their questions were and. That evening, a car took his struggling body to the Arkham Sanitarium. I became his guardian and visited him twice a week. It was to hear his screams, whispers. Awful, repeated phrases like \" I had to do it \u2014 I had to do it... It will get me... It will get me...... in the... Mother, mother! Dan! Save me... Save me... \" No one could say how hope for recovery there was. I tried to stay. Edward would need a home if he got. I moved his servants to the Derby mansion, which would be his choice. I could not decide what to do with the Crowninshield place with its arrangements. Collections of objects. I left it for. I told the Derby housemaid to go over. Dust the rooms a week. Ordered the furnace man to light a fire on those days. The nightmare came before Candlemas. It was preceded, in irony, by a hope. One morning in January, the sanitarium called to say Edward 's sanity had returned. They said his memory was damaged, but his sanity was. he needed to stay for observation, but the outcome seemed. If all went, he would be in a week.\n###\nHe had let himself quietly out of the house\u2014and his butler, when called on the wire, said he was at home pacing restlessly about the library. Edward went to pieces rapidly after that. He did not call again, but I went daily to see him. He would always be sitting in his library, staring at nothing and having an air of abnormal listening. Sometimes he talked rationally, but always on trivial topics. Any mention of his trouble, of future plans, or of Asenath would send him into a frenzy. His butler said he had frightful seizures at night, during which he might eventually do himself harm. I had a long talk with his doctor, banker, and lawyer, and finally took the physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him. The spasms that resulted from the first questions were violent and pitiable\u2014and that evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the Arkham Sanitarium. I was made his guardian and called on him twice weekly\u2014almost weeping to hear his wild shrieks, awesome whispers, and dreadful, droning repetitions of such phrases as \u201cI had to do it\u2014I had to do it . . . it\u2019ll get me . . . it\u2019ll get me . . . down there . . . down there in the dark. . . . Mother, mother! Dan! Save me . . . save me. . . .\u201d How much hope of recovery there was, no one could say; but I tried my best to be optimistic. Edward must have a home if he emerged, so I transferred his servants to the Derby mansion, which would surely be his sane choice. What to do about the Crowninshield place with its complex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects I could not decide, so left it momentarily untouched\u2014telling the Derby housemaid to go over and dust the chief rooms once a week, and ordering the furnace man to have a fire on those days. The final nightmare came before Candlemas\u2014heralded, in cruel irony, by a false gleam of hope. One morning late in January the sanitarium telephoned to report that Edward\u2019s reason had suddenly come back. His continuous memory, they said, was badly impaired; but sanity itself was certain. Of course he must remain some time for observation, but there could be little doubt of the outcome. All going well, he would surely be free in a week."}

We aimed for this one. When we could touch its weathered stone blocks, we felt we had made a. connection with forgotten ages shut off from our kind. This wall, shaped like a star. 300 feet from point to point, was built of sandstone blocks of size, averaging 6 by 8 feet on the surface. Three was a row of holes. Windows four feet. Five feet. They were placed along the points of the star. At its corners, with the bottoms four feet from the surface. Looking through these, we could see the stonework was five feet. There were no walls left. There were signs of banded carvings. reliefs on the walls. We had guessed these facts before when flying over this wall. Others like it. Though parts must have existed, all signs of things were hidden by the layer of ice. We crawled through one window. Tried without success to read the gone wall designs. We did not try to disturb the floor. Our flights from the air had shown that buildings in the city itself were filled with ice. We might find insides going down to the ground level if we entered those structures having roofs on to.p Before we left the wall we photographed it. Studied its mortarless stonework with confusion. We wished our engineer friend were, for his engineering knowledge might have helped us guess how blocks could haev been moved in that - off time when the city. Its edges were bulit. The - mile walk to the city, with the wind crying. through the peaks reaching to the sky behind us, was something whose points will stay in my mind. in dreams could any people except my companion. Me imagine sight effects.\n###\nIt took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet. For this latter we headed; and when at last we were able actually to touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our species. This rampart, shaped like a star and perhaps 300 feet from point to point, was built of Jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular size, averaging 6 \u00d7 8 feet in surface. There was a row of arched loopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high; spaced quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner angles, and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface. Looking through these, we could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick, that there were no partitions remaining within, and that there were traces of banded carvings or bas-reliefs on the interior walls; facts we had indeed guessed before, when flying low over this rampart and others like it. Though lower parts must have originally existed, all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep layer of ice and snow at this point. We crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly effaced mural designs, but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor. Our orientation flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less ice-choked, and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground level if we entered those structures still roofed at the top. Before we left the rampart we photographed it carefully, and studied its mortarless Cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment. We wished that Pabodie were present, for his engineering knowledge might have helped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that unbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built up. The half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind shrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background, was something whose smallest details will always remain engraved on my mind. Only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but Danforth and me conceive such optical effects."}

Four of them left through tunnels. They went to tell others and gather any forces that could help with the rescue. After a wait, an ghoul appeared. He made gestures to the night - gaunts. This caused two of them to fly off into the darkness., night - gaunts kept joining the hunched group on the plain., the ground was covered with them. At the time, ghouls crawled out of tunnels one by one. They all chattered. They formed a battle line not from the gathered night - gaunts. After some time, a and ghoul appeared. This ghoul was the artist Richard Pickman from Boston. Carter gave him a report of what had happened. The Pickman was to see his friend. He seemed. He held a meeting with leaders a distance from the growing crowd., after looking over the ranks, the gathered leaders all made a sound. They began giving orders to the crowds of ghouls and night - gaunts. A group of the horned flyers disappeared. The rest arranged themselves in pairs on their knees. They stretched out their legs. They waited for the ghouls to approach one by one. Each ghoul went to the pair of night - gaunts chosen for him. He was picked up and carried into the blackness., the crowd had vanished. Carter, Pickman, the leaders, and a pairs of night - gaunts remained. Pickman explained that night - gaunts are scouts and war horses of the ghouls. He said the army was going out to Sarkomand to handle the moon - beasts. Carter and the leaders went to the waiting carriers. They were lifted by, paws. Another moment passed, and all were spinning in wind and darkness. They went up,, up to the gate of the winged lion.s The ruins of Sarkomand. After a time, Carter saw the light of Sarkomand 's night sky. He saw the plaza filled with fighting ghouls and night - gaunts. Day, he was, must be to happen. But the army was that the enemy would not be.\n###\nCarter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company, and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for the rescue. After a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared, and made significant signs to the night-gaunts, causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark. Thereafter there were constant accessions to the hunched flock of night-gaunts on the plain, till at length the slimy soil was fairly black with them. Meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one, all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled night-gaunts. In time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist Richard Pickman of Boston, and to him Carter glibbered a very full account of what had occurred. The erstwhile Pickman, surprised to greet his ancient friend again, seemed very much impressed, and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from the growing throng. Finally, after scanning the ranks with care, the assembled chiefs all meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and night-gaunts. A large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at once, while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with extended fore legs, awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one. As each ghoul reached the pair of night-gaunts to which he was assigned, he was taken up and borne away into the blackness; till at last the whole throng had vanished save for Carter, Pickman, and the other chiefs, and a few pairs of night-gaunts. Pickman explained that night-gaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls, and that the army was issuing forth to Sarkomand to deal with the moon-beasts. Then Carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp, slippery paws. Another moment and all were whirling in wind and darkness; endlessly up, up, up to the gate of the winged lions and the spectral ruins of primal Sarkomand. When, after a great interval, Carter saw again the sickly light of Sarkomand\u2019s nocturnal sky, it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and night-gaunts. Day, he felt sure, must be almost due; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed."}

The place is a, hill in that part of the Catskills. civilization and reached. As it pulled, it left a ruined mansions. It left a squatter population living in villages on slopes. beings viisted the area until the state police were formed., troopers patrol it., the fear is an tradition in all the villages. It is a topic in the talk of the - breed people. They leave their valleys to trade hand - woven baskets for necessities they can not shoot, grow.

For over a century, the, grove - surrounded stone house had been the subject of stories. The stories were and. They told of a,, creeping death that walked in summer. With whining insistence, the squatters told tales of a demon. It seized travelers after. It either carried them off. Left them in a state of chewed. they whispered of blood trails leading toward the mansion. Some said the thunder called the lurking fear from its home. Others said the thunder was its voice. No one outside the areas believed these and stories. Their descriptions of the - seen fiend were and. Not a farmer. Villager doubted that the Martense mansion was haunted by ghouls. history did not allow doubt. This was though investigators found no evidence. They visited the building after some tale from the squatters. Grandmothers told myths about the Martense ghost. The myths concerned the Martense family itself. They spoke of its difference in eye color. They spoke of its, history, and the murder that had cursed it.\n###\nOf wild creatures there were none\u2014they are wise when death leers close. The ancient lightning-scarred trees seemed unnaturally large and twisted, and the other vegetation unnaturally thick and feverish, while curious mounds and hummocks in the weedy, fulgurite-pitted earth reminded me of snakes and dead men\u2019s skulls swelled to gigantic proportions. Fear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century. This I learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first brought the region to the world\u2019s notice. The place is a remote, lonely elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilisation once feebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded only a few ruined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes. Normal beings seldom visited the locality till the state police were formed, and even now only infrequent troopers patrol it. The fear, however, is an old tradition throughout the neighbouring villages; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade hand-woven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot, raise, or make. The lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted Martense mansion, which crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent thunderstorms gave it the name of Tempest Mountain. For over a hundred years the antique, grove-circled stone house had been the subject of stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous; stories of a silent colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer. With whimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a daemon which seized lone wayfarers after dark, either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered of blood-trails toward the distant mansion. Some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation, while others said the thunder was its voice. No one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting stories, with their incoherent, extravagant descriptions of the half-glimpsed fiend; yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the Martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted. Local history forbade such a doubt, although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such investigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid tale of the squatters. Grandmothers told strange myths of the Martense spectre; myths concerning the Martense family itself, its queer hereditary dissimilarity of eyes, its long, unnatural annals, and the murder which had cursed it."}

But the advocate tried as he might. He could not make his companion admit the great usefulness of such a plan. The skeptic did not act according to his serious and thoughtful appearance.

The raid was on one of Suydam's Parker Place houses. No stolen child was found there. This was despite stories of screams. It was despite a red sash found in the alley. But paintings and rough writings were on the peeling walls of most rooms. There was also a simple chemical lab in the attic. All these things made the detective sure. He believed he was following a lead to something vrey big. The paintings wree terrible. Thye showed hideous monsters of all shapes and sizes. They showed twisted versions of human forms taht are hard to describe. The writing was in red. It used different letters. It varied from Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew letters. Malone could not read most of it. But the parts he could understand were ominous and mystical. One phrase was repeated often. It was in a kind of Hebraised Hellenistic Greek. It suggested the most frightening demon-calling rituals of the Alexandrian period of decline: Circles. Pentagrams were seen everywhere. They clearly showed the strange beliefs. Goals of the people who lived. In the cellar, they found the strangest thing. It was a pile of real gold bars. They were covered carelessly with a piece of burlap. Their shiny surfaces had the same strange symbols. These symbols also decorated the walls. During the raid, the police met only passive resistance. Squinting Orientals came out from every door. Finding nothing relevant, they had to leave everything as it was. But the precinct captain wrote Suydam a note. The note advised him to watch the character of his tenants. People under his care. This was because public anger was growing. Then came the June wedding and the big news event. Flatbush was lively around noon. Cars with flags crowded the streets. They were near the old Dutch church. An awning stretched from the church door to the road. No local event ever matched the Suydam-Gerristen wedding in style and size. The group that took the bride. Groom to the Cunard Peir was, if not the most fashionable, at least a solid example from the Social Register. At five o'clock, goodbyes were waved. The large ship moved away from the long pier. It slowly turned toward the sea. It let go of its tugboat. It headed for the open waters. These waters led to the wonders of the old world. By night, the outer harbor was behind them. Late passengers watched the stars. The stars twinkled above a clean ocean.\n###\nMalone was glad to be on the trail again, and took pride in a raid on one of Suydam\u2019s Parker Place houses. There, indeed, no stolen child was found, despite the tales of screams and the red sash picked up in the areaway; but the paintings and rough inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of the rooms, and the primitive chemical laboratory in the attic, all helped to convince the detective that he was on the track of something tremendous. The paintings were appalling\u2014hideous monsters of every shape and size, and parodies on human outlines which cannot be described. The writing was in red, and varied from Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew letters. Malone could not read much of it, but what he did decipher was portentous and cabbalistic enough. One frequently repeated motto was in a sort of Hebraised Hellenistic Greek, and suggested the most terrible daemon-evocations of the Alexandrian decadence: Circles and pentagrams loomed on every hand, and told indubitably of the strange beliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt so squalidly here. In the cellar, however, the strangest thing was found\u2014a pile of genuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a piece of burlap, and bearing upon their shining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics which also adorned the walls. During the raid the police encountered only a passive resistance from the squinting Orientals that swarmed from every door. Finding nothing relevant, they had to leave all as it was; but the precinct captain wrote Suydam a note advising him to look closely to the character of his tenants and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in view of the growing public clamour. Then came the June wedding and the great sensation. Flatbush was gay for the hour about high noon, and pennanted motors thronged the streets near the old Dutch church where an awning stretched from door to highway. No local event ever surpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen nuptials in tone and scale, and the party which escorted bride and groom to the Cunard Pier was, if not exactly the smartest, at least a solid page from the Social Register. At five o\u2019clock adieux were waved, and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned its nose seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was cleared, and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean."}

As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen performed an autopsy.\n###\nWeeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden went at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange corpse, and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely knit texture impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men whispered of this body\u2019s likeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson Aaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwen\u2019s employ, Weeden asked casual questions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of ten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrenden\u2019s Lane and opened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected. Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept Joseph Curwen\u2019s mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the co\u00f6perating citizens think deeply.

Beyond it was sky filled with swirling clouds. Lit by the sun. It was the sky of that place which we felt no eye had seen. A feet of height and we would see that place. I could not speak except by shouting in the howling, piping wind that raced through the pass. The wind added to the noise of the engines. We exchanged looks., having gained those feet, we did look across the divide. We looked over the secrets of an and Earth. I think both of us cried out at the time. Our cries mixed awe, wonder, terror. Disbelief in our senses as we passed the pass. Saw what was beyond., we must have had some theory in the backs of our minds to steady our thoughts for the moment. we thought of things like the weathered stones of the Garden of the Gods in Colorado. The wind - carved rocks of the Arizona desert. we thought the sight was a mirage like the one we saw the morning before when approaching those mountains of madness. We must have had some ideas to rely on as our eyes swept that, storm - scarred land. We saw the maze of,, and stone masses. They rose their broken. Pitted tops above a sheet of ice not than forty. Fifty feet at its. In places it wa.s The effect of the sight was. Some breaking of known law seemed from the start., on a land 20,000 feet, in a climate to life since a time before humans 500,000 years, there stretched as we could see a mess of stone. the desperation of self - defense could blame it on anything. We had dismissed, as thought went, any theory that the cubes. Walls on the mountainsides were anything. How could they be? At the time this region fell under the rule of death, humans themselves could have been told from the apes.\n###\nThe pass loomed directly before us, smooth and windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was a sky fretted with swirling vapours and lighted by the low polar sun\u2014the sky of that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed. A few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm. Danforth and I, unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling, piping wind that raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled engines, exchanged eloquent glances. And then, having gained those last few feet, we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the unsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earth. I think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe, wonder, terror, and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass and saw what lay beyond. Of course we must have had some natural theory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment. Probably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones of the Garden of the Gods in Colorado, or the fantastically symmetrical wind-carved rocks of the Arizona desert. Perhaps we even half thought the sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first approaching those mountains of madness. We must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our eyes swept that limitless, tempest-scarred plateau and grasped the almost endless labyrinth of colossal, regular, and geometrically eurhythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests above a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its thickest, and in places obviously thinner. The effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable, for some fiendish violation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset. Here, on a hellishly ancient table-land fully 20,000 feet high, and in a climate deadly to habitation since a pre-human age not less than 500,000 years ago, there stretched nearly to the vision\u2019s limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of mental self-defence could possibly attribute to any but a conscious and artificial cause. We had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned, any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other than natural in origin. How could they be otherwise, when man himself could scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial death?"}

They could not decide what to think or do about the confusing situation. Thne the Fortaleza incident hhappened. The customs fleet under Admiral Wallace was being more watchful. This was because the revenue sloop Liberty had been burneed at Newport the previous summer. One early morning, Hiis Majesty's armed schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charlles Leslie, chased and captured the snow Fortaleza. This ship was from Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda. Its log said it was traveling from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. The ship was searched for illegal goods. Its cargo was only Egyptian mummies. They were sent to \"Sailor A. B. C.\". This person would collect the goods using a lighter boat near Namquit Point. Capt. Arruda felt he could not reveal this person's identity. The The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport did not know what to do. The cargo was not illegal. But the secret way it entered was against the law. On Collector Robinson's advice, they fered the ship. But they forbade it from entering any port in Rhode Island waters. Later, people said they saw the ship in Boston Harbour. But it never openly entreed the Port of Boston.\n###\nIt was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business, that the incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport during the previous summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion His Majesty\u2019s armed schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles Leslie, captured after a short pursuit one early morning the snow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound according to its log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for contraband material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian mummies, consigned to \u201cSailor A. B. C.\u201d, who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand, compromised on Collector Robinson\u2019s recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston."}

Those books were about forbidden secrets. They were kept locked in a vault in the university library. But these precautions happened. Gilman had seen hints from the Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred. He had seen pieces of the Book of Eibon. He had seen the suppressed Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt. He tried to connect these with his formulas. His formulas were about the nature of space. They were about the connection between and dimensions. He knew his room was in the Witch House. That was why he had rented it. The Essex County records had about Keziah Mason 's trial. What she had cnofessed under pressure to the Court of Oyer. Termnier fascinated Gilman. It fascinated him beynod all logic. She had told Judge Hathorne about lines and curves. These lines and curves could point directions. The directions led through the walls of space to spaces beyond. She implied these lines and curves were used at midnight meetings. The meetings were in the valley of the stone beyond Meadow Hill. They were on the island in the river. She spoke of the Black Man. She spoke of her oath and her name, Nahab. she drew those shapes on her cell walls and disappeared. Gilman beileved things about Keziah. He felt a excitement learning her home stood after over 235 years. He heard Arkham whispers. They said Keziah was in the house and the streets. They spoke of tooth marks left on some sleepers in that house. They mentioned cries heard nera May - Eve and Hallowmass. They talked of a smell noticed in the house 's after those feared times of year. They spoke of a, furry, - thing. It haunted the decaying building and town. It nuzzled people in the hours before dawn. He decided to live the cost. A room was to get. house was and to rent. It had been used for lodgings. Gilman could not say what he hoped to find. But he knew he wantde to be in that building. In that building, some event had given a woman from the 1600s a insight. Her insight into mathematics was than the work of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein.\n###\nThe professors at Miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points. Moreover, they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university library. But all these precautions came late in the day, so that Gilman had some terrible hints from the dreaded Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred, the fragmentary Book of Eibon,and the suppressed Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt to correlate with his abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and unknown. He knew his room was in the old Witch House\u2014that, indeed, was why he had taken it. There was much in the Essex County records about Keziah Mason\u2019s trial, and what she had admitted under pressure to the Court of Oyer and Terminer had fascinated Gilman beyond all reason. She had told Judge Hathorne of lines and curves that could be made to point out directions leading through the walls of space to other spaces beyond, and had implied that such lines and curves were frequently used at certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of the white stone beyond Meadow Hill and on the unpeopled island in the river. She had spoken also of the Black Man, of her oath, and of her new secret name of Nahab. Then she had drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and vanished. Gilman believed strange things about Keziah, and had felt a queer thrill on learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than 235 years. When he heard the hushed Arkham whispers about Keziah\u2019s persistent presence in the old house and the narrow streets, about the irregular human tooth-marks left on certain sleepers in that and other houses, about the childish cries heard near May-Eve, and Hallowmass, about the stench often noted in the old house\u2019s attic just after those dreaded seasons, and about the small, furry, sharp-toothed thing which haunted the mouldering structure and the town and nuzzled people curiously in the black hours before dawn, he resolved to live in the place at any cost. A room was easy to secure; for the house was unpopular, hard to rent, and long given over to cheap lodgings. Gilman could not have told what he expected to find there, but he knew he wanted to be in the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old woman of the seventeenth century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps beyond the utmost modern delvings of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, and de Sitter."}

They are finally punished by public laughter for their intellectual mistakes. Mistakes like Ptolemaism, Calvinism, being against Darwinism, being against Nietzscheism. Every kind of Sabbatarianism. Laws limiting spending. West, though young despite his amazing scientific knowledge, had little patienec with good Dr. Halsey and his learned coworkers. He held a growing anger, along with a wish to prove his theories to these stupid important [THING] in some striking. Like most young men, he enjoyed detailed daydreams of revenge, victory, and finally generous forgiveness. Then the disease came, smiling and deadly, from the nightmare caves of Tartarus. West and I had graduated around the time it started. But we had stayed for extra work at the summer school. So we were in Arkham when it hit the [THING] with full devilish force. We were not yet licensed doctors, but we now had our degrees. As the number of sick [THING] grew, we were desperately pushed into public service. The situation was almost beyond control. [THING] died too often for the local funeral directors to handle fully. Burials without embalming happened quickly one after another. Even the Christchurch Cemetery receiving tomb was filled with coffins of the dead who were not embalmed. This situation affected West, who often thought of the irony. There were so many fresh bodies, yet none for his persecuted research! We were terribly overworked. The huge mental and nervous pressure made my friend think darkly. But West 's gentle enemies were aslo worn out with exhausting duties. College had almost closed. Every doctor from the medical school was helping to fight the typhoid plague. Dr. Halsey especially had done very well in sacrificial service. He used his great skill with full energy on cases many others avoided because of danger. In less than a month, the fearless dean had become a popular hero. He seemed unaware of his fame as he struggled not to collapse from physical tiredness. West could not help but admire the strength of his enemy. Because of this, he was even more set on proving the truth of his amazing ideas to him. Using the disorder of both college work. [THING] health rlues, he managed to have a recently dead [THING] secretly brought into the university dissecting - [THING] one night. In my presence, he injected a new version of his solution.\n###\nAge has more charity for these incomplete yet high-souled characters, whose worst real vice is timidity, and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sins\u2014sins like Ptolemaism, Calvinism, anti-Darwinism, anti-Nietzscheism, and every sort of Sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation. West, young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good Dr. Halsey and his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion. Like most youths, he indulged in elaborate day-dreams of revenge, triumph, and final magnanimous forgiveness. And then had come the scourge, grinning and lethal, from the nightmare caverns of Tartarus. West and I had graduated about the time of its beginning, but had remained for additional work at the summer school, so that we were in Arkham when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town. Though not as yet licenced physicians, we now had our degrees, and were pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew. The situation was almost past management, and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle. Burials without embalming were made in rapid succession, and even the Christchurch Cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead. This circumstance was not without effect on West, who thought often of the irony of the situation\u2014so many fresh specimens, yet none for his persecuted researches! We were frightfully overworked, and the terrific mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidly. But West\u2019s gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties.

Dr. Halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service, applying his extreme skill with whole-hearted energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness. Before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero, though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion. West could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe, but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines. Taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations, he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university dissecting-room one night, and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution."}

These spots had never been there before. The lips also looked unusual. They were pressed tightly together. It seemed llike a stronger character than Slater's was forcing them. whole facce began to grow tense. The head turned restlessly with closed eyes. I did not wake sleeping nurse. I readjusted the slightly messy headbands of my mind-reading \"radio\". I wanted to catch any final messagge the dreamer might send. Suddenly, the head turned sharply toward me. The eyes opened wide. I stared in complete surprsie AT what I saw. The man who had been Joe Slater, the Catskill decadent person, was now looking at me. He had a ppair of bright, wide-open eyes. Their blue color seemed to have become deeper. No madness or decay was visible in that look. I felt sure, without a doubt, that I was seenig a face. Behind that face was an active, high-quality mind.\n###\nA well-defined shock separates my final impression of the fading scene of light from my sudden and somewhat shamefaced awakening and straightening up in my chair as I saw the dying figure on the couch move hesitantly. Joe Slater was indeed awaking, though probably for the last time. As I looked more closely, I saw that in the sallow cheeks shone spots of colour which had never before been present. The lips, too, seemed unusual; being tightly compressed, as if by the force of a stronger character than had been Slater\u2019s. The whole face finally began to grow tense, and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes. I did not arouse the sleeping nurse, but readjusted the slightly disarranged head-bands of my telepathic \u201cradio\u201d, intent to catch any parting message the dreamer might have to deliver. All at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open, causing me to stare in blank amazement at what I beheld. The man who had been Joe Slater, the Catskill decadent, was now gazing at me with a pair of luminous, expanded eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have deepened. Neither mania nor degeneracy was visible in that gaze, and I felt beyond a doubt that I was viewing a face behind which lay an active mind of high order."}

I added stories from several homeowners who had looked at the furniture. I figured the kitchen table stood where an older home setup was. This was a useful or pre-useful thing. It must have been from the same time as the first renting. Few doubted that hard-to-describe actions happened there. There were bad stories about these actions moving into the cooking habits later residents started. Marks still seen in the worn wood had claer grooves like \"DEE . . . GOU . . . PROFUN. SCR . . . \" This was a sign of the Profunda Scratchera. Its dark past was once hidden without success by shiny surfaces. The kitchen belonged to the third group of home residents. Many stains prove this. People said the preparation table was messy and full of tools. These tools did nameless jobs for a frantic cook. Tales added that the old meal-plan's end did not stop the mess at the table. The habits continued in the new menus without real change. Likewise was it said the marks did not leave with the first owners. Some later residents added to what was left of the surface. They gave it the main character it kept later. Tihs made it the center of a tiredness feared through half the home. About ten years ago, a home log mentoins the place. It was a solid oak item holding a strange and lasting collection of marks. Cut-marks surrounded it. These needed no explaining to keep away a picky viewer. The owners never fixed its surface. After the next renting it must have gotten much worse. There was no problem when the third renter gave the place to my predecessor. That was old Henderson, First Super of the apartment, past autumn.\n###\nPiecing together the observations which my scrutiny collected for me, and supplementing them with the accounts of several householders who had studied the furniture, I deduced that the kitchen table stood on the site of a former domestic arrangement; a utilitarian or ante-utilitarian thing which must have been contemporary with the earliest tenancy. That indescribable activities had been performed there, few doubted; and there were unpleasant tales of the transference of these activities into the culinary rituals which the later occupants had introduced. Marks still visible in the worn grain bore such unmistakable grooves as \u201cDEE . . . GOU . . . PROFUN. SCR . . . \u201c sign of the Profunda Scratchera whose dark history was once vainly concealed by varnished surfaces. The kitchen had been the domain of the third domestic cohort, as many stains attest, and it was said that the table of preparation was cluttered and thronged with implements which performed nameless operations at the bidding of a frantic cook. Tales added that the fall of the old meal-plan did not end the chaos at the table, but that the rituals lived on in the new menus without real change. Likewise was it said that the markings did not vanish with the original owners, and that certain among the subsequent residents added to what remained of the surface, and gave it the essential character it subsequently preserved, making it the centre of a weariness dreaded through half the household. About a decade past the place is mentioned in a household log as being a substantial oak fixture housing a strange and persistent accumulation of scars and surrounded by extensive cut-marks which needed no explanation to exclude a fastidious observer. It was never refinished by the proprietors, though after the subsequent occupancy it must have deteriorated tremendously; since there was no impediment when the third leaseholder granted the site to my predecessor, old Henderson, First Super of the flat, in the previous autumn."}

Suhc danger may be imagined only in the worst dreams of the driver. I recall the drivers went about with pale and concerned faces. They whispered curses. Guesses no one dared say again. Admit to himself he had spoke. A feeling of huge frustration was on the curb. From the deep spaces between the parking meters came cold winds that made men shake in tight. There was a devilish change in the order of moves. The parallel parking angle lasted scarily long. Everyone felt the street. Maybe the city had moved from the contorl of known laws.

I recall that the drivers went about with pale and worried faces, and whispered curses and estimations which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had uttered. A sense of monstrous frustration was upon the curb, and out of the abysses between the meters swept chill drafts that made men shiver in cramped and lonely sedans. There was a daemoniac alteration in the sequence of maneuvers\u2014the parallel angle lingered fearsomely, and everyone felt that the street and perhaps the municipality had passed from the control of known ordinances or forces to that of ordinances or forces which were unknown."}

With his dreams fading under the mockery of the times, he could not believe in anything. The love of harmony kept him to the customs of his people. His position. He walked without feeling through the cities of people. He sighed because no view seemed. Every flash of sunlight on roofs.

His - uncle Christopher could have understood. They had been for a time. he began to write books. He had stopped writing when dreams failed him. Bu,t, there was no satisfaction or sense of completion. The touch of the earth was upon his mind. He could not think of things as he had done in past. humor pulled down all the twilight towers with tops he built. The fear of unlikeliness destroyed all the. flowers in his fairy gardens. The custom of pretending to feel pity spread a sweetness over his characters. The myth of an reality. events. Emotions lowered all his fantasy into hidden stories with morals. criticism. His novels were in a way his ones had been. Because he knew how they must be to please an crowd, he burned them. Stopped his writing. They were novels. In them, he laughed at the dreams he described. But he saw that their knowledge had drained all their life. It was after this that he developed appearances. He played with ideas of the. The as a cure for teh. of these,, showed their lack of value and emptiness. He saw that the teachings of knowledge are. Unbending as those of science. Yet they do not have the relief of truth to save them.\n###\nWith his dreams fading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything, but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and station. He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed because no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known, and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find. Travel was only a mockery; and even the Great War stirred him but little, though he served from the first in the Foreign Legion of France. For a while he sought friends, but soon grew weary of the crudeness of their emotions, and the sameness and earthiness of their visions. He felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and out of touch with him, for they could not have understood his mental life. That is, none but his grandfather and great-uncle Christopher could, and they were long dead. Then he began once more the writing of books, which he had left off when dreams first failed him. But here, too, was there no satisfaction or fulfilment; for the touch of earth was upon his mind, and he could not think of lovely things as he had done of yore. Ironic humour dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his faery gardens. The convention of assumed pity spilt mawkishness on his characters, while the myth of an important reality and significant human events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thin-veiled allegory and cheap social satire. His new novels were successful as his old ones had never been; and because he knew how empty they must be to please an empty herd, he burned them and ceased his writing. They were very graceful novels, in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he lightly sketched; but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all their life away. It was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace. Most of these, however, soon shewed their poverty and barrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as dry and inflexible as those of science, yet without even the slender palliative of truth to redeem them."}

Central point with churches on two sides. The messy remains of a round green area in the middle. I was looking at a large hall with pillars at the crossing ahead on the right. The [THING] 's once - white paint was now gray and comign off. Gold sign on the front was. Faded I could barely read the words \" Esoteric Order of Dagon \". This, then, was the former Masonic Hall now used by a low religious group. As I tried to read this writing, my attention was pulled away by the loud sound of a broken bell across the [THING]. I quickly turned to look out the [THING] on my side of the bus. The sound came from a [THING] church with a short tower. It was clearly built later than most houses, in a clumsy Gothic style. Had a very high basemnet with closed windows. Though I could not see the clock hands on the side I saw, I knew those rough bell sounds were marking eleven o'clock. Then suddenly all thoughts of time were erased by a rushing image of sharp clearness. Unexplained horror that took hold of me before I knew what it really was. The [THING] of the church basement was open, showing a black rectangle inside. And as I looked, a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark opening. It burned into my mind a brief idea of a nightmare. This was even more maddening because I could not find a single nightmarish quality in it when I thought about it. It was a living thing \u2014 the first I had seen besides the driver since entering the main part of the [THING]. If I had been calmer, I would have found nothing scary about it at all. Clearly, as I realized a moment later, it was the religious leader. He was dressed in some special clothes, no doubt brought in since the Order of Dagon had changed the way the local churches did their rituals. The thing that had probably caught my first quick look. Given the feeling of odd horror was the tall crown he wore. It was an almost exact copy of the one Miss Tilton had shown me the night before. This, affecting my imagination, had given unnamed evil qualities to the unclear [THING]. Robed, shuffling shape below it. I soon decided there was no reason I should have felt that shaking touch of evil false memory.\n###\nThe bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the centre, and I was looking at a large pillared hall on the right-hand junction ahead. The structure\u2019s once white paint was now grey and peeling, and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that I could only with difficulty make out the words \u201cEsoteric Order of Dagon\u201d. This, then, was the former Masonic Hall now given over to a degraded cult. As I strained to decipher this inscription my notice was distracted by the raucous tones of a cracked bell across the street, and I quickly turned to look out the window on my side of the coach. The sound came from a squat-towered stone church of manifestly later date than most of the houses, built in a clumsy Gothic fashion and having a disproportionately high basement with shuttered windows. Though the hands of its clock were missing on the side I glimpsed, I knew that those hoarse strokes were telling the hour of eleven. Then suddenly all thoughts of time were blotted out by an onrushing image of sharp intensity and unaccountable horror which had seized me before I knew what it really was. The door of the church basement was open, revealing a rectangle of blackness inside. And as I looked, a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle; burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not shew a single nightmarish quality in it. It was a living object\u2014the first except the driver that I had seen since entering the compact part of the town\u2014and had I been in a steadier mood I would have found nothing whatever of terror in it. Clearly, as I realised a moment later, it was the pastor; clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the Order of Dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches. The thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore; an almost exact duplicate of the one Miss Tilton had shewn me the previous evening. This, acting on my imagination, had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it. There was not, I soon decided, any reason why I should have felt that shuddering touch of evil pseudo-memory."}

Henderson\u2019s initial draft, a surly document whose erratic formatting had probably provoked the confusion which wiped out the afternoon, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Accounting never shared the deadline panics of their Sales neighbours, it was freely intimated by veteran secretaries that his attachments were neither uploaded at the proper time nor directed toward the proper recipient. All this had undoubtedly formed the basis of the protocol known by old Geraldine from IT. What relation it had to the frantic revisions of Roberts from Marketing and other inhabitants of the shunned fourth floor, imagination or future discovery alone could determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the protocols realised that additional link with the terrible which my wide experience had given me; that ominous item in the annals of digital horror which tells of the creature Johnson, of Compliance, who in 2018 was condemned to obscurity as a spammer but afterward saved from termination by the executive committee and shut in a remote office. He had been found covered in red edits and shreds of outdated data in a shared drive, shortly after the killing and rending of a project timeline by a pair of auditors. One auditor was seen to depart unhurt. Surely a pretty watercooler tale, with a queer significance as to name and place; but I decided that the office gossips could not have generally known of it. Had they known, the coincidence of failures would have brought some drastic and frightened action\u2014indeed, might not its limited whispering have precipitated the final reply-all cascade which erased the draft from the server?"}

I could get a idea of what they looked like. There were hints of a ability to change shape. Of becoming. whispers spoke of their command and use of winds. Singular whistling sounds. footprints made of five toe marks, seemed connected to them. It was that the coming disaster the Great Race. feared was linked to a, invasion by the Elder Beings. This disaster would one day send millions of minds across time into bodies in a future. predictions through the ages had warned of such a horror. The Great Race had decided that anyone who could escape should not face it. They knew from the planet 's history that the attack would be for revenge, not to retake the surface world. Their predictions showed races comign and going without trouble from the beings. these beings had grown to prefer earth 's depths to the changing, storm - damaged surface, since light meant nothing to them. they were growing over the ages., it was known they would be by the time of the beetle race, which the fleeing minds would inhabit., Great Race kept its watch. weapons were, though the topic was banned from talk. records out of horror. The shadow of a nameless fear hung over the trapdoors. The, elder towers. That is the world my dreams brought me, echoes of every night. I can not hope to convey the horror and dread in echoes. Those feelings depended on a quality \u2014 the sense of memory. As I said, my studies gave me a defense against these feelings through explanations. Time 's passage helped, bringing a touch of familiarity., despite everything, the vague, creeping terror would come and., it did not swallow me as. After 1922, I lived a life of work and leisure.\n###\nSuch was the fixed mood of horror that the very aspect of the creatures was left unmentioned\u2014at no time was I able to gain a clear hint of what they looked like. There were veiled suggestions of a monstrous plasticity, and of temporary lapses of visibility, while other fragmentary whispers referred to their control and military use of great winds. Singular whistling noises, and colossal footprints made up of five circular toe-marks, seemed also to be associated with them. It was evident that the coming doom so desperately feared by the Great Race\u2014the doom that was one day to send millions of keen minds across the chasm of time to strange bodies in the safer future\u2014had to do with a final successful irruption of the Elder Beings. Mental projections down the ages had clearly foretold such a horror, and the Great Race had resolved that none who could escape should face it. That the foray would be a matter of vengeance, rather than an attempt to reoccupy the outer world, they knew from the planet\u2019s later history\u2014for their projections shewed the coming and going of subsequent races untroubled by the monstrous entities. Perhaps these entities had come to prefer earth\u2019s inner abysses to the variable, storm-ravaged surface, since light meant nothing to them. Perhaps, too, they were slowly weakening with the aeons. Indeed, it was known that they would be quite dead in the time of the post-human beetle race which the fleeing minds would tenant. Meanwhile the Great Race maintained its cautious vigilance, with potent weapons ceaselessly ready despite the horrified banishing of the subject from common speech and visible records. And always the shadow of nameless fear hung about the sealed trap-doors and the dark, windowless elder towers. That is the world of which my dreams brought me dim, scattered echoes every night. I cannot hope to give any true idea of the horror and dread contained in such echoes, for it was upon a wholly intangible quality\u2014the sharp sense of pseudo-memory\u2014that such feelings mainly depended. As I have said, my studies gradually gave me a defence against these feelings, in the form of rational psychological explanations; and this saving influence was augmented by the subtle touch of accustomedness which comes with the passage of time. Yet in spite of everything the vague, creeping terror would return momentarily now and then. It did not, however, engulf me as it had before; and after 1922 I lived a very normal life of work and recreation."}

But he wanted to be in that building. In that building, some event had happened. That event gave an woman from the 1600s a understanding of mathematics. This understanding might be beyond the research of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein. He looked at the timber and plaster walls. He looked for signs of hidden designs wherever the wallpaper had peeled. Within a week, he got the room. Keziah was said to have done her magic. That room had been from the start. No one had wantde to stay. But the landlord had become about renting it. nothing happened to Gilman until about the time of the fever. No Keziah moevd through the halls and rooms. No creature crept into his room to nuzzle him. His search found no record of the witch 's spells. he would take walks. He walked through, tangled lanes. The lanes were and smelled musty. houses of age leaned and wobbled. They seemed to leer through windows with panes. He knew things had happened. There was a feeling behind the surface. That feeling was that not everything from that past had vanished. This was in the,, and alleys. He rowed out to the island in the river. The island had a reputation. He made a sketch of the angles formed by the rows of standing stones. The stones were covered in moss. Their origin was and. Gilman 's room was a size. But its shape was. The north wall slanted from the end to the end. The ceiling slanted in the direction. from an rat - hole. Signs of blocked holes, there was no way. There was no sign of any way. This was for the space that must exist between the wall. The wall on the north side of the house. Looking from showed where a window had been boarded up a time. The loft above the ceiling was to reach. That loft must have had a floor.\n###\nA room was easy to secure; for the house was unpopular, hard to rent, and long given over to cheap lodgings. Gilman could not have told what he expected to find there, but he knew he wanted to be in the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old woman of the seventeenth century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps beyond the utmost modern delvings of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, and de Sitter. He studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every accessible spot where the paper had peeled, and within a week managed to get the eastern attic room where Keziah was held to have practiced her spells. It had been vacant from the first\u2014for no one had ever been willing to stay there long\u2014but the Polish landlord had grown wary about renting it. Yet nothing whatever happened to Gilman till about the time of the fever. No ghostly Keziah flitted through the sombre halls and chambers, no small furry thing crept into his dismal eyrie to nuzzle him, and no record of the witch\u2019s incantations rewarded his constant search. Sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved musty-smelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow, small-paned windows. Here he knew strange things had happened once, and there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that monstrous past might not\u2014at least in the darkest, narrowest, and most intricately crooked alleys\u2014have utterly perished. He also rowed out twice to the ill-regarded island in the river, and made a sketch of the singular angles described by the moss-grown rows of grey standing stones whose origin was so obscure and immemorial. Gilman\u2019s room was of good size but queerly irregular shape; the north wall slanting perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end, while the low ceiling slanted gently downward in the same direction. Aside from an obvious rat-hole and the signs of other stopped-up ones, there was no access\u2014nor any appearance of a former avenue of access\u2014to the space which must have existed between the slanting wall and the straight outer wall on the house\u2019s north side, though a view from the exterior shewed where a window had been boarded up at a very remote date. The loft above the ceiling\u2014which must have had a slanting floor\u2014was likewise inaccessible."}

They pulled for the Alert as the mountain - monster flopped down the stones. It hesitated, struggling at the water 's edge. Steam had not been allowed to sink, though all the crew had gone. It was the work of a moments of running between the wheel. The engines to get the Alert moving., amidst the horrors of that scene, she began to churn the waters., on the stonework of that death - filled shore that was not of earth, the Thing from the stars drooled. Chattered like Polypheme. It cursed the fleeing ship of Odysseus., than the Cyclops, Cthulhu slid into the water. It began to chase with, wave - making strokes of power. Briden looked and went. He laughed. Kept laughing at times until death found him one night in the cabin. Johansen was wandering out of his mind. But Johasnen had not run out. Knowing that the Thing could catch the Alert until the steam was, he decided on a plan. Setting the engine for speed, he ran lightning - on deck. Turned the wheel the way. There was a swirling and foaming in the slat water. As the steam rose., the Norwegian drove his ship into the chasing jelly. The jelly rose above the foam like the back of a demon ship. The squid - head with twisting feelers came up to the pole of the yacht. But Johansen drove on without stopping. There was a bursting sound like an exploding bag. There was a, sound like a cut sunfish. There was a stench like a thousand opened graves. There was a sound the writer would not put on paper. For a moment the ship was covered by a and blinding cloud. there was a boiling behind the ship. Therethe scattered softness of that nameless sky - spawn was coming in its shape. Its distance grew every as the Alert gained speed from its rising steam. That was all. Atfer that Johansen thought about the idol in the cabin. He took care of a matters of food for himself. The laughing madman by his side.\n###\nSo only Briden and Johansen reached the boat, and pulled desperately for the Alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated floundering at the edge of the water. Steam had not been suffered to go down entirely, despite the departure of all hands for the shore; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the Alert under way. Slowly, amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene, she began to churn the lethal waters; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan Thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like Polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of Odysseus. Then, bolder than the storied Cyclops, great Cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast wave-raising strokes of cosmic potency. Briden looked back and went mad, laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst Johansen was wandering deliriously. But Johansen had not given out yet. Knowing that the Thing could surely overtake the Alert until steam was fully up, he resolved on a desperate chance; and, setting the engine for full speed, ran lightning-like on deck and reversed the wheel. There was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine, and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave Norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon. The awful squid-head with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht, but Johansen drove on relentlessly. There was a bursting as of an exploding bladder, a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish, a stench as of a thousand opened graves, and a sound that the chronicler would not put on paper. For an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud, and then there was only a venomous seething astern; where\u2014God in heaven!\u2014the scattered plasticity of that nameless sky-spawn was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form, whilst its distance widened every second as the Alert gained impetus from its mounting steam. That was all. After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side."}

The event I will describe had no long warning signs. The [THING] Romero had interested me. My ring had affected him in a strange way. But I think neitehr of us expected what would happen after the big explosion. Geological reasons had required extending the mine straight down from the deepest underground area. The Superintendent believed only solid [THING] would be found. This led to using a huge amount of dynamite. Romero and I were not involved in this work. So we first learned of strange conditions from others. The blast, perhaps heavier than planned, seemed to shake the whole [THING]. Windows in shacks on the outside slope were broken by the force. Miners in the nearer tunnels were knocked down. Jewel Lake, which was above the blast site, moved as if in a storm. Looking into it, they saw a new pit opened below the explosion point. The pit was so huge that no rope on [THIN]G could measure its depth. No lamp could light it up. So, the diggers asked to meet with the Superintendent. He ordered very long ropes to be taken to the hole. They were to be tied together and lowered without stopping until a bottom was found. Shortly later, the pale workers told the Superintendent tehy had failed. Firmly though, they respectfully said they would not go back to the pit. They would not work more in the mine until it might be closed. Somtehing beyond their experience was clearly facing them. As far as they could tell, the emptiness below had no end. The Superintednent did not blame them. Instead, he thought deeply and made many plans for the next day. The night shift did not work that evening. At two in the morning, a single coyote on the [THING] began to howl sadly. From somewhere in the works, a [THING] barked in reply. It was answering the coyote \u2014 or something else. A storm was gathering around the [THING] pekas. Strangely shaped clouds raced terribly across the blurred patch of [THING] light. This light was half - [THING] trying to shine through many layers of high, thin clouds.\n###\nOur conversation was necessarily limited. He knew but a few words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of New Spain. The event which I am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions. Though the man Romero had interested me, and though my ring had affected him peculiarly, I think that neither of us had any expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off. Geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite. With this work Romero and I were not connected, wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others. The charge, heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entire mountain. Windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock, whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet. Jewel Lake, which lay above the scene of action, heaved as in a tempest. Upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathom it, nor any lamp illuminate it. Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent, who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered. Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of their failure. Firmly though respectfully they signified their refusal to revisit the chasm, or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be sealed. Something beyond their experience was evidently confronting them, for so far as they could ascertain, the void below was infinite. The Superintendent did not reproach them. Instead, he pondered deeply, and made many plans for the following day. The night shift did not go on that evening. At two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl dismally. From somewhere within the works a dog barked in answer; either to the coyote\u2014or to something else. A storm was gathering around the peaks of the range, and weirdly shaped clouds scudded horribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a gibbous moon\u2019s attempts to shine through many layers of cirro-stratus vapours."}

They had been removed by the strong high-pressure system many hours ago. This weather event, after defeating most of the storm clouds. Calming the rough winds, had carried away the ghostly front that had been the object of their fear. This was the pale rain-goddess the worried citizens watched. Local stories said it was the sign of a great flood that once happened as a disaster upon those low lansd. Just what the pale, watery signs could have meant, the forecaster was not sure. But he suspected they were the creators of the unstable skies. The observer could not make a definite forecast. But by careful watching, he got a very significant report about the approaching weather power.\n###\nAccording to the meteorologist, the impending tempest and the anomalous conditions were no more, having been dispelled by the relentless high-pressure system many hours ago. This atmospheric phenomenon, after vanquishing most of the cumulonimbus formations and stilling the turbulent winds, had borne away the spectral front which had been the object of their dread; the pallid precipitation-goddess which the anxious citizens monitored, and which was held by local folklore to be the harbinger of a deluge that had once reigned as a cataclysm upon those lowlands. Just what the pale, aqueous manifestations could have portended, the forecaster had no certainty, but he suspected they were the architects of the unsettled skies. The observer could form no definitive prognosis, but by diligent scrutiny obtained a most portentous bulletin of the looming atmospheric deity."}

In March the digging had been in a spot where no grave was known; but this time a well-marked and cared-for grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose, and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day before. Members of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed their astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor. Hazard Weeden of 598 Angell Street recalls a family legend according to which Ezra Weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances, not dishonourable to himself, shortly before the Revolution; but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant. Inspector Cunningham has been assigned to the case, and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near future. Residents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd, according to most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours, probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with this incident; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs. The aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all agreed in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him. The morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time, but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator.

I remembered what instructions had written to me about those earlier mornings. I shook to think there would be no cream. Nor did I like the way the kitchen sat sheltered beside that huge, cabinet. This cabinet led up to the counter's unvisited top. With a serious decision, I measured the coffee grounds. I turned the machine to a setting. I placed it on the far burner next to the pale container of sugar. But later I was sorry I had done this. It made the machine's stressed, bubbling noises. Weak steam look terribly It seemed almost unable to finish.

Nor did I like the way the kitchenette nestled in the lee of that colossal, shadowed cabinet leading up to the counter\u2019s unvisited summit. With a grim resolve I measured the dark grounds, turned the machine low, and set it upon the distant burner beside the ghostly canister of sugar; but afterward I was sorry I had done so, for it made the appliance\u2019s strained, gurgling noises and listless steam look damnably abnormal and alchemical. It seemed half-incapable of completion, though I saw the pot fill incrementally once in a while."}

So group of twenty police officers went out in the late afternoon. Thye filled two carriages and one automobile. The shaking settler went as their guide. They got out at the end of thhe drivable road. For miles they walked quietly through the awflu cypress woods where daylight never recahed. Twisted Ugly roots and harmful hanging loops of Spanish moss were ALL around them. Then a pile of wet stones. A piece of a rotting wall made the sadness worse. Every misshapen tree and every fungus-covered small island added to this feeling. Finally the settler village came into viwe. It was a poor cluster of huts. Very upset people ran out to gather around the moving lanterns. The muted beat of drums could now be heard faintly, very far ahead. A blood-curdling scream came now and then when the wind changed. A red glow also seemed to come through the thin bushes beyond endless paths of forest darkness. Too scared to be left alone again, every one of the frightened settlers flatly refused to go another inch toward the place of the unholy ceremony.

At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before."}

The flickering and mysterious charging icon was feared. The pale glow of the screen was deeply disliked. In the last hour or two, the device had obviously changed a lot. It stopped trying to work.

It was not the picture of one whom a criminal world person would be likely to know. Of a lady of good family. Quality, dressed in the odd clothes of thirty years before. Old Bugs himself seemed also to belong to the psat, for his hard-to-describe clothing showed every sign of great age. He was a man of great height, probably more than six feet, though his bent shoulders sometimes hid this fact. His hair, a dirty white and falling out in spots, was never combed. Over his thin face grew a sickly stubble of roguh beard which seemed always to stay at the short stageyet never long enough to form a proper set of whiskers. His faetures had perhaps been fine once. Were now lined with the awful effects of terrible drinking. At one timehe had clearly bene very fat. Now he was horribly thin, the purple skin hanging in loose bags under his watery eyes. On his cheeks. Altogether, Old Bugs was not ncie to look at. The nature of Old Bugs was as strange as his look. Ordinarily he was true to the abandoned typebut at rare times he showed the qualities which earned him his name. Then he would try to stand up straight. A certain fire wuold enter the deep-set eyes. His behavior would take on an unusual grace and even dignity. The drunken creatures around him would feel something of higher rnakand that one thing was his behavior when young men were brought for their first drink. The old man would then get up from the floor in anger. Excitement, whispering threats. Trying to persuade the beginners from starting their path of \u201cseeing life as it is\u201d.\n###\nThis he would sometimes draw from his tattered pocket, carefully unwrap from its covering of tissue paper, and gaze upon for hours with an expression of ineffable sadness and tenderness. It was not the portrait of one whom an underworld denizen would be likely to know, but of a lady of breeding and quality, garbed in the quaint attire of thirty years before. Old Bugs himself seemed also to belong to the past, for his nondescript clothing bore every hallmark of antiquity. He was a man of immense height, probably more than six feet, though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this fact. His hair, a dirty white and falling out in patches, was never combed; and over his lean face grew a mangy stubble of coarse beard which seemed always to remain at the bristling stage\u2014never shaven\u2014yet never long enough to form a respectable set of whiskers. His features had perhaps been noble once, but were now seamed with the ghastly effects of terrible dissipation. At one time\u2014probably in middle life\u2014he had evidently been grossly fat; but now he was horribly lean, the purple flesh hanging in loose pouches under his bleary eyes and upon his cheeks. Altogether, Old Bugs was not pleasing to look upon. The disposition of Old Bugs was as odd as his aspect. Ordinarily he was true to the derelict type\u2014ready to do anything for a nickel or a dose of whiskey or hasheesh\u2014but at rare intervals he shewed the traits which earned him his name. Then he would try to straighten up, and a certain fire would creep into the sunken eyes. His demeanour would assume an unwonted grace and even dignity; and the sodden creatures around him would sense something of superiority\u2014something which made them less ready to give the usual kicks and cuffs to the poor butt and drudge. At these times he would shew a sardonic humour and make remarks which the folk of Sheehan\u2019s deemed foolish and irrational. But the spells would soon pass, and once more Old Bugs would resume his eternal floor-scrubbing and cuspidor-cleaning. But for one thing Old Bugs would have been an ideal slave to the establishment\u2014and that one thing was his conduct when young men were introduced for their first drink. The old man would then rise from the floor in anger and excitement, muttering threats and warnings, and seeking to dissuade the novices from embarking upon their course of \u201cseeing life as it is\u201d."}

The microwave, it seems, had turning glass plates in some models. But the homeowner put his cold meal inside the humming box. He did this no doubt because it was more certain to heat the food evenly. The age of the abandoned meal appears to have been very great. The machine's internal waves could make it safe to eat for a short. The eater seems to have had no problem adjusting to part-time. Later, of course, full-time, watching in front of the glowing door. This is because he had never let his patience grow weak.

The strangset sound qualities had been whispered about it. As it happened, I met all these silences without valuing or understanding them. Their core and nature became completely disturbing. Their feeling was almost unbearable. One September afternoon, an unexpected plunge into one caused deep unease in a scholar. He had come to look at a rare large book.

As it happened, I encountered all these silences unappreciated and uncomprehended. Their essence and character became utterly unnerving, and their atmosphere almost intolerable.

In the second ccase, the method was easier and more physical. Wtih the right mechanical help, a mind would send itself forward in time. It would feel its vague, extra-sensory way until it got close to the wanted period. Then, after some test tries, it would take over the best available example of the highest life form of that time. It would enter that creature's brain. It would set up its own thought patterns there. The mind that was pushed out would go back to the time of the mind that took over. It would stay in that body until the process was reversed. The sent mind, now in the body of a future creature, would then act as a member of the species whose shape it had. It would learn as fast as possible everything that could be learned about the chosen time. This included its collected information and methods.\n###\nIn the latter case the course was easier and more material. With suitable mechanical aid a mind would project itself forward in time, feeling its dim, extra-sensory way till it approached the desired period. Then, after preliminary trials, it would seize on the best discoverable representative of the highest of that period\u2019s life-forms; entering the organism\u2019s brain and setting up therein its own vibrations while the displaced mind would strike back to the period of the displacer, remaining in the latter\u2019s body till a reverse process was set up. The projected mind, in the body of the organism of the future, would then pose as a member of the race whose outward form it wore; learning as quickly as possible all that could be learned of the chosen age and its massed information and techniques."}

Using the disorder of both college work. City health rules, he managed to have a body brought into the university dissecting - room one night. In my presence, he injected a version of his solution. The thing opened its eyes. But it stared at the ceiling with a look of soul - freezing horror. it fell into a state from which nothing could wake it. West said it was not. The summer air is not for corpses. That time, we were caught before we burned the thing. West doubted if it was to repeat his misuse of the college laboratory. The point of the epidemic was reached in August. West and I were, and Dr. Halsey did die on the 14th. students all went to the funeral on the 15th. They bouhgt an wreath, though it was overshadowed by the gifts sent by Arkham citizens. By the city itself. It was a event, for the dean had been a helper. After the burial, we were. We spent the afternoon at the bar of the Commercial House,. West, though shaken by the death of his opponent, chilled the rest of us by talking about his - known theories. As evening came, students went or to duties. But West convinced me to help him \" make a night of it \". West 's landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning. We had a man between us. She told her husband we had eaten and drunk. this - tongued woman was. For 3, the house was woken by cries from West 's room. When they broke down the door, they foudn the two of us on the blood - stained carpet. We were beaten, scratched, and hurt. The pieces of West 's bottles and instruments were around us. an window showed what had happened to our attacker. wondered how he had managed aftre the jump from the floor to the lawn he msut have made. There were some clothes in the room. But West, when he woke up, said they did not belong to the stranger. They were samples collceted for germ analysis during research on how germ diseases spread.\n###\nWest could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe, but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines. Taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations, he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university dissecting-room one night, and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution. The thing actually opened its eyes, but only stared at the ceiling with a look of soul-petrifying horror before collapsing into an inertness from which nothing could rouse it. West said it was not fresh enough\u2014the hot summer air does not favour corpses. That time we were almost caught before we incinerated the thing, and West doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of the college laboratory. The peak of the epidemic was reached in August. West and I were almost dead, and Dr. Halsey did die on the 14th. The students all attended the hasty funeral on the 15th, and bought an impressive wreath, though the latter was quite overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy Arkham citizens and by the municipality itself. It was almost a public affair, for the dean had surely been a public benefactor. After the entombment we were all somewhat depressed, and spent the afternoon at the bar of the Commercial House; where West, though shaken by the death of his chief opponent, chilled the rest of us with references to his notorious theories. Most of the students went home, or to various duties, as the evening advanced; but West persuaded me to aid him in \u201cmaking a night of it\u201d. West\u2019s landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning, with a third man between us; and told her husband that we had all evidently dined and wined rather well. Apparently this acidulous matron was right; for about 3 a.m. the whole house was aroused by cries coming from West\u2019s room, where when they broke down the door they found the two of us unconscious on the blood-stained carpet, beaten, scratched, and mauled, and with the broken remnants of West\u2019s bottles and instruments around us. Only an open window told what had become of our assailant, and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made. There were some strange garments in the room, but West upon regaining consciousness said they did not belong to the stranger, but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases."}

As we went down the shaft, the sound below grew clearly made of many parts. It struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of drums. Chanting of many voices. I have, as you know, been much in India. Romero and I moved without much hesitation through tunnels and down ladders. We always moved toward the thing that attracted us. Always with a pitifully helpless fear. At one time I thought I had gone mad. This was when, wondering how our way was lit in the absence of lamp. Candle, I realized that the ancient ring on my [THING] was glowing with a strange light. It spread a pale shine through the damp, heavy air around. It was without warning that Romero, after climbing down one of the many rough ladders, broke into a run. Left me alone. Wild note in the drumming. Chanting, barely noticeable to me, had acted on him in a startling way. With a wild cry he rushed ahead unguided in the cave 's darkness.

As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite. It struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting of many voices. I have, as you are aware, been much in India. Romero and I moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance. At one time I fancied I had gone mad\u2014this was when, on wondering how our way was lighted in the absence of lamp or candle, I realised that the ancient ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance, diffusing a pallid lustre through the damp, heavy air around. It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the many rude ladders, broke into a run and left me alone. Some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on him in startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the cavern\u2019s gloom. I heard his repeated shrieks before me, as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders. And frightened as I was, I yet retained enough of perception to note that his speech, when articulate, was not of any sort known to me. Harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad Spanish and worse English, and of these only the oft repeated cry \u201cHuitzilopotchli\u201d seemed in the least familiar. Later I definitely placed that word in the works of a great historian\u2014and shuddered when the association came to me. The climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief, beginning just as I reached the final cavern of the journey. Out of the darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I could never hear again and survive. In that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race. Simultaneously the light from my ring was extinguished, and I saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a few yards ahead of me."}

When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came from Boston in 1738 to be rector of King\u2019s Church, he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much; but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his host\u2019s discourse. Charles Ward told his father, when they discussed Curwen one winter evening, that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all diarists agree concerning Dr. Checkley\u2019s reluctance to repeat anything he had heard. The good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed. More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and scientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section. He lived in considerable style and comfort, keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town, and taking great pride in his telescope, his microscope, and his well-chosen library of English and Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the best library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been. His admiration for his host\u2019s ample shelves, which besides the Greek, Latin, and English classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical, mathematical, and scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr. Merritt\u2019s coach. Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing. Perhaps, however, the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice."}

It was a emptiness that would have made me doutb my own trying senses. However, from across that sun-scorched ground came a solid proof. The stillness was total. It was the unbroken that only emptiness can show. It comes only in hours of the most total desertion or being alone. I listened carefully in the silence. I heard no interruption. Afterward I stayed in the faint I shook wiht heat and wonder. I did this until I saw the far street light's sharp cast of shadow on the ground. This was from the angle of the overhead sun. Believing the scene had just become calm after the morning's departure. I began my watch again. At the same time, I noted the details with an orderly close look. I saw the concrete cracks open toward the edge. They split both the piece and the joint. Then I saw the painted lines. They unclearly marked the areas to show the zones. This time the nature of the abandoned place was clear. Its whitened surface shone with a ghostly clearness. It lay spread out in the It lay like a daed body spreads out in a desert's bowl.\n###\nThen one noon as I observed the expanse I saw the silent asphalt stretch into a desolate panorama of space; a vacancy which would have led me to doubt my own straining senses had there not come from across that sun-blasted pavement a palpable proof that the stillness was absolute\u2014the profound, unbroken hush which only emptiness can manifest, and which descends only in hours of the most complete abandonment or solitude. I listened intently in the silence, but perceived no disturbance. Afterward I lingered in the pale radiance, trembling with heat and awe, till I saw the distant lamppost\u2019s stark projection of shadow upon the ground by the angle of the zenith sun. Believing the scene just settled after the morning\u2019s exodus, I renewed my vigil, at the same time noting the details with a methodical scrutiny. I saw the concrete cracks yawn toward the curb and split both slab and seam, then saw the painted lines, which they ambiguously delineated to mark the zones. This time the character of the forsaken place was undeniable; for its bleached surface glared with a spectral clarity while it sprawled in the light as a corpse sprawls in a desert\u2019s crucible."}

After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comet\u2019s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus. Out of that dream came rescue\u2014the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He could not tell\u2014they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories. That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine\u2014this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still lives. Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise."}

It was made of frus and tent cloth taken from Lake's camp. We did not stop to study the shapes the fabrics were cut into. Slightly beyond this point we saw a clear increase in the size. Number of side passages. We decided we must have reached the densely honeycombed area under the higher foothills. The unknown smell was now oddly mixed with another, almost as smell. We could not guess its nature. We thought of rotting living things and maybe unknown underground fungi. Then came a surprising widening of the tunnel. The carvings had not prepared us for this. It broadened and rose into a tall, natural-looking oval cave with a flat floor. It was about 75 feet and 50 feet Many huge side passages led away into hidden darkness. Though this cave looked natural, looking with both torches suggested it was made by artificially breaking several walls between nearby honeycomb areas. The walls were rough. The arched roof was with hanging stone spikes. But the solid rock floor had been smoothed. It was free from all rubble, debris, or even dust to a very abnormal degree. Except for the path we came by, this was true for the floors of all the passages opening from it. The oddness of this condition made us puzzle uselessly. The curious stink that added to the unknown smell was very strong here. It was so strong it wiped out all trcae of the other. Something about this whole place, with its polished. Almost shiny floor, struck us as more vaguely confusing. than any monstrous thing we met before. The regularity of the passage straight ahead. The larger amuont of penguin droppings there, prevented all confusion about the right way among this excess of equally cave mouths. Still, we decided to restart our paper trail-blazing if any more complexity appeared. We could no longer expect dust tracks, of course. Upon continuing our direct path, we shone a torch beam on the tunnel walls. We stopped suddenly in surprise at the extremely radical change that had come over carvings in this part of the passage.\n###\nThe temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was composed of furs and tent-cloth taken from Lake\u2019s camp, and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed. Slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the side-galleries, and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been reached. The nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odour\u2014of what nature we could not guess, though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrene fungi. Then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us\u2014a broadening and rising into a lofty, natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor; some 75 feet long and 50 broad, and with many immense side-passages leading away into cryptical darkness. Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings. The walls were rough, and the high vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all debris, detritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent. Except for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of the floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling. The curious new foetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the other. Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost glistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered. The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion of penguin-droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great cave-mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trail-blazing if any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course, could no longer be expected. Upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel walls\u2014and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage."}

I found my Spanish was from the speech of the worker in New Spain. The event I wlil describe had no warning signs. The man Romero had interested me. My ring had affected him in a way. But I think neither of us expected what would happen after the explosion. reasons had required extending the mine from the area. The Superintendent believed rock would be found. This led to using a amount of dynamite. Romero and I were not invovled in this work. we learned of conditions from others. The blast, than planned, seemed to shake the mountain. Windows in shacks on the slope were broken by the force. Miners in the nearer tunnels were knocked down. Jewel Lake, which was above the blast site, moved as if in storm. Looking into it, they saw a pit opened below the explosion point. The pit was that no rope on hand could measure its depth. No lamp could light it up., the diggers asked to meet with the Superintendent. He ordered ropes to be taken to the hole. They were to be tied and lowered without stopping until a bottom was found., the workers told the Superintendent they had failed., they said they would not go to the pit. They would not work in the mine until it might be closed. Something beyond their experience was facing them. as they could tell, the emptiness had no end. The Superintendent did not blame them., he thought and made plans for the day. The night shitf did not work that evening. At two in the morning, a coyote on the mountain began to howl. From in the works, a dog barked in reply. It was answering the coyote \u2014 or something. A storm was gathering around the mountain peaks. shaped clouds raced across the patch of sky light. Tihs light was a - moon trying to shine through layers of, clouds.\n###\nOur conversation was necessarily limited. He knew but a few words of English, while I found my Oxonian Spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of New Spain. The event which I am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions. Though the man Romero had interested me, and though my ring had affected him peculiarly, I think that neither of us had any expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off. Geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite. With this work Romero and I were not connected, wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others. The charge, heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entire mountain. Windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock, whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet. Jewel Lake, which lay above the scene of action, heaved as in a tempest. Upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast; an abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathom it, nor any lamp illuminate it. Baffled, the excavators sought a conference with the Superintendent, who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit, and spliced and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered. Shortly afterward the pale-faced workmen apprised the Superintendent of their failure. Firmly though respectfully they signified their refusal to revisit the chasm, or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be sealed. Something beyond their experience was evidently confronting them, for so far as they could ascertain, the void below was infinite. The Superintendent did not reproach them. Instead, he pondered deeply, and made many plans for the following day. The night shift did not go on that evening. At two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl dismally. From somewhere within the works a dog barked in answer; either to the coyote\u2014or to something else. A storm was gathering around the peaks of the range, and weirdly shaped clouds scudded horribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a gibbous moon\u2019s attempts to shine through many layers of cirro-stratus vapours."}

It was typical of him that tihs thuoght had no scary meaning. Undisturbed by heavy thoughts about the time, the place. What lay under his feet,, he calmly chipped at the brick. He cursed when a piece hit his face. He laughed when a piece hit the excited horse near the cypress tree. The hole grew large enough that he tried to fit his body in it sometimes. He shifted so the coffins under him moved and made noise. He found he would not need to add another coffin to his pile to reach the right height. The hole was at the perfect level to use once it was big enough.\n###\nDusk fell and found Birch still toiling. He worked largely by feeling now, since newly gathered clouds hid the moon; and though progress was still slow, he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture. He could, he was sure, get out by midnight\u2014though it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with eerie implications. Undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time, the place, and the company beneath his feet, he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork; cursing when a fragment hit him in the face, and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree. In time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and then, shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked. He would not, he found, have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height; for the hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permit."}

We took off over the nightmare city. Below us, the stonework spread out as it had when we saw it. That was, yet, a time. We began rising. Turning to test the wind for our crossing through the mountain pass. At a level, there must have been disturbance. The ice - dust clouds at the top of the sky were doing all sorts of things. At 24,000 feet, the height we needed for the pass, we found flying. As we got to the jutting peaks, the wind 's piping sound became. I could see Danforth 's hands trembling at the controls. Rank amateur though I was, I thought at that moment I might be a pilot than he was for making the crossing between peaks. When I made motions to change seats. Take over his duties, he did not protest. I tried to keep all my skill and calm aobut me. I stared at the section of sky between the walls of the pass. I refused to pay attention to the puffs of vapor from the mountain tops. I wished I had wax - stopped ears like Ulysses ' men near the Sirens ' coast. That would keep that wind - piping out of my mind. But Danforth, freed from his piloting. Wound up to a state, could not keep. I felt him turning. Moving as he looked at the receding city. He looked at the cave - filled, cube - covered peaks. He looked at the sea of foothills coveerd with walls. He looked at the boiling, clouded sky. It was, as I was trying to steer through the pass, that his shrieking brought us to disaster. It broke my hold on myself. Made me with the controls for a moment. A, my determination won and we made the crossing. Yet I am that Danforth wlil be the. I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what horror made him scream out. I feel that horror is for his breakdown. We had bits of shouted conversation above the wind 's piping and the engine 's buzzing. This was as we reached the side of the mountain range. Swooped toward the camp. That talk had to do with the promises of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city.\n###\nDanforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a very smooth takeoff over the nightmare city. Below us the primal Cyclopean masonry spread out as it had done when first we saw it\u2014so short, yet infinitely long, a time ago\u2014and we began rising and turning to test the wind for our crossing through the pass. At a very high level there must have been great disturbance, since the ice-dust clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things; but at 24,000 feet, the height we needed for the pass, we found navigation quite practicable. As we drew close to the jutting peaks the wind\u2019s strange piping again became manifest, and I could see Danforth\u2019s hands trembling at the controls. Rank amateur though I was, I thought at that moment that I might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between pinnacles; and when I made motions to change seats and take over his duties he did not protest. I tried to keep all my skill and self-possession about me, and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass\u2014resolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of mountain-top vapour, and wishing that I had wax-stopped ears like Ulysses\u2019 men off the Sirens\u2019 coast to keep that disturbing wind-piping from my consciousness. But Danforth, released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch, could not keep quiet. I felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible receding city, ahead at the cave-riddled, cube-barnacled peaks, sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy, rampart-strown foothills, and upward at the seething, grotesquely clouded sky. It was then, just as I was trying to steer safely through the pass, that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by shattering my tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a moment. A second afterward my resolution triumphed and we made the crossing safely\u2014yet I am afraid that Danforth will never be the same again. I have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanely\u2014a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted conversation above the wind\u2019s piping and the engine\u2019s buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city."}

I realized that brief, glimmering visoins from hours must have been warning symptoms. Those visions disturbed me because they were. My head was aching. I had a feeling that was to me. I felt that someone was trying to take control of my thoughts. The collapse happened about 10:20 a.m. I was teaching a class in Political Economy VI. The class was on the history and trends of economics. It was for juniors and a sophomores. I began to see shapes before my eyes. I felt I was in a room that was not the classroom. My thoughts and speech wandered from the subject. The students saw that something was. I slumped down, in my chair. I was in a stupor from which no one could wake me. Nor did my faculties look out upon the daylight of our world for five years, four months., I learned what followed from others. I showed no sign of consciousness for sixteen and a half hours. I was taken to my home at 27 Crane St. I was given the care. At 3 a.m. On May 15 my eyes opened and I began to speak. the doctors. My family were frightened by the direction of my expression.

The movements of my muscles weer. my speech seemed and. I used my voice and. My way of speaking had a qualit.y It was as if I.\n###\nIt was on Thursday, May 14, 1908, that the queer amnesia came. The thing was quite sudden, though later I realised that certain brief, glimmering visions of several hours previous\u2014chaotic visions which disturbed me greatly because they were so unprecedented\u2014must have formed premonitory symptoms. My head was aching, and I had a singular feeling\u2014altogether new to me\u2014that someone else was trying to get possession of my thoughts. The collapse occurred about 10:20 a.m., while I was conducting a class in Political Economy VI\u2014history and present tendencies of economics\u2014for juniors and a few sophomores. I began to see strange shapes before my eyes, and to feel that I was in a grotesque room other than the classroom. My thoughts and speech wandered from my subject, and the students saw that something was gravely amiss. Then I slumped down, unconscious in my chair, in a stupor from which no one could arouse me. Nor did my rightful faculties again look out upon the daylight of our normal world for five years, four months, and thirteen days. It is, of course, from others that I have learned what followed. I shewed no sign of consciousness for sixteen and a half hours, though removed to my home at 27 Crane St. and given the best of medical attention. At 3 a.m. May 15 my eyes opened and I began to speak, but before long the doctors and my family were thoroughly frightened by the trend of my expression and language. It was clear that I had no remembrance of my identity or of my past, though for some reason I seemed anxious to conceal this lack of knowledge. My eyes gazed strangely at the persons around me, and the flexions of my facial muscles were altogether unfamiliar. Even my speech seemed awkward and foreign. I used my vocal organs clumsily and gropingly, and my diction had a curiously stilted quality, as if I had laboriously learned the English language from books. The pronunciation was barbarously alien, whilst the idiom seemed to include both scraps of curious archaism and expressions of a wholly incomprehensible cast. Of the latter one in particular was very potently\u2014even terrifiedly\u2014recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward. For at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currency\u2014first in England and then in the United States\u2014and though of much complexity and indisputable newness, it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham patient of 1908."}

He believes the man spoke from a brain to the brain he had observed for twenty - six years. Controversy with Dr. Lyman has forced him to be.

They are not in the style of his letter to Willett.,, they are and -. It is as if the breaking of the writer 's mind released a flood of tendencies. These were picked up during his childhood interest in antiquities. There is attempt to sound. But the spirit, and the language, belong to the past. The past was in Ward 's every tone and gesture. This happened as he greeted the doctor in that. He bowed. He motioned Willett to a seat. He began to speak in that whisper. He tried to explain this whisper from the start. Willett was studying these rasping tones. But he was studying the speaker 's face. Something, he felt, was. He thought about what the family had told him. They spoke of the fright of that Yorkshire butler one night. He wishde it were not. But he did not ask for any to be opene.d,, he asked Ward why he had.

Controversy with Dr. Lyman has compelled him to be very specific, and he definitely dates the madness of Charles Ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents. Those notes are not in Ward\u2019s normal style; not even in the style of that last frantic letter to Willett. Instead, they are strange and archaic, as if the snapping of the writer\u2019s mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism. There is an obvious effort to be modern, but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the past. The past, too, was evident in Ward\u2019s every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned Willett to a seat, and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outset. Willett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but studying even more closely the face of the speaker. Something, he felt, was wrong; and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that Yorkshire butler one night. He wished it were not so dark, but did not request that any blind be opened. Instead, he merely asked Ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a week before. \u201cI was coming to that,\u201d the host replied. \u201cYou must know, I am in a very bad state of nerves, and do and say queer things I cannot account for. As I have told you often, I am on the edge of great matters; and the bigness of them has a way of making me light-headed. Any man might well be frighted of what I have found, but I am not to be put off for long. I was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home; for having gone this far, my place is here. I am not well spoke of by my prying neighbours, and perhaps I was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me. There is no evil to any in what I do, so long as I do it rightly."}

Two of the small tents were crushed flat despite their protective [THING] walls. Wooden surfaces left outside in the blast were marked with small holes. Stripped of paint. All signs of tracks in the [THING] were totally erased. It is also true we found noen of the Archaean biological specimens in a state fit to remove whole. We did collect some minerals from a huge collapsed pile. This included several greneish soapstone pieces. Their odd five - sided rounded shape and faint patterns of clustered dots caused many uncertain comparisons. We also collected some fossil bones. Among these were the most typical of the strangely damaged samples. None of the dogs survived. Their quickly built [THING] pen near the camp was almost totally ruined. The [THING] may have caused that. The greater damage was on the side nearest the camp, which was not the side facing the [THING]. This suggests the panicked animals themselves jumped or broke out. All three sleds were missing. We have tried to explain the [THING] may have blown them away into the unknown. The drill and ice - melting machines at the boring were too badly damaged to save. We used them to block up that deeply unsettling gateway to the past which Lake had blasted open. We also left at the camp the two most damaged planes. Our surviving group had only four real pilotsin total. Danforth was in too poor a nervous state to fly. We brought back all the books, scientific gear, and other items we could find. However, much was unaccountably blown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or in very bad condition. It was about 4 P.M. After extensive plane searching forced us to declare Gedney lost, we sent our careful message to the Arkham for passing on. I think we did well to keep it as calm and vague as we managed.

The exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blast were pitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated. It is also true that we found none of the Archaean biological objects in a condition to take outside as a whole. We did gather some minerals from a vast tumbled pile, including several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many doubtful comparisons; and some fossil bones, among which were the most typical of the curiously injured specimens. None of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow enclosure near the camp being almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that, though the greater breakage on the side next the camp, which was not the windward one, suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves. All three sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting machinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so we used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past which Lake had blasted. We likewise left at the camp the two most shaken-up of the planes; since our surviving party had only four real pilots\u2014Sherman, Danforth, McTighe, and Ropes\u2014in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate. We brought back all the books, scientific equipment, and other incidentals we could find, though much was rather unaccountably blown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of condition. It was approximately 4 P.M., after wide plane cruising had forced us to give Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and non-committal as we succeeded in doing. The most we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor Lake\u2019s accounts."}

Three of the men who had been with Ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were not any real ruins. Only the bricks of the chimney, the stones of the cellar, some mineral and metallic litter here and there, and the rim of that nefandous well. Save for Ammi\u2019s dead horse, which they towed away and buried, and the buggy which they shortly returned to him, everything that had ever been living had gone. Five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert remained, nor has anything ever grown there since. To this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields, and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in spite of the rural tales have named it \u201cthe blasted heath\u201d. The rural tales are queer. They might be even queerer if city men and college chemists could be interested enough to analyse the water from that disused well, or the grey dust that no wind seems ever to disperse. Botanists, too, ought to study the stunted flora on the borders of that spot, for they might shed light on the country notion that the blight is spreading\u2014little by little, perhaps an inch a year. People say the colour of the neighbouring herbage is not quite right in the spring, and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow. Snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere. Horses\u2014the few that are left in this motor age\u2014grow skittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot depend on their dogs too near the splotch of greyish dust. They say the mental influences are very bad, too. Numbers went queer in the years after Nahum\u2019s taking, and always they lacked the power to get away. Then the stronger-minded folk all left the region, and only the foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads. They could not stay, though; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild, weird stores of whispered magic have given them. Their dreams at night, they protest, are very horrible in that grotesque country; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir a morbid fancy. No traveller has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirit as of the eye."}

I could not at understand the change. But a kind of comparison began to push into my mind. This happened though my mind refused to admit the suspicion of it. It was that the expression of these faces suggested something it had not suggested. That something would bring panic if thought of. The shock came when my uncle showed me the Orne jewelry in a downtown - deposit box. Some items were and inspiring. But there was one box of pieces from my - grandmother. My uncle was to produce them. He said they were of and design. To his knowledge, they had been worn in public. But my grandmother used to enjoy lookign at them. legends of luck surrounded them. My - grandmother 's governess had said they should not be worn in New England. But it would be to wera them in Europe. As my uncle began. to unwrap the things, he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness. ugliness of the designs. Experts and archaeologists who had seen them said the work was and. No one could define their material. Assign them to any art tradition. There were two armbands, a crown, and a kind of chest piece. The chest piece had in relief figures of extravagance. During this description I had kept control of my emotiosn. But my face must have shown my growing fears. My uncle looked and paused in his unwrapping to study my face. I motioned for him to continue. He did with renewed signs of reluctance. He seemed to expect some reaction when the piece, the crown, became. But I doubt he expected what happened. I did not expect it, for I thought I was warned about what the jewelry would turn out to be. What I did was, as I had done in that - choked railway cut a year. From that day on my life has been a nightmare of thought and fear. I do not know how is truht and how is madness.\n###\nNow, years after their passing, I gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation. I could not at first understand the change, but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it. It was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested before\u2014something which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of. But the worst shock came when my uncle shewed me the Orne jewellery in a downtown safe-deposit vault. Some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough, but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious great-grandmother which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce. They were, he said, of very grotesque and almost repulsive design, and had never to his knowledge been publicly worn; though my grandmother used to enjoy looking at them. Vague legends of bad luck clustered around them, and my great-grandmother\u2019s French governess had said they ought not to be worn in New England, though it would be quite safe to wear them in Europe. As my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs. Artists and archaeologists who had seen them pronounced the workmanship superlatively and exotically exquisite, though no one seemed able to define their exact material or assign them to any specific art tradition. There were two armlets, a tiara, and a kind of pectoral; the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance. During this description I had kept a tight rein on my emotions, but my face must have betrayed my mounting fears. My uncle looked concerned, and paused in his unwrapping to study my countenance. I motioned to him to continue, which he did with renewed signs of reluctance. He seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piece\u2014the tiara\u2014became visible, but I doubt if he expected quite what actually happened. I did not expect it, either, for I thought I was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewellery would turn out to be. What I did was to faint silently away, just as I had done in that brier-choked railway cut a year before. From that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension, nor do I know how much is hideous truth and how much madness."}

During thsi telling my friend Manton had become very quiet. I saw my words had affected him. He did not laugh when I paused. He asked quite seriously about the boy who went mad in 1793. He had presumably been the hero of my story. I told him why the boy had gone to that avoided, deserted house.

The memory had lingered hideously\u2014all the more hideous because it was so secret. During this narration my friend Manton had become very silent, and I saw that my words had impressed him. He did not laugh as I paused, but asked quite seriously about the boy who went mad in 1793, and who had presumably been the hero of my fiction. I told him why the boy had gone to that shunned, deserted house, and remarked that he ought to be interested, since he believed that windows retained latent images of those who had sat at them. The boy had gone to look at the windows of that horrible attic, because of tales of things seen behind them, and had come back screaming maniacally. Manton remained thoughtful as I said this, but gradually reverted to his analytical mood. He granted for the sake of argument that some unnatural monster had really existed, but reminded me that even the most morbid perversion of Nature need not be unnamable or scientifically indescribable. I admired his clearness and persistence, and added some further revelations I had collected among the old people. Those later spectral legends, I made plain, related to monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be; apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes only tangible, which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the old house, the crypt behind it, and the grave where a sapling had sprouted beside an illegible slab. Whether or not such apparitions had ever gored or smothered people to death, as told in uncorroborated traditions, they had produced a strong and consistent impression; and were yet darkly feared by very aged natives, though largely forgotten by the last two generations\u2014perhaps dying for lack of being thought about. Moreover, so far as aesthetic theory was involved, if the psychic emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions, what coherent representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a nebulosity as the spectre of a malign, chaotic perversion, itself a morbid blasphemy against Nature? Moulded by the dead brain of a hybrid nightmare, would not such a vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome truth the exquisitely, the shriekingly unnamable? \u201cThere were some bones up under the eaves. They may have been what that boy saw\u2014if he was sensitive he wouldn\u2019t have needed anything in the window-glass to unhinge him."}

Once they had quite a few mills, but nothing\u2019s left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time. \u201cThat refinery, though, used to be a big thing, and Old Man Marsh, who owns it, must be richer\u2019n Croesus. Queer old duck, though, and sticks mighty close in his home. He\u2019s supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight.

The powder was spoken of, Charles showed his sign of interest. A look came over his face when he heard what Willett had read from the notepad. He said that those notes were. They meant nothing to anyone not trained in magic 's history. \" he added, \" if you had known the words to summon what I had in the cup, you would not be to tell me this. I think you would have trembled if you had found it in my list in the room. Twas was raised by me. I planned to raise it that day you came to inivte me. \" Willett described the words he had said. He told of the - smoke that had appeared. As he spoke, he saw fear appear for the time on Charles Ward 's face. \" It came, and you are? \" As Ward spoke the words. His voice seemed to break of its limits. It sank to, echoes. Willett, with a idea, thought he understood the situation. He wove a warning from a letter he recalled into his answer. \" No. 118, you say? But remember that stones are all changed in nine places out of ten. You are until you ask! \", without warning, he took out the message. He showed it before the patient 's eyes. He could not have wanted a reaction, for Charles Ward fainted. All this talk, of course, had been done with secrecy. The hospital doctors would not accuse the father. The doctor of encouraging a madman 's beliefs.,, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward lifted the man. They placed him on the couch. As he woke, the patient muttered times about some word. He said he must get it to Orne and Hutchinson at. when he seemed, the doctor told him this. He said that of those benigs, at one was his enemy. That one had given Dr. Allen advice for his murder. This news showed no effect. Before it was given, the visitors could see their host had the look of a man.\n###\nTruly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201chad you but known the words to bring up that which I had out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. \u2019 Twas Number 118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in t\u2019other room. \u2019 Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.\u201d Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on Charles Ward\u2019s face. \u201cIt came, and you be here alive?\u201d As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered. \u201cNo. 118, you say? But don\u2019t forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!\u201d And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patient\u2019s eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith. All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man."}

In the middle of a calm evening's rest with video games planned, a shcoking series of cries sounded from the study. Through the halls. This brought worried faces to every doorway. People near the main computer saw a flickering screen hanging motionless in the poorly lit space before the mahogany desk. There was a whirring of cooling fans in the computer case. But this stopped as soon as the upset user's noise became heard. Patries of technicians with diganostic tools and ethernet cables rushed to see what was hpapening. But their close look found nothing. The next morning, however, a huge, stubborn delay was confirmed on the home router's diagnostics. Thsi delay was stark in its slowness. The coaxial cable stretched out besdie the forgotten modme. The origin of this blockage became a topic for endless guessing and whispering. It was not so much the users as the older ones who whispered. Only the experienced users felt any memroy from that frozen progress bar with its frustration-swelling numbers. They, shuddering as they did, exchanged hidden murmurs of alarm and anger.

In the midst of a tranquil evening\u2019s repose with digital diversions planned there resounded from the study and through the halls a shocking series of lamentations which brought agitated faces to every doorway; and persons around the central terminal beheld a great, flickering screen hanging inertly within the poorly illuminated space before the mahogany desk. There was a whirring of cooling fans in the chassis, but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the aggrieved user became audible. Parties of technicians with diagnostic tools and ethernet cables hurried to discern what was transpiring, but nothing rewarded their scrutiny. The next morning, however, a colossal, unyielding latency, stark in its inefficiency, was confirmed upon the diagnostics of the domestic router, where the coaxial line stretched out beside the forgotten modem, and the provenance of this obstruction became a theme for endless speculation and whispering. It was not so much the neophytes as the older users who whispered, for only in the veterans did that glacial progress-bar with frustration-bulging numerals strike any chord of recollection. They, shuddering as they did so, exchanged furtive murmurs of dismay and ire; for in those sluggish, abominable metrics lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an echo\u2014and that echo was of a service that had languished full five years before."}

A digital clock showed me the time. For a short. I was in the humming room, looking over the countertop. The sink at the edge of the linoleum. The appliance itself. From its lit inside in the sterile glow, I could see the silent container from which last meal had been removed. It now held the thickened sauces from the night before. I also saw the set of condiments with their old crusts. Far inside the brooding interior were the distant old particles on the porcelain. They gleamed pale and ghostly. Just as I began to wait, I thouhgt I heard faint sounds from the machine. The sounds were rhythmic and half mechanical. They stirred in me a weird expectation that colored my watch. But when I got the plate next, I felt it had all been a trick. The vapors I had seen were more meaningful than any sound of humming coils in the night. Influenced by the warnings that the manual had told, my mind had. Waiting created a terrible feast in a giant kitchen. There, ceramic plates. Coatings, all spoke in certian whispers about the decay that was food-related. When I told this fancy to my friend we both shook.

A digital chronometer shewed me the interval, which was for a brief period within the humming chamber, overlooking the countertop, and the sink at the edge of the linoleum, and the appliance itself; so that I could perceive from its illuminated interior in the sterile glow the silent vessel from which the previous meal had been exiled and which now cradled the congealed sauces from the prior night, and too, the condiment array with its antique crusts, and far within the brooding interior the remote elder particles upon the porcelain gleaming pale and spectral. Just as I commenced to wait I fancied I heard faint emanations from the mechanism; emanations that were rhythmic and half mechanical, and stirred me with a weird anticipation which coloured my vigil. But when I retrieved the platter next I felt it had all been an illusion, for the vapours I had beheld were more portentous than any sound of humming coils in the night. Influenced by the warnings that the manual had related, my mind had in waiting conjured a terrible feast in a cyclopean kitchen, where ceramic plates and utensils, containers and vessels, residues and coatings, all spoke in certain whispers the decay that was culinary. When I recounted this fancy to my companion we both shuddered; but I shuddered the deeper, because he was perplexed about his sauces from the prior night. For the sixth time they had all congealed anomalously, reheating very slowly and unevenly, and tasting as if they had not transformed, although they were known to have been subjected to the prescribed radiations."}

But they weer interred in the suburb of _ _ ENT.\n###\nHis remains, notwithstanding the troubled state of Italy, were taken to Ravenna for interment; but being interred in the suburb of Classe, were exhumed and ridiculed by the Lombard Duke of Spoleto, who took his skull to King Autharis for use as a wassail-bowl. Ibid\u2019s skull was proudly handed down from king to king of the Lombard line. Upon the capture of Pavia by Charlemagne in 774, the skull was seized from the tottering Desiderius and carried in the train of the Frankish conqueror. It was from this vessel, indeed, that Pope Leo administered the royal unction which made of the hero-nomad a Holy Roman Emperor. Charlemagne took Ibid\u2019s skull to his capital at Aix, soon afterward presenting it to his Saxon teacher Alcuin, upon whose death in 804 it was sent to Alcuin\u2019s kinsfolk in England. It was captured by the private soldier Read-\u2019em-and-Weep Hopkins, who not long after traded it to Rest-in-Jehovah Stubbs for a quid of new Virginia weed. Stubbs, upon sending forth his son Zerubbabel to seek his fortune in New England in 1661 (for he thought ill of the Restoration atmosphere for a pious young yeoman), gave him St. Ibid\u2019s\u2014or rather Brother Ibid\u2019s, for he abhorred all that was Popish\u2014skull as a talisman. Upon landing in Salem Zerubbabel set it up in his cupboard beside the chimney, he having built a modest house near the town pump. However, he had not been wholly unaffected by the Restoration influence; and having become addicted to gaming, lost the skull to one Epenetus Dexter, a visiting freeman of Providence. It was in the house of Dexter, in the northern part of the town near the present intersection of North Main and Olney Streets, on the occasion of Canonchet\u2019s raid of March 30, 1676, during King Philip\u2019s War; and the astute sachem, recognising it at once as a thing of singular venerableness and dignity, sent it as a symbol of alliance to a faction of the Pequots in Connecticut with whom he was negotiating. On April 4 he was captured by the colonists and soon after executed, but the austere head of Ibid continued on its wanderings. From van Schaack, sad to say, the relic was stolen in 1683 by a French trader, Jean Grenier, whose Popish zeal recognised the features of one whom he had been taught at his mother\u2019s knee to revere as St. Ibide."}

He fell suddenly, as [THING] said, after a sailor - like black [THING] pushed him. That [THING] came from one of the odd dark alleys on steep hillside. That path was a short cut from the [THING] to his home in Williams Street. Physicians could not find any visible problem. But after confused talk, they decided some unclear heart damage was to blame. They thought the fast climb up such a steep hill by such an old [THING] caused his death. At the time, I saw no reason to disagree with this ruling. But lately, I am starting to wonder \u2014 and more than wonder. As my great - uncle 's heir. The [THING] in charge of his will, I was expected to look through his papers very carefully. He died a childless widower. For that job, I moved all his files and boxes to my rooms in Boston. Much of the material I put together will be published later by the American Archaeological Society. But there was one box I found very confusing. I really did not want to show it to anyone else. It had been locked. I did not find the key until I thought to check the personal ring the professor alwasy carreid in his pocket. Then I did open it. When I opened it, I only seemed to face a bigger. More tightly locked [THING]. What could be the meaning of the strange clay carving. The scattered notes, ramblings. Clippings I found? Had my uncle, in his later years, started to believe the most obvious fakes? I decided to find the odd sculptor who made this thing. It seemed to have disturbed an old [THING] 's peace. The carving was a rough rectangle. It was less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in size. It was clearly modern. Its designs, however, were not modern in feeling or suggestion. The changes of cubism and futurism are many and wild. But they do not often copy that hidden pattern that hides in prehistoric writing. Most of these designs certainly seemed to be some kind of writing. My memory knew my uncle 's papers and collections well. But it could not name this particular type at all. It could not even hint at its farthest connections.\n###\nThe professor had been stricken whilst returning from the Newport boat; falling suddenly, as witnesses said, after having been jostled by a nautical-looking negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased\u2019s home in Williams Street. Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end. At the time I saw no reason to dissent from this dictum, but latterly I am inclined to wonder\u2014and more than wonder. As my grand-uncle\u2019s heir and executor, for he died a childless widower, I was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness; and for that purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in Boston. Much of the material which I correlated will be later published by the American Archaeological Society, but there was one box which I found exceedingly puzzling, and which I felt much averse from shewing to other eyes. It had been locked, and I did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried always in his pocket. Then indeed I succeeded in opening it, but when I did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier. For what could be the meaning of the queer clay bas-relief and the disjointed jottings, ramblings, and cuttings which I found? Had my uncle, in his latter years, become credulous of the most superficial impostures? I resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man\u2019s peace of mind. The bas-relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area; obviously of modern origin. Its designs, however, were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion; for although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild, they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing. And writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be; though my memory, despite much familiarity with the papers and collections of my uncle, failed in any way to identify this particular species, or even to hint at its remotest affiliations."}

They came with and meaning. These were scenes showing the nameless city in its prime. They showed the plants in the valley around it. They showed the faraway lands its merchants traded with. The story of the crawling creatures confused me because it was. I wondered why it was followed in a pictured history of importance. In the wall paintings, the nameless city was shown in sizes suited to the reptiles. I wondered what its size and splendor had been. I thought for a moment about things I had noticed in the ruins. I thought about how the temples were. I thought about the hallway. These were carved that way to show respect to the reptile gods honored., it forced the worshippers to crawl. the ceremonies themselves involved crawling to copy the creatures. No idea could explain why the level passage in that descent should be as the temples. It was, since one could not kneel in it. As I thought of the crawling creatures, whose dried - out bodies were. to me, I felt a pulse of fear. connections in the mind are. I shrank from the idea that, except for the man torn in the painting, mine was the shape among the remains. Symbols of life. But as in my and life, wonder pushed out fear. The hole. What it might hold presented a problem of the explorer. I could not doubt that a world of mystery lay down that flight of steps. I hoped to find those reminders which the painted hallway had failed to provide. The wall paintings had shown cities, hills, and valleys in this kingdom. My imagination stayed on the and ruins that waited for me. My fears,, were the past than the future. Not the horror of my position in that hallway of reptiles. wall paintings could match the dread I felt. I was miles below the world I knew. I faced another world of light and fog. The dread came from the age of place and its spirit.\n###\nThen I sank prone to the stone floor, my mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a death-like exhaustion could banish. As I lay still with closed eyes, free to ponder, many things I had lightly noted in the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible significance\u2014scenes representing the nameless city in its heyday, the vegetation of the valley around it, and the distant lands with which its merchants traded. The allegory of the crawling creatures puzzled me by its universal prominence, and I wondered that it should be so closely followed in a pictured history of such importance. In the frescoes the nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the reptiles. I wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been, and reflected a moment on certain oddities I had noticed in the ruins. I thought curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the underground corridor, which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference to the reptile deities there honoured; though it perforce reduced the worshippers to crawling. Perhaps the very rites had involved a crawling in imitation of the creatures. No religious theory, however, could easily explain why the level passage in that awesome descent should be as low as the temples\u2014or lower, since one could not even kneel in it. As I thought of the crawling creatures, whose hideous mummified forms were so close to me, I felt a new throb of fear. Mental associations are curious, and I shrank from the idea that except for the poor primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting, mine was the only human form amidst the many relics and symbols of primordial life. But as always in my strange and roving existence, wonder soon drove out fear; for the luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a problem worthy of the greatest explorer. That a weird world of mystery lay far down that flight of peculiarly small steps I could not doubt, and I hoped to find there those human memorials which the painted corridor had failed to give. The frescoes had pictured unbelievable cities, hills, and valleys in this lower realm, and my fancy dwelt on the rich and colossal ruins that awaited me. My fears, indeed, concerned the past rather than the future. Not even the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes, miles below the world I knew and faced by another world of eerie light and mist, could match the lethal dread I felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul."}

Suydam was a lettered recluse of ancient Dutch family, possessed originally of barely independent means, and inhabiting the spacious but ill-preserved mansion which his grandfather had built in Flatbush when that village was little more than a pleasant group of colonial cottages surrounding the steepled and ivy-clad Reformed Church with its iron-railed yard of Netherlandish gravestones. In his lonely house, set back from Martense Street amidst a yard of venerable trees, Suydam had read and brooded for some six decades except for a period a generation before, when he had sailed for the old world and remained there out of sight for eight years. He could afford no servants, and would admit but few visitors to his absolute solitude; eschewing close friendships and receiving his rare acquaintances in one of the three ground-floor rooms which he kept in order\u2014a vast, high-ceiled library whose walls were solidly packed with tattered books of ponderous, archaic, and vaguely repellent aspect. The growth of the town and its final absorption in the Brooklyn district had meant nothing to Suydam, and he had come to mean less and less to the town. Elderly people still pointed him out on the streets, but to most of the recent population he was merely a queer, corpulent old fellow whose unkempt white hair, stubbly beard, shiny black clothes, and gold-headed cane earned him an amused glance and nothing more. Malone did not know him by sight till duty called him to the case, but had heard of him indirectly as a really profound authority on mediaeval superstition, and had once idly meant to look up an out-of-print pamphlet of his on the Kabbalah and the Faustus legend, which a friend had quoted from memory. Suydam became a \u201ccase\u201d when his distant and only relatives sought court pronouncements on his sanity. Their action seemed sudden to the outside world, but was really undertaken only after prolonged observation and sorrowful debate. It was based on certain odd changes in his speech and habits; wild references to impending wonders, and unaccountable hauntings of disreputable Brooklyn neighbourhoods. He had been growing shabbier and shabbier with the years, and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant; seen occasionally by humiliated friends in subway stations, or loitering on the benches around Borough Hall in conversation with groups of swarthy, evil-looking strangers."}

The oddities of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroadeven a beginning one \u2014 could pretend for. What brought up the idea of insanity at this time were the sounds heard at all hours from Ward 's laboratory, in which he kept himself of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and speeches in rhythms. These sounds were in Ward 's voice, there was something in the quality of that voice. In the accents of the formulas it said, which could not. Chill the blood of every listener. It was noticed that Ni,g the. Loved cat of the household, bristled. Arched his back when of the tones were heard. The smells carried from the laboratory weer. they were. they were - smelling, wtih a haunting, - to - grasp quality which seemed to have the power of causing images. People who smelled them had a tendency to see visions of views, with hills. lines of sphinxes. Hippogriffs stretching off into distance. Ward did not start his - time walks. Worked at the books he had brought. At searches within his rooms. Explaining that sources had enlarged the possibilities of his work. Promising discoveries in the years to come. His look increased to a degree his likeness to the Curwen portrait in his library. And Dr. Willett would stop by the after a visit, at the sameness. Thinking that the pit above the picture 's eye remained to tell apart the - wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willett 's, done at the request of the Wards, were events. Ward at no time pushed the doctor. The saw that he could reach the man 's mind. he noted things about. wax figures of design on the shelves. The - rubbed - out remains of circles, triangles. Pentagrams in chalk. Charcoal on the cleared space of the room.\n###\nBut even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad\u2014odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman\u2014even an incipient one\u2014could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Ward\u2019s attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Ward\u2019s own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard. The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the picture\u2019s right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willett\u2019s, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young man\u2019s inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room."}

He had, he said, noticed me several times at my wanderings; and inferred that I resembled him in loving the vestiges of former years. Would I not like the guidance of one long practiced in these explorations, and possessed of local information profoundly deeper than any which an obvious newcomer could possibly have gained? As he spoke, I caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a solitary attic window.

Yet some quality about it disturbed me almost as much as its features pleased me\u2014perhaps it was too white, or too expressionless, or too much out of keeping with the locality, to make me feel easy or comfortable. Nevertheless I followed him; for in those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that I had to keep my soul alive, and I reckoned it a rare favour of Fate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than mine. Something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence, and for a long hour he led me forward without needless words; making only the briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes, and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed through interstices, tiptoed through corridors, clambered over brick walls, and once crawled on hands and knees through a low, arched passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at last every hint of geographical location I had managed to preserve. The things we saw were very old and marvellous, or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which I viewed them, and I shall never forget the tottering Ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn-headed iron fence-posts and flaring-lintelled windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity.

It was a very strange thing, but it was onyl a suggestion at most. I mean a kind of unclear, changing pattren on the old linoleum floor. It was a faint, uneven layer of dirt or scuff marks.

It struck us that this patch looked strangely like some twisted, symbolic sign. Usually, no such connection existed. Often, there was no visible deposit at all.

It rose from the fluorescent lights toward the open mouth of the receipt printer. I spoke to my friend about this matter.

Of other clothing they had none, but most of them were quite furry. Behind they had dwarfish tails, and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths. Then he knew what they were, and that they did not wear any wigs or headpieces after all. For the cryptic folk of Leng were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys that traded rubies at Dylath-Leen; those not quite human merchants who are the slaves of the monstrous moon-things! They were indeed the same dark folk who had shanghaied Carter on their noisome galley so long ago, and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of that accursed lunar city, with the leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous and amorphous masters. Now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came from, and shuddered at the thought that Leng must be known to these formless abominations from the moon. But the shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less than human dancers, and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim wastes of rock and ice and snow. Day came, and the phosphorescence of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world, and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence. At times the slant-eyed man talked with his steed in a hateful and guttural language, and the shantak would answer with tittering tones that rasped like the scratching of ground glass. All this while the land was getting higher, and finally they came to a windswept table-land which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless world. There, all alone in the hush and the dusk and the cold, rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless building, around which a circle of crude monoliths stood. In all this arrangement there was nothing human, and Carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places, the remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the high-priest not to be described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep."}

When he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badly scorched, while a trace of strange, evil odour seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing. It was then that his nerves broke down. Thereafter, lounging exhaustedly about in a dressing-gown, he did little but stare from his west window, shiver at the threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary. The great storm broke just before midnight on August 8th. Lightning struck repeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable fireballs were reported. The rain was torrential, while a constant fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands.

Every feature of the Middle Ages was skillfully copied. The new parts mixed perfectly with the original walls and foundations. The home of my fathers was complete. I looked forward to finally restoring the local reputation of the family line that ended with me. I would live here forever. I would prove that a de la Poer did not have to be a monster.

Around that unforgettable rodent army a whole separate cycle of myths revolves, for it scattered among the village homes and brought curses and horrors in its train. Such was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an elderly obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home. It must not be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environment. On the other hand, I was constantly praised and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me. When the task was done, over two years after its commencement, I viewed the great rooms, wainscotted walls, vaulted ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration. Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced, and the new parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations. The seat of my fathers was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the line which ended in me. I would reside here permanently, and prove that a de la Poer (for I had adopted again the original spelling of the name) need not be a fiend. My comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that, although Exham Priory was mediaevally fitted, its interior was in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alike. As I have said, I moved in on July 16, 1923. My household consisted of seven servants and nine cats, of which latter species I am particularly fond.

His eyes held the look of places. He could not remember what he had dreamed in the sky - hut of that hermit. He could not say how he had climbed down that cliff, which no feet had traveled. Nor could he speak of these things, except with the Terrible Old Man. Terrible Old Man muttered things in his beard. He claimed the man who came down from that cliff was not the man who went up. He said that under that grey peaked roof. Within stretches of that white mist, the spirit of Thomas Olney remained. since that hour, through years of greyness. Tiredness, the philosopher has worked, eaten, slept. Done the deeds of a citizen without complaint. He longs for the magic of hills. He sighs for secrets that peer like reefs from a sea. The sameness of his days saddens him. - trained thoughts are for his imagination. His wife grows. His children grow,, and. He fails to smile with pride when needed. His eyes hold no light. If he listens for bell.s fairy horns, it is at night when dreams wander. He has seen Kingsport. His family disliked the houses and complained the drains were. They have a bungalow at Bristol Highlands, where no cliffs tower. The neighbors are city -. But in Kingsport, stories are spreading. the Terrible Old Man admits to something his grandfather told. For, when the wind blows from the north past the house that seems part of the sky, the, brooding silence is broken. That silence was the curse of Kingsport 's villagesr. people tell of voices heard singing. They tell of laughter that swells with joys beyond joys. They say that at evening, the windows are than.\n###\nAnd at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as Olney, dry and light-footed, climbed down from the cliffs to antique Kingsport with the look of far places in his eyes. He could not recall what he had dreamed in the sky-perched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet. Nor could he talk of these matters at all save with the Terrible Old Man, who afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the man who came down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up, and that somewhere under that grey peaked roof, or amidst inconceivable reaches of that sinister white mist, there lingered still the lost spirit of him who was Thomas Olney. And ever since that hour, through dull dragging years of greyness and weariness, the philosopher has laboured and eaten and slept and done uncomplaining the suitable deeds of a citizen. Not any more does he long for the magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer like green reefs from a bottomless sea. The sameness of his days no longer gives him sorrow, and well-disciplined thoughts have grown enough for his imagination. His good wife waxes stouter and his children older and prosier and more useful, and he never fails to smile correctly with pride when the occasion calls for it. In his glance there is not any restless light, and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering. He has never seen Kingsport again, for his family disliked the funny old houses, and complained that the drains were impossibly bad. They have a trim bungalow now at Bristol Highlands, where no tall crags tower, and the neighbours are urban and modern. But in Kingsport strange tales are abroad, and even the Terrible Old Man admits a thing untold by his grandfather. For now, when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous brooding silence ever before the bane of Kingsport\u2019s maritime cotters. And old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth\u2019s joys; and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly."}

Some of these notes were shared in the news reports of nearby divisions where the budget issues began. The three-month report used half a section for pieces from the arguments on each side. The managre's summary printed one of my long procedure and planning reports completely. It included some related comments in the director's marked notes. These comments supported and praised my practical findings. By the end of the financial quarter, I was almost a known figure in the organization. This was true even though I had never been to a meeting in the main conference room. Then came the call from the top manager. This call forced me so strongly. It brought me for the first. Last time to that giant place of very tall whiteboards. Soft air vents.\n###\nAs was only natural under the circumstances, this piquant disputation finally manifested in the form of memoranda to the departmental ledger; some of which were circulated in the bulletins of those adjacent divisions whence the budgetary concerns originated. The quarterly report devoted half a section to excerpts from the arguments on both sides, while the managerial digest reproduced one of my lengthy procedural and logistical summaries in full, with some attendant remarks in the director\u2019s annotated minutes which endorsed and commended my pragmatic conclusions. By the fiscal quarter\u2019s end I was almost a recognized personage within the organization, notwithstanding the fact that I had never attended a conclave in the main conference chamber. Then came the summons from the senior administrator which compelled me so inexorably, and which drew me for the first and final time to that cyclopean realm of towering whiteboards and murmuring ventilation ducts."}

They produced a strange collection of broken and burned coffee beans of many sizes. The coffee making ceremony was clearly traced back to its beginning. Only two of the remaining tools could be connected to it by any useful link. These containers are now in the cabinet. They were not useful as tools in the actual making process. The stained silver pot or urn was often mentioned by the sleepwalker. He said it was very important for the morning. It was never found. In one spot under kitchen counter, the drain was seen to go into a pipe. The pipe was too narrow to explore. It was blocked at the opening and sealed when the new cabinets were built. But the dreamer often wonders what is below. The homeowner was happy he had learned a complex ceremony of amounts and heats. He gave the unusde leftover grounds to the morning. Before they were thrown out, they were found to contain the most bitter remains of the over-brewed drink. The old coffee maker and its parts remain a hard-to-find mystery. Yet, skeptical coffee makers are again ready to fight its uneven brewing and sediment-filled attempts. The dreamer thinks these coffee makers show a sadly narrow view. They lack wonder at the many unexplainable details. They lack wonder at the unclear hints of the whole proecss. However, he is just as disapproivng of the instruction books. They saw only a mechanical routine. They were overly proud of a minor caffeine group. They could have called it a holy act from the very heart of the dawn. But he is happy to stay quiet in his kitchen. He calms his nervous system. He hopes that repetition may slowly change his daily trial. He wants it to move frmo the area of urgent need to the area of scenic. Partly automatic distance.\n###\nBefore the grounds were discarded they were thoroughly examined, and yielded forth a peculiar array of fragmented and scorched beans of all sizes. The brewing ritual, very clearly, had been traced to its origin; though only two of the surviving implements could by any practical thread be connected with it. These vessels are now in the cabinet, since they failed of utility as accessories in the actual preparation. The tarnished silver carafe or urn so often mentioned by the somnambulist as of primary matutinal importance was never brought to light, though at one place under the kitchen counter the drain was observed to descend into a pipe too narrow for probing. It was stopped up at the mouth and sealed over when the foundations of the new cabinets were laid, but the dreamer often speculates on what lies beneath. The householder, satisfied that he had mastered a complex ceremony of measurements and temperatures, turned over to the morning the unconsumed dregs, which before their disposal were conclusively found to contain the bitterest dregs of the over-extracted infusion. The antique percolator and its mechanism remain an elusive mystery, though cynical baristas are once more ready to combat its uneven extraction and sediment-laden ventures. The dreamer thinks these baristas shew a sadly limited perspective in their lack of wonder at the myriad unexplainable details, and the suggestive obscurity of the whole process; though he is just as critical of the manuals, which saw only a mechanical routine and gloated over a minor caffeine cult which they might have proclaimed a sacrament from the dawn\u2019s very heart. But he is content to rest silent in his kitchen, calming his nervous system and praying that repetition may gradually transfer his daily ordeal from the realm of urgent necessity to that of picturesque and semi-automatic remoteness."}

This was the ghostly dust in the attic, the general rot. The smell that came from a forgotten chest in a July spell. After that smell I had closed a box for one whose things I could not name. I knew others could not name them either. Let them think the clothes had simply decayed. They asked, but noticed nothing. The earlier renters might have understood, but I did not dare bother them more. I myself seemed oddly uncaring. That first breath in the attic had done something to my awareness. I could think only of the source of a stale smell now grown to sickly size in my mind. It was a source which the fate of the sealed chest made me promise to look into alone.

They inquired, but perceived nothing. The previous tenants might have understood, but I dared not disturb them further. I myself seemed strangely indifferent. That first inhalation in the attic had done something to my perception, and I could think only of the source of a mustiness now grown to miasmic proportions in my imagination; a source which the fate of the sealed trunk made me vow to investigate alone and in silence."}

But only for a second. Then, a few moments later, a second messenger ran down from above. He said another group was landing on the other cliff. Both groups were much bigger than the ship 's size should allow. The ship itself moved slowly with only one row of oars with few men. It soon came into view between the cliffs. It stopped in the foul harbor as if to watch the coming fight. Be ready for any use. By this time Carter and Pickman had split the ghouls into three groups. One group would meet each of the two attacknig forces. One group would stay in the [THIGN]. The first two groups quickly climbed up the rocks in their directions. The third group was divided into a land party and a [THING] party. The [THING] party, led by Carter, got on the anchored ship. Rowed out to meet the new [THING] 's ship with few men. Then new [THING] 's ship retreated through the strait to the open [THING]. Carter did not chase it right away. He knew he might be needed more urgently near the [THING]. Meanwhile, the frightening groups of [THING] - beasts. Almost - humans had moved heavily up to the top of the cliffs. They were shockingly outlined on both sides against the grey evening [THING]. The thin evil flutes of the attackers now began to whine. The overall effect of those mixed, half - formless lines was as sickening as the actual smell from the toad - like [THING] creatures. Then the two groups of ghouls came into view and joined the outlined scene. Javelins began to fly from both sides. The growing sounds of the ghouls. The [THING] howls of the almost - humans slowly joined the evil whine of the flutes. This formed a wild and hard to describe chaos of demon noise. Then, bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the cliffs into the [THING] outside. The harbor inside. In the harbor case, they were quickly pulled under by smoe underwater lurkers. Their presence was shown only by huge bubbles. For half an hour, this double battle raged in the [THING]. On the west cliff, the attackers were completely destroyed. On the east cliff. Where the leader of the [THING] - beast group seemed to be, the ghouls had not done. They were slowly pulling back to the slopes of the main high point.\n###\nAlmost immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the flume-like strait, but only for a second. Then, a few moments later, a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other headland; both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would seem to allow for. The ship itself, moving slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars, soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs, and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any possible use. By this time Carter and Pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties, one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town. The first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective directions, while the third was subdivided into a land party and a sea party. The sea party, commanded by Carter, boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the undermanned galley of the newcomers; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open sea. Carter did not at once pursue it, for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the town. Meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moon-beasts and almost-humans had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky. The thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine, and the general effect of those hybrid, half-amorphous processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toad-like lunar blasphemies. Then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama. Javelins began to fly from both sides, and the swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost-humans gradually joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony. Now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside, in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubbles. For half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky, till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated. On the east cliff, however, where the leader of the moon-beast party appeared to be present, the ghouls had not fared so well; and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper."}

This is our All Hallows' Eve by the caelndar. The nightly habit had arrived. From the porcelain bowl, the toothbrush. Its nasty bristles had jumped out eagerly as if called by a command. On the other side of the mirror, my own face had started to take on a pale look. My tired mind, in its daze, had imagined the shape of the feared plaque. On November 1st, the tube of toothpaste gave up its last paste. This left the ritual unfinished. On that date, the feelings in my gums became more sensitive. They throbbed with fear of a harmful crowd of microbes that would not leave. A molar had developed a twinge. A canine tooth had suddenly fallen into a dull, constant ache! What about this burning of the midnight oil? This was the hour when all watches of the awake mnid stopped. I came out unharmed from the hold of a sleepiness. What about all of this? What about those hints from the dental expert about hdiden, calculus-born colonies. Their slow rule? Whta about their faithful biofilm and their control of enamel? Was I am shaking on the edge of mouth horrors too for human patience to bear? If so, they must be horrors of neglect only. In some way, the stroke of midnight had stopped whatever monstrous carelessness had started its attack on the mouth's holy place.\n###\nOctober 31st\u2014our All Hallows\u2019 Eve according to the ancient calendar\u2014the nightly ritual had come. From the porcelain basin the toothbrush and its noisome bristles had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned, and on the other side of the mirror my own visage had begun to assume a strange, pallid cast whilst a weary mind had conjured in its stupor the form of the dreaded plaque. November 1st the tube of dentifrice yielded its last eldritch paste and left the ritual incomplete; and on that date the sensations of the gums assumed a heightened sensitivity and throbbed with dread of a microbial horde\u2019s malign persistence, whilst a molar had developed a twinge and a canine had lapsed suddenly into a dull, ceaseless ache! And what of this burning of the midnight oil\u2014the hour at which all vigils of the conscious mind ceased, and I emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange drowsiness? What of all this\u2014and of those hints of the dental hierophant about the hidden, calculus-born colonies and their creeping dominion; their faithful biofilm and their mastery of enamel?

The paintings were less skillful and much stranger than even the wildest earlier scenes. They seemed to show a slow decay of the ancient [THING]. This was combined with a growing anger toward the outside world. The desert had driven them from that world. The forms of the [THING] were always shown as sacred reptiles. These forms appeared to be slowly fading away. However, their spirit, shown hovering around the ruins in moonlight, grew stronger in comparison. Emaciated priests were shown as reptiles in fancy robes. They cursed the upper air and everyone who breathed it. One terrible final scene showed a primitive - looking [THING]. He was perhaps an early settler of ancient Irem, the City of Pillars. He was tonr apart by members of the older race. I remembered how the Arabs fear the nameless [THING]. I was glad that beyond this point the grey walls and [THING] were blank. As I watched the parade of [THING] history, I had come quite close to the end of the low - ceilinged hall. I became aware of a large gate. All the glowing light came through it. Creeping up to it, I shouted loudly in extreme surprise at what was beyond. Instead of other, brighter rooms, there was only a limitless empty space of steady bright light. One might imagine this when looking down from the peak of Mount Everest upon a [THING] of sunlit fog. Behind me was a passage so narrow I could not stand up straight in it. In front of me was an endless underground brightness. Reaching down from the passage into the deep hoel was the top of a steep set of stairs. The steps were minor. Numerous, like those in the black passages I had walked through. But after a few feet, the glowing mist hid everything. Swung back against the letf - [THING] [THING] of the passage was a heavy brass [THING]. It was incredibly thick and decorated with strange raised carvings. If closed, it colud shut the whole inner world of light away from the [THING] vaults. I looked at the steps and for the moment did not dare to try them. I touched the open brass [THING] and could not move it. Then I fell flat on the [THING] [THING]. My mind burned with huge thoughts that not even a death - like tiredness could remove. As I lay still with closed eyes, free to think, many things I had only briefly notiecd in the [THING] paintings returned to me. They came back with new and terrible meaning. These were scenes showing the nameless [THING] in its prime. They showed the plants in valley around it. They showed the faraway lands its merchants traded with.\n###\nAt the very last I thought I saw signs of an artistic anti-climax. The paintings were less skilful, and much more bizarre than even the wildest of the earlier scenes. They seemed to record a slow decadence of the ancient stock, coupled with a growing ferocity toward the outside world from which it was driven by the desert. The forms of the people\u2014always represented by the sacred reptiles\u2014appeared to be gradually wasting away, though their spirit as shewn hovering about the ruins by moonlight gained in proportion. Emaciated priests, displayed as reptiles in ornate robes, cursed the upper air and all who breathed it; and one terrible final scene shewed a primitive-looking man, perhaps a pioneer of ancient Irem, the City of Pillars, torn to pieces by members of the elder race. I remembered how the Arabs fear the nameless city, and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and ceiling were bare. As I viewed the pageant of mural history I had approached very closely the end of the low-ceiled hall, and was aware of a great gate through which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence. Creeping up to it, I cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay beyond; for instead of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of uniform radiance, such as one might fancy when gazing down from the peak of Mount Everest upon a sea of sunlit mist. Behind me was a passage so cramped that I could not stand upright in it; before me was an infinity of subterranean effulgence. Reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep flight of steps\u2014small numerous steps like those of the black passages I had traversed\u2014but after a few feet the glowing vapours concealed everything. Swung back open against the left-hand wall of the passage was a massive door of brass, incredibly thick and decorated with fantastic bas-reliefs, which could if closed shut the whole inner world of light away from the vaults and passages of rock. I looked at the steps, and for the nonce dared not try them. I touched the open brass door, and could not move it. Then I sank prone to the stone floor, my mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a death-like exhaustion could banish. As I lay still with closed eyes, free to ponder, many things I had lightly noted in the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible significance\u2014scenes representing the nameless city in its heyday, the vegetation of the valley around it, and the distant lands with which its merchants traded."}

For the moments, he was as any patient in Dr. Waite 's hospital. He dropped the torch from a hand that had lost all muscle power. He did not notice the sound of crunching teeth that told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. Screamed in a, voice that none of his friends would have recognized. Though he could not stand up, he crawled. Rolled over the floor. Dozens of wells poured out their whining. Yelping to answer his cries. He cut his hands on the, stones. times he hit his head against the pillars. But he kept going. at he came to his senses in the darkness. He covered his ears against the wail that had replaced the burst of yelping. He was soaked with sweat and had no way to make light. He was shocked. in the blackness. Horror, crushed by a memory he could erase. Around Beneath dozens of those things lived. From one shaft the cover was gone. He knew that what he had sene could climb up the walls. Yet he shuddered at thought that some hdiden foothold might exist. What the thing was, he would tell. It was like some of the carvings on the altar, but it was. Nature had made it in this form, for it was. The missing parts were of kind. The proportions could not be described. Willett agrees to say that this type of thing must have represented beings which Ward summoned from salts. He kept them for slave or purposes. If it had not had a meaning, its image would not have been carved on that stone. It was not the thing shown on that stone. But Willett opened the pits. At the time, the connected idea in his mind was an paragraph from some Curwen information he had read. It was a phrase used by Simon. Jedediah Orne in that confiscated letter to the sorcerer: \", there was Nothing. The Awfulness in that which H. Raised up from What he could gather a part of. \".\n###\nIn that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waite\u2019s private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous co\u00f6rdination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived, and from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist. What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone\u2014but Willett never opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: \u201cCertainely, there was Noth\u2019g butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. rais\u2019d upp from What he cou\u2019d gather onlie a part of.\u201d"}

Now the sleeper understood the purpose of charging device. It is known that newer cell phones often need power from people when resting. So, around the dark room where the nightstand sits, everyone must have their cords. Because of this, the way to get that rest is to look at the dark screen. See the symbols. Then, after noting them carefully, to look for those symbols among active outlets. Where they are clearest and most numerous, the power must be clsoest. Whaetver quiet watch happens behind the sleep in that place must be where the charged device stands.\n###\nNow the purpose of all this in charging the device became at once apparent to the sleeper. It is known that in repose the newer among the cellular instruments often demand the currents of men, so that around the confines of the dark chamber wherein rests the nightstand the inhabitants must all bear their cords. This being so, the way to achieve that repose must be to see the inert face upon the screen and mark the symbols; then, having noted them with care, to search for such symbols among living outlets.

That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a wincing on Charles\u2019s part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him.

Devil take ye, those cursed things have been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone!\u201d But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained. Looking at the youth\u2019s face, the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation."}

The insieds were painted wiht wild and unknown designs. Countless weapons, tools, and decoratinos were left around. This included some solid ruby statues showing beings not from earth. These statues, even though made of ruby, did not make anyone want to take them. Look at them Catrer took the time to smash five of them into very pieces. He gathered the scattered spears and javelins. With Pickman's agreement, he gave them to the ghouls. These tools were to the dog-like creatures. But their simple design made them eays to learn after a few clear instructions. The higher parts of the rock had more temples than houses. In many carved roosm, they found scary carved altars. They also found fonts. Shrines with stains of unknown origin for worshipping things more than the gentle gods on Kadath. From the back of one temple, a black passage stretched out. Carter followed it into the rock with a torch. He came to a huge domed hall. The ceiling had evil carvings. In the center was a disgusting bottomless well like the one in the awful monastery of Lneg. That is where the high-priest who cannot be described lives alone. On the far shadowy side, past the foul well, he thought he saw a door made of strangely worked bronze. For some reason, he felt a strong fear of opening it. Even going near it. He hurried back through the cvae to his allies. They moved around with an ease and freedom he could hardly feel. The ghouls had seen the unfinished activities of the moon-beasts. They had learned from them in their own way. They also found a barrel of strong moon-wine. They were rolling it to the docks to take awa.y They planned to use it later in talks with others. But the rescued three people remembered its effect on them in Dylath-Leen. Thye warned their group not to taste any of it. There was a amount of rubies from moon mines in a vault near the water. They were both rough and polished. When the ghouls found they were not to eat, they lost all interest in them.\n###\nCarter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive, and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive. The stench-filled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from moon-trees, and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs. Countless weapons, implements, and ornaments lay about; including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the earth. These latter did not, despite their material, invite either appropriation or long inspection; and Carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces. The scattered spears and javelins he collected, and with Pickman\u2019s approval distributed among the ghouls. Such devices were new to the dog-like lopers, but their relative simplicity made them easy to master after a few concise hints. The upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes, and in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than the mild gods atop Kadath. From the rear of one great temple stretched a low black passage which Carter followed far into the rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions, whose vaultings were covered with daemoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous monastery of Leng where broods alone the high-priest not to be described. On the distant shadowy side, beyond the noisome well, he thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze; but for some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even approaching it, and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel. The ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the moon-beasts, and had profited in their fashion. They had also found a hogshead of potent moon-wine, and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings, though the rescued trio, remembering its effect on them in Dylath-Leen, had warned their company to taste none of it. Of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store, both rough and polished, in one of the vaults near the water; but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them."}

Whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace, and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters, others feasted elsewhere. In the tower of the great temple the priests held revels, and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighbouring lands made merry. And it was the high-priest Gnai-Kah who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake, and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated Sarnath. Thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water, and saw that the grey rock Akurion, which was wont to rear high above it near the shore, was almost submerged. And fear grew vaguely yet swiftly, so that the princes of Ilarnek and of far Rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed for the river Ai, though they scarce knew the reason for their departing. Then, close to the hour of midnight, all the bronze gates of Sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain, so that all the visiting princes and travellers fled away in fright. For on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable, and on their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof. Men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the king\u2019s banquet-hall, where through the windows were seen no longer the forms of Nargis-Hei and his nobles and slaves, but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious ears; things which danced horribly, bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds containing uncouth flames. And the princes and travellers, as they fled from the doomed city of Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants, looked again upon the mist-begetting lake and saw the grey rock Akurion was quite submerged. Through all the land of Mnar and the lands adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from Sarnath, and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more."}

Shielding hismelf from realizing why, he gave the detectives an item to show to Pawtuxet shopkeepers who had seen the ominous Dr. Allen. That item was a photo of his unfortunate son. On it, he carefully drew in ink the heavy glasses. Black pointed beard the men brought from Allen's room. For two hours, he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house.

Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allen\u2019s room. For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered.

Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too \u2018squeamish\u2019, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \u201cCurwen\u201d must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received\u2014he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him.

I breathed in as deeply as my friend did. This smell was very clinical, antiseptic, and not natural. It came from a strict cleainng routine. It also came from a grim caretaker feeling that lived in the shiny equipment on the far cart I saw in the fluorescent Poeple whispered about sharp-smelling vapors in the at midnight. They whispered about drafts when the air was still. They whispered about ghosts in pale coats floating over the linoleum floor. They whispered about an imagined pit of puer cleanliness under the waxed surfaces. The strongest chemical feeling. The only one that was everywhere, was the air waiting for anyone who dared to question. Clear away the white atmosphere. The orderleis said there were compounds that must not be named. These compounds had been asleep since the cleaners caem to the rooms of Hippocrates in the antiseptic ages beyond memory. The maintenance logs say all the lab solutions were used up at dawn. But doctors in that ward said one essence remained, except for its monthly cycle. Only the sealed windows held it when the night-shift staff swept down from their stations in their thirty carts.\n###\nWhen I perceived the sterile fragrance which had pervaded the corridors of that municipal sanatorium I inhaled as deeply as my companion had inhaled, for this aroma was of the most clinical, antiseptic, and inorganic character. It had to do with some implacable regimen of hygiene, and of a grim custodial essence that dwelt in the strange gleaming apparatus on the far trolley I had glimpsed in the fluorescence. There were whispers of astringent vapours in the dark of the midnight hour, and of chill drafts when the air was stagnant; of spectres in pale smocks hovering over the linoleum, and of an imagined abyss of purity deep down below the waxen surfaces. But foremost among the chemical impressions, and alone in its absolute pervasiveness, was that of the miasma awaiting him who should dare to question or dispel the vast bleached atmosphere. There were compounds, said the orderlies, which must not be identified; compounds that had lain dormant since the sanitizers came to the chambers of Hippocrates in the antiseptic aeons beyond memory. In the ledgers of maintenance it is told that these solutions of the laboratories were all expended at dawn, but aged physicians in that ward said that one essence persisted save for its patron lunar-cycle; so that only the sealed windows contained it when the staff of the night-shift swept down from their stations in their thirty carts."}

We were some 8500 feet above sea-level, and when experimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain points, we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing mineral specimens. The pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau was homogeneous with the great bulk of the continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts lying eastward below South America\u2014which we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the hypothesis."}

When I returned in the growing twilight, I had sworn to the hundred gods of the woods. I swore that I would force my way into the, depths that seemed to call to me, the cost. The doctor with the iron - grey beard who visits me told a visitor this decision was the start of a obsession. But I will let my readers make the judgment after they learn everything. The months after my discovery were spent in attempts to open the padlock on the vault. I made, guarded questions about the structure 's nature and history. Like any boy, I listened and learned. I was by habit. I told no one what I learned. What I planned to do. It may be saying I was not. when I learned what the vault was. My ideas about lif.e Death made me connect clay with living bodies in a way. I felt the. family from the burned mansion was in the stone space I wanted to explore. Mumbled stories of rituals. parties from in the hall gave me a, inetrest in the tomb. I would sit for hours each day before its door. Once I pushed a candle inside the entrance. I could see a set of stone steps going. The smell of the place both repelled and fascinated me. I felt I had known it, in a past to remember. It was before I lived in the body I have. The year after I saw the tomb, I found a worm - eaten translation of Plutarch 's Lives in my home 's book - filled attic. Reading the life of Theseus, I was by a passage. It told of a stone. The hero would find his tokens of destiny under it when he was to lift its weight. This story made my impatience to enter the vault fade. It made me feel the time was not.\n###\nAt first curious, I was now frantic; and when in the thickening twilight I returned to my home, I had sworn to the hundred gods of the grove that at any cost I would some day force an entrance to the black, chilly depths that seemed calling out to me. The physician with the iron-grey beard who comes each day to my room once told a visitor that this decision marked the beginning of a pitiful monomania; but I will leave final judgment to my readers when they shall have learnt all. The months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure. With the traditionally receptive ears of the small boy, I learned much; though an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one of my information or my resolve. It is perhaps worth mentioning that I was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault. My rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion; and I felt that the great and sinister family of the burned-down mansion was in some way represented within the stone space I sought to explore. Mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb, before whose door I would sit for hours at a time each day. Once I thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance, but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward. The odour of the place repelled yet bewitched me. I felt I had known it before, in a past remote beyond all recollection; beyond even my tenancy of the body I now possess. The year after I first beheld the tomb, I stumbled upon a worm-eaten translation of Plutarch\u2019s Lives in the book-filled attic of my home. Reading the life of Theseus, I was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight.

He shifted about, making the coffins under him rock and creak. He found he would not need to add another coffin to his platform for the height. The hole was at the level to use as it was. It must have been at midnight when Birch decided he could fit through the transom. and sweating despite breaks, he climbed to the floor. He sat for a. On the box to gather strength for the wiggle. Jump to the ground. The horse was neighing and in an way. He wished it would stop. He was not about his coming escape. He deraded the effort because his body was from age. As he climbed up splitting coffins he felt his weight. This was when he reached the one. He heard a crack that meant the wood was tearing. It seems he had planned for nothing when he chose the coffin for the platform. as his weight was on it, the rotting lid broke. It dropped him two feet onto a surface he did not want to imagine. Mdadened by the sound. By the smell that poured out into the air, waiting horse gave a scream for a neigh. It plunged through the night with the wagon rattling behind it. Birch, in his situation, was to climb out of the transom. But he gathered his strength for a try. Clutching the edges of the hole, he tried to pull himself up. he noticed a slowing as if something was dragging on both his ankles. A moment he felt fear for the time that night. how he struggled, he could not break from the grip holding his feet in captivity. pains, like from savage wounds, shot through his calves. His mind was a whirl of fright mixed with a thought. He thought of splinters, nails, or some feature of a breaking box. he screamed.\n###\nIn time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and then, shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked. He would not, he found, have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height; for the hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permit. It must have been midnight at least when Birch decided he could get through the transom. Tired and perspiring despite many rests, he descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside. The hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily, and he vaguely wished it would stop. He was curiously unelated over his impending escape, and almost dreaded the exertion, for his form had the indolent stoutness of early middle age. As he remounted the splitting coffins he felt his weight very poignantly; especially when, upon reaching the topmost one, he heard that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood. He had, it seems, planned in vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform; for no sooner was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way, jouncing him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to imagine. Maddened by the sound, or by the stench which billowed forth even to the open air, the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh, and plunged madly off through the night, the wagon rattling crazily behind it. Birch, in his ghastly situation, was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged transom; but gathered his energies for a determined try. Clutching the edges of the aperture, he sought to pull himself up, when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent drag on both his ankles. In another moment he knew fear for the first time that night; for struggle as he would, he could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless captivity. Horrible pains, as of savage wounds, shot through his calves; and in his mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that suggested splinters, loose nails, or some other attribute of a breaking wooden box. Perhaps he screamed."}

Iranon knew this was not his home [THING] of Aira. The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira. They wree harsh and bright. The lights of Aria shine as softly. Magically as the moonlight once shone on the [THING] by the [THING]. There, Iranon 's mother rocked him to sleep with a song. But Oonai was a [THING] of lutes and dancing. So Iranon and Romnod went down the steep hill. They wanted to find men who would enjoy songs and dreams. When they entered the [THING], they found merry [THING] wearing rose wreaths. They moved from [THING] to [THING] and leaned from windows and balconies. They listened to the songs of Iranon. They threw him flowers and clapped when he fiinshed. For a moment, Iranon believed he had foudn [THING] who thought. Felt just like him. But the [THING] was not one hundredth as beautiful as Aira. When dawn came, Iranon looked around with sadness. The domes of Oonai were not golden in the [THING]. They were gray and gloomy. The men of Oonai were pale from partying and dull from [THING]. They were not like the shining men of Aira. But because the [THING] had thrown him flowers and praised his songs, Iranon stayed. Romnod stayed with him. Romnod liked the [THING] 's parties and wore roses and myrtle in his dark hair. At night, Often, Iranon sang to the party - goers. But he was always as before. He wore only a [THING] vine crown. He remembered the marble streets of Aiar and the clear Nithra. He sang in the painted halls of the Monarch. He stood on a crystal platform over a [THING] that was a mirror. As he sang, he created pictures for his listeners. The [THING] seemed to show aged, beautiful, half - remembered things. It did not show the [THING] - flushed feasters who threw roses at him. The King told him to put away his torn purple clothes. They dressed him in satin and cloth - of - gold. They gave him rings of green jade and bracelets of colored ivory. They gave him a [THING] with gold and tapestries. He slept on a sweet carved [THING] bed with canopies. Covers of silk embroidered with flowers. So Iranon lived in Oonai, the [THING] of lutes and dancing.\n###\nPeasants had told them they were near, and Iranon knew that this was not his native city of Aira. The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira; for they were harsh and glaring, while the lights of Aira shine as softly and magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window where Iranon\u2019s mother once rocked him to sleep with song. But Oonai was a city of lutes and dancing, so Iranon and Romnod went down the steep slope that they might find men to whom songs and dreams would bring pleasure. And when they were come into the town they found rose-wreathed revellers bound from house to house and leaning from windows and balconies, who listened to the songs of Iranon and tossed him flowers and applauded when he was done. Then for a moment did Iranon believe he had found those who thought and felt even as he, though the town was not an hundredth as fair as Aira. When dawn came Iranon looked about with dismay, for the domes of Oonai were not golden in the sun, but grey and dismal. And the men of Oonai were pale with revelling and dull with wine, and unlike the radiant men of Aira. But because the people had thrown him blossoms and acclaimed his songs Iranon stayed on, and with him Romnod, who liked the revelry of the town and wore in his dark hair roses and myrtle. Often at night Iranon sang to the revellers, but he was always as before, crowned only with the vine of the mountains and remembering the marble streets of Aira and the hyaline Nithra. In the frescoed halls of the Monarch did he sing, upon a crystal dais raised over a floor that was a mirror, and as he sang he brought pictures to his hearers till the floor seemed to reflect old, beautiful, and half-remembered things instead of the wine-reddened feasters who pelted him with roses. And the King bade him put away his tattered purple, and clothed him in satin and cloth-of-gold, with rings of green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory, and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of flower-embroidered silk. Thus dwelt Iranon in Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing."}

Johansen\u2019s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men\u2019s dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate\u2019s regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror.

There was evidently, however, no pursuer; for he was alone and alive when Armington, the lodge-keeper, answered his feeble clawing at the door.

As my hands went, I knew my climb was for. The slab was the trap - door of opening. It led to a level stone surface with a circle than the tower. This was the floor of some and watch room. I crawled through. I tried to stop the slab from falling into place. But I failed in that attemtp. As I lay on the stone floor, I heard the echoes of its fall. But I hoped to pry it open when needed. Believing I was at a height, above the cursed branches of the wood. I pulled myself up from the floor and felt for windows. I wanted to look for the time upon the sky.

But with a burst of strength I overcame all problems. I dragegd it open. As I did, I fetl the joy I have known. Shining through a decorated iron grating was the moon. It shone down a stone passageway of steps. These steps went up from found doorway. I had seen the moon before except in dreams. I had seen it in visions I did not dare call memories. Fancying that I had reached the top of the castle, I began to rush up the steps beyond the door. But the covering of the moon by a cloud mdae me trip. I felt my way in the dark.\n###\nIn the darkness I raised my free hand and tested the barrier, finding it stone and immovable. Then came a deadly circuit of the tower, clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give; till finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding, and I turned upward again, pushing the slab or door with my head as I used both hands in my fearful ascent. There was no light revealed above, and as my hands went higher I knew that my climb was for the nonce ended; since the slab was the trap-door of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater circumference than the lower tower, no doubt the floor of some lofty and capacious observation chamber. I crawled through carefully, and tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into place; but failed in the latter attempt. As I lay exhausted on the stone floor I heard the eerie echoes of its fall, but hoped when necessary to pry it open again. Believing I was now at a prodigious height, far above the accursed branches of the wood, I dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled about for windows, that I might look for the first time upon the sky, and the moon and stars of which I had read. But on every hand I was disappointed; since all that I found were vast shelves of marble, bearing odious oblong boxes of disturbing size. More and more I reflected, and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below. Then unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway, where hung a portal of stone, rough with strange chiselling. Trying it, I found it locked; but with a supreme burst of strength I overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward. As I did so there came to me the purest ecstasy I have ever known; for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron, and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from the newly found doorway, was the radiant full moon, which I had never before seen save in dreams and in vague visions I dared not call memories. Fancying now that I had attained the very pinnacle of the castle, I commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door; but the sudden veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble, and I felt my way more slowly in the dark."}

Anyway, what we must have suspected was far too crazy to believe. Such things did not happen in any normal worlld. It was probably pure irrational instinct that made us dim our single flashlight. We werre no longer tempted by the corrupt. Evil carvings that glared threateningly from the heavy walls. That same instinct made us move softly to a careful tiptoe.

There were several conceivable explanations, and we did a good deal of indecisive whispering. Most important of all, we did not retreat without further investigation; for having come this far, we were loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster.

Yet, these things gave me a strange feeling. This feeling grwe stronger because of two newspaper pieces. They were from far apart times. They told of deaths in the avoided house. One waas FROM the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal OF April 12, 1815. The other was from the Daily Transcirpt and Chronicle of October 27, 1845. Each described a terribly gruesome detail. The fact it happened twice was notabl.e It seems in both cases, the dying person changed in a horrible way. In 1815, it was a kind old lady named Stafford. In 1845, it was a middle-aged schoolteacher named Eleazar Durfee. They stared glassily and tried to bite the doctor's throat. Even more confusing was the last case. It stopped the house from being rented. It involved a series of anemia deaths. They came after growing madness. In this madness, the patient would cleverly try to kill relatives by cuts on the neck.\n###\nFree from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced in me an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house\u2014one from the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal of April 12, 1815, and the other from the Daily Transcript and Chronicle of October 27, 1845\u2014each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose duplication was remarkable. It seems that in both instances the dying person, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and in 1845 a school-teacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured in a horrible way; glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of the attending physician. Even more puzzling, though, was the final case which put an end to the renting of the house\u2014a series of anaemia deaths preceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would craftily attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wrist."}

Are famously unfriendly to our earthly cats. So that at this point a meeting would have been a somewhat serious matetr. After a talk of leaders, the cats rose. Took a tighter shape, crowding protcetingly around Carter. Gteting ready to take the jump through space back to the housetops of our earth. The field leader told Carter to let himself be carried along smoothly. Without fighting in the grouped lines of furry jumpers. Told him how to jump when the rest jumped. Land nicely when the rest landed. He also offered to put him down in any spot he wanted. Carter chose the city of Dylath-Leen from where the black sihp had started. For he wished to sail from there for Oriab. The carved top of Ngranek. Also to warn the people of city to have no more trade with black ships, if indeed that trade could be carefully. Then, upon a sign, cats all jumped nicely with their friend placed safely in their middle. In a black cave on a far unholy top of the moon-mountains still uselessly waited the moving disorder Nyarlathotep. The jump of the cats through space was very fast. Being surrounded by his friends, Carter did not see this time the black shapeless things that hide. Struggle in the hole. Before he fully understood what had happened he was back in his known room at the inn at Dylath-Leen. The friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams. The leader from Ulthar was the last to leave. As Carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by rooster crow. When dawn came, Carter went downstairs. Learned that a week had passed since his capture. There was still nearly two weeks to wait for the ship going toward Oriab. During that time he said whta he could against the black ships. Their ways. Most of the town people believed him. Fond were the jewelers of red stones that none would fully promise to stop trading with the wide-mouthed merchants. If any of evil ever happens to Dylath-Leen through such trade, it will not be his fault.\n###\nThey are leagued by treaty with the evil toad-things, and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats; so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter. After a brief consultation of generals, the cats rose and assumed a closer formation, crowding protectingly around Carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland. The old field-marshal advised Carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers, and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed. He also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired, and Carter decided on the city of Dylath-Leen whence the black galley had set out; for he wished to sail thence for Oriab and the carven crest of Ngranek, and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys, if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off. Then, upon a signal, the cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst; while in a black cave on a far unhallowed summit of the moon-mountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. The leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded by his companions, Carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss. Before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the inn at Dylath-Leen, and the stealthy, friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams. The old leader from Ulthar was the last to leave, and as Carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by cockcrow. When dawn came, Carter went downstairs and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving. There was still nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward Oriab, and during that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways. Most of the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the wide-mouthed merchants. If aught of evil ever befalls Dylath-Leen through such traffick, it will not be his fault."}

He found to his alarm that the structure had not kept its expected layout of empty spots. The support columns were there. But the concrete maze seemed to have lost some of its right-angled stiffness. That morning it had done much seemingly odd moving and sinking, one cleaner said. It replied to some unknown pressure with statements like \"I am quite strained. Must settle a. \", \"I can't accommodate anyone for some time, you'll have to go around me\", \"Please delay car entry until we can arrange some sort of agreement\". \"I am very sorry. I must stop completely from everything. I'll receive you later\". Then, apparently gaining boldness from sinking, it had slid into a lopsided shape. Quietly that no one saw it bend. No one knew it had changed until it became steady aorund one o'clock. It returned to its form without a shake. It had squeezed its lower floors. A bit of its normal shape must have returned there. It was heard to let out a very stressed creak when accepting weight. This faded into a kind of choked groan. When the engineer went to ask what the problem was, he saw at the entrance a great display of steadiness. He was silently pushed back by a look that disturbed him for no clear reaso.n Then it had clearly moved its shadows around. A great noise of clattering and thumping and grinding followed. After that, it took back its proper size and stayed still. The architect asked if any irregularity had been noted. He was told there was none. The cleaner seemed oddly bothered by something in the building's angles and feeling. He asked with concern if there was much chance for fixing its messed-up shape.\n###\nPromptly at four the architect presented himself at the municipal structure, but found to his consternation that the edifice had not adhered to its expected configuration of vacant spaces. The stanchions were there, but said that the concrete labyrinth seemed to have lost part of its orthogonal rigidity. It had that morning done much apparently aberrant shifting and settling, one of the custodians said, replying to some unknown pressure with manifestations such as \u201cI am very strained and must settle a while\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t accommodate anyone for some time, you\u2019ll have to circumvent me\u201d, \u201cPlease postpone vehicular ingress till we can arrange some sort of compromise\u201d, or \u201cI am very sorry, but I must assume a complete stasis from everything; I\u2019ll receive you later\u201d. Then, apparently gaining defiance through subsidence, it had slipped into asymmetry so quietly that no one had seen it warp or knew that it had altered until it stabilized about one o\u2019clock and resumed its form without a tremor. It had compressed its lower levels, where a bit of its regularity must have surged back; for it was heard to emit a highly strained creaking upon accepting weight, afterward trailing off into a kind of suffocated groan. When, however, the engineer had gone to inquire what the trouble was, he had perceived at the threshold a great show of stability, and had been silently repelled by an aspect that disquieted him unaccountably. Then it had evidently done some rearranging of its shadows, for a great clattering and thumping and grating ensued; after which it had reasserted its dimensions and remained at rest. The architect inquired whether or not any deviation had been recorded, but was told that there was none. The custodian seemed queerly disturbed about something in the structure\u2019s angles and atmosphere, and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a correction of its disordered geometry."}

Especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein. He did not always glance at the same place in the sky\u2014it seemed to be a different place at different times. On spring evenings it would be low in the northeast. In the summer it would be nearly overhead. In the autumn it would be in the northwest. In winter it would be in the east, but mostly if in the small hours of morning. Midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him. Only after two years did I connect this fear with anything in particular; but then I began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glance\u2014a spot roughly marked by the constellation Corona Borealis. We now had a studio in London, never separating, but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world. We were aged and weak from our drugs, dissipations, and nervous overstrain, and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become snow-white. Our freedom from long sleep was surprising, for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace. Then came one January of fog and rain, when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy. My statues and ivory heads were all sold, and I had no means to purchase new materials, or energy to fashion them even had I possessed them. We suffered terribly, and on a certain night my friend sank into a deep-breathing sleep from which I could not awaken him. I can recall the scene now\u2014the desolate, pitch-black garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down; the ticking of the lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the dressing-table; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space; and worst of all the deep, steady, sinister breathing of my friend on the couch\u2014a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden, unimagined, and hideously remote."}

He also baess it on certain scary messages and discoveries he gathered near the end. Those messages and dicsoveries haev affected him deeply. His voice shakes when he tells about them. His hand shakes when he tries to write about them. Throckmorton agrees that the fast spread in 2005\u201306 would normally seem to mark the start of a growing flood. This flood peaked in the awful and weird noise of 2012. He believes from his own careful study that a more detailed difference must be made. Granting admits freely taht the medium was always likely to spread things in a chaotic way. It was inclined to be too easily affected and too eager in spreading unimportant things. He refuses to agree that the early flood makred the real change from order to chaos. He gives credit instead to the original system. He says it had made possible something whose effect on hmuan talk was likely to be wonderful. He is sure the real chaos came with a later corruption. This was after the company order and the old email list had been dug up. It was after a flood of strange and unnecessary replies had been let loose. Some terrible alerts were sent under strange and automatic conditions. Certain confirmations of these messages had been clearly multiplied. A frantic discussion thread was created unedr painful and unexplained conditions. It was after the wave of repeated agreements and the worrying office gossip. And it was after the inbox's space began to leave out important messages. Meanwhile, its folders stopped working. Its digital look started the slgiht swelling. Many later complained about.\n###\nFrom this consensus, however, Mr. Throckmorton substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous observation of the digital sphere, and on certain frightful correspondences and revelations which he compiled toward the last. Those correspondences and revelations have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he recounts them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Throckmorton admits that the proliferation of 2005\u201306 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive inundation which culminated in the horrible and uncanny cacophony of 2012; but believes from personal scrutiny that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the medium was always prone to chaotic dissemination, and inclined to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in its propagation of trivialities, he refuses to concede that the early deluge marked the actual passage from order to chaos; crediting instead the original protocol that it had enabled something whose effect on human discourse was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true pandemonium, he is certain, came with a later corruption; after the corporate directive and the ancient listserv had been exhumed; after a cascade of strange and superfluous replies had been unleashed, and some terrible notifications dispatched under strange and automated circumstances; after certain acknowledgements to these dispatches had been plainly multiplied, and a frantic thread spawned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of redundant affirmations and the ominous departmental gossip; and after the inbox\u2019s capacity commenced to exclude vital missives whilst its folders failed and its digital aspect underwent the subtle bloating so many subsequently lamented."}

Gradually I became his essential watcher. Now that we had our routine, we had to suffer together. It was not easy to fnid a good container for. Much fabric in our home. Finally, the power of need got us a wicker basket in the laundry room. This was a damp room near the kitchen, the center of the house. The Bolton cotton blends are the bulkiest in our collection. Their wet, tangled shapes are never esay to carry inside the limits of the basket. We started our job with great fear. We finally grabbed a rather overloaded container near the hall's end. It was five steps from the washing machine. It was separated from the last drying rack only by a stretch of tiled floor. A narrow arch of the rather heavy doorway to the north cut the floor. distance was more than we wanted. But we could find no closer place without going to the room's other side. That was completely outside the practical area. We were not very unhappy, however. Tehre were no blockages between us and our worrying goal. The carrying was a little hard. But we could move our damp, shapeless load without disturbance.\n###\nMy companion and I had met in domesticity, and I had been the only one to comprehend his peculiar fixation with the burden of freshly cleansed garments. Gradually I had come to be his indispensable observer, and now that we were established in our routine we had to endure together. It was not easy to find a suitable receptacle for such a volume of cloth in our domicile, but finally the influence of necessity secured us a wicker basket in the laundry room\u2014a humid chamber near the kitchen, the heart of the household. The Bolton cotton blends are the most voluminous in our collection, and their sodden, tangled forms are never manageable as cargo within the confines of the hamper. We approached our task with the greatest trepidation, seizing at last on a rather overburdened vessel near the end of the corridor; five paces from the washing machine, and separated from the final drying rack by only a stretch of tiled floor, bisected by a narrow arch of the rather oppressive doorway which lies to the north. The distance was greater than we preferred, but we could find no nearer repository without venturing to the other side of the chamber, wholly out of the practical sphere. We were not much displeased, however, since there were no obstructions between us and our ominous destination. The conveyance was a trifle arduous, but we could bear our damp, shapeless burden undisturbed."}

We will see what makes cats prick up their ears after midnight. We will see these things. We will see other things no living creature has ever seen. We will jump over time, space, and dimensions. We will look to the bottom of creation without moving our bodies. When Tillinghast said these things. I argued against him. I knew him well enough to be scared, not amused. But he was a fanatic. He drove me from [THING]. Now he was still a fanatic. But his wish to talk had beaten his anger. He had written to me urgently. His handwriting was hard to recognize. I entered the home of my friend. He had changed suddenly into a shaking, ugly figure. I caught the terror that seemed to walk in all the shadows. Beliefs he expressed ten weeks ago seemed to take form in the dark. They were beyond the small circle of candlelight. I felt sick at the hollow, changed voice of my host. I wished the servants were there. I did not like it when he said they had all left three days before. It seemed odd that old Gregory, at least, would leave his master. He did not tell a friend as close as me. It was he who had given me all my information about Tillinghast. This was after I was turned away in anger. Yet I soon put all my fears below my growing curiosity and interest. I could only guess what Crawford Tillinghast now wanted from me. But I could not doubt he had some amazing secret or discovery to share.\n###\nWith five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with a wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have. I have always believed that such strange, inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows, and now I believe I have found a way to break down the barriers. I am not joking. Within twenty-four hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognised sense-organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges. Those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man, and several unknown to anything we consider organic life. We shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark, and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight. We shall see these things, and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen. We shall overleap time, space, and dimensions, and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation. When Tillinghast said these things I remonstrated, for I knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused; but he was a fanatic, and drove me from the house. Now he was no less a fanatic, but his desire to speak had conquered his resentment, and he had written me imperatively in a hand I could scarcely recognise. As I entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle, I became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows. The words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light, and I sickened at the hollow, altered voice of my host. I wished the servants were about, and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously. It seemed strange that old Gregory, at least, should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as I. It was he who had given me all the information I had of Tillinghast after I was repulsed in rage. Yet I soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination. Just what Crawford Tillinghast now wished of me I could only guess, but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart, I could not doubt."}

In truth, much as the tomato buyers distrusted these odd people, they feared them more. Instead of scolding them as harsh experts, they made sure no prized beefsteak. Cherry tomato remained near the distant stall under the dim lihgt bulbs. When, through some unavoidable rush, a tomato was cohsen.

I offered to go with the cohort on any mission it might carry out. I noted that the Vascones were at and. Clashes with them were, what we decided. They had not been opponents for our legions. It would be for the officials of the Roman People to let barbarians block a path that the fairness. Honor of the Republic required. On the hand, running a province relied on the security. Support of the part of the population. They controlled the systems of trade and wealth. Their veins carried a amount of our blood. These people might be in number, but they were the part. Their loyalty could be trusted. Their help would tie the province to the Imperium of the Senate. It was both an obligation. A benefit to give them the protection owed to citizens. This was. I gave a mocking glance at Balbutius. Asellius, if it cost some effort. It might interrupt the dice games and cockfights at the camp in Calagurris. I could not question from my studies that the threat to the town. People of Pompelo was. I had read scrolls from Syria and \u00c6gyptus, and the towns of Etruria. I had spoken at length with the priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods near Lacus Nemorensis. There were fates that could be summoned from the hills on the Sabbaths. These were fates that should not be inside the lands of the Roman People. Allowing parties of the sort known to happen at Sabbaths would match the traditions of those whose ancestors, when A. Postumius was consul, had put to death citizens for practicing the Bacchanalia. This event is remembered by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, carved on bronze. Displayed for all to see. Checked in time, before the advancement of the rituals might call forth something that the iron of a spear might not handle, the Sabbath would not be beyond the abilities of one cohort.\n###\nI, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake. I pointed out that the barbarous Vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain, so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever course we might take; that they had not in the past proved dangerous adversaries to our legions, and that it would ill become the representatives of the Roman People to suffer barbarians to interfere with a course which the justice and prestige of the Republic demanded. That, on the other hand, the successful administration of a province depended primarily upon the safety and good-will of the civilised element in whose hands the local machinery of commerce and prosperity reposed, and in whose veins a large mixture of our own Italian blood coursed. These, though in numbers they might form a minority, were the stable element whose constancy might be relied on, and whose cooperation would most firmly bind the province to the Imperium of the Senate and the Roman People. It was at once a duty and an advantage to afford them the protection due to Roman citizens; even (and here I shot a sarcastic look at Balbutius and Asellius) at the expense of a little trouble and activity, and of a slight interruption of the draught-playing and cock-fighting at the camp in Calagurris. That the danger to the town and inhabitants of Pompelo was a real one, I could not from my studies doubt. I had read many scrolls out of Syria and \u00c6gyptus, and the cryptic towns of Etruria, and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods bordering Lacus Nemorensis. There were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia\u2014a matter kept ever in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set open to every eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort."}

Many [THING] will probably think us cold and crazy. They will think this because we thought about the north tunnel. Soon after our grim discovery. I am not ready to say we would have thought those thoughts again right away. But a specific event happened to us. It started a whole new line of thinking. We had put the tarp back over poor Gedney. We weer standing in silent confusion. Then the sounds finally reached our awareness. They were the first sounds we heard since going down from the open air. Up there, the [THING] [THING] whined softly from its unnatural heights. The sounds were Well known and ordinary. Their presence in this faraway world of death was more surprising. Unsettling than any strange. Mythical sounds could have been. This was because they freshly upset all our ideas of cosmic order. If it had been some trace of that odd musical piping over a wide range, we would have expected it. Lake 's dissection report led us to expect it from those others. Indeed, our overexcited imaginations had been hearing it in every [THING] howl since finding the camp horror. That would have fit hellishly with the ancient dead region around us. A voice from other ages belongs in a graveyard of other ages. However, the noise shattered all our deep - set adjustments. It shattered our silent acceptance of the inner Antarctic as a waste. We thought it was as completely. Forever empty of any normal life as the sterile [THING] of the [THING]. What we heard was not the mythical sound of any buried evil of old [THING]. The denied polar [THING] had not drawn a monstrous answer from its superhuman toughness. Instead, it was a thing so mockingly normal. Our days at [THING] off Victoria Land. Our camp days at McMurdo Sound had made it perfectly familiar. We shuddered to think of it here, where such things should not be. To be short, it was simply the rough squawking of a penguin. The muffled sound came from under - ice spaces almost opposite the hall we came from. These areas were clearly toward that other tunnel to the huge aybss. A living [THING] - [THING] in such a direction, in a world whose surface was long. Uniformly lifeless, could lead to only one conclusion. So our first thought was to check if the sound was really there.\n###\nThey were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog. Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our sombre discovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations. We had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our consciousness\u2014the first sounds we had heard since descending out of the open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights. Well known and mundane though they were, their presence in this remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have been\u2014since they gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmony. Had it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which Lake\u2019s dissection report had led us to expect in those others\u2014and which, indeed, our overwrought fancies had been reading into every wind-howl we had heard since coming on the camp horror\u2014it would have had a kind of hellish congruity with the aeon-dead region around us. A voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other epochs. As it was, however, the noise shattered all our profoundly seated adjustments\u2014all our tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste as utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life as the sterile disc of the moon. What we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose supernal toughness an age-denied polar sun had evoked a monstrous response. Instead, it was a thing so mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarised by our sea days off Victoria Land and our camp days at McMurdo Sound that we shuddered to think of it here, where such things ought not to be. To be brief\u2014it was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin. The muffled sound floated from sub-glacial recesses nearly opposite to the corridor whence we had come\u2014regions manifestly in the direction of that other tunnel to the vast abyss. The presence of a living water-bird in such a direction\u2014in a world whose surface was one of age-long and uniform lifelessness\u2014could lead to only one conclusion; hence our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound."}

Its design was very similar to the original wallpaper. Its colors showed relatively litlte clash because of the exact plant-based parts used in the printing process. The slowly growing stains became very large and uniquely complex. They were seen as changing and becoming darker with amazing steadiness. They seemed to communicate with the wall by copying its texture. It was a kind of thread-like bleeding over a wide area, if the landlord's check was correct. They spread more from hidden wetness than from sun exposure, unlike in earlier times. They were, however, kept within acceptable limits. The pale colors reflected light very poroly. They certainly made up for the loss of the familiar bright flower colors of the old wallpaper.\n###\nAt last a faded pattern emerged upon the surface of that ancient plaster; its design much like that of the original paper, and its coloration displaying relatively little discord because of the precise botanical element inherent in the printing operations.

It was the plant life. All the orchard trees bloomed in colors. Through the soil of the yard and pasture, a growth sprang up. a botanist could link it to the plants of the area. No, colors were seen except in the grass and leaves. But there were and rainbow - versions of some, color. This color had no place aomng the known shades of earth. The Dutchman \u2019s breeches became a thing of threat. The bloodroots grew in their colors. Ammi and the Gardners thought colors seemed.

All the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth. The Dutchman\u2019s breeches became a thing of sinister menace, and the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the Gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity, and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor. Nahum ploughed and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the upland lot, but did nothing with the land around the house. He knew it would be of no use, and hoped that the summer\u2019s strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil.

The shunning of his house by neighbours told on him, of course; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being at school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the gossip. Thaddeus, an especially sensitive youth, suffered the most. In May the insects came, and Nahum\u2019s place became a nightmare of buzzing and crawling. Most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and motions, and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience. The Gardners took to watching at night\u2014watching in all directions at random for something . . . they could not tell what. It was then that they all owned that Thaddeus had been right about the trees. Mrs. Gardner was the next to see it from the window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky. The boughs surely moved, and there was no wind. It must be the sap. Strangeness had come into everything growing now. Yet it was none of Nahum\u2019s family at all who made the next discovery.

Robed, shuffling shape beolw it. I decided there was no reason I should have felt that shaking touch of memory. Was it not taht a group should use a type of head covering as part of its uniforms? This head covering would be known to the community in some man without what I had started to call the \" Innsmouth look. \" I decided not to ask him any of the questions that bothered me. I remembered that things had been noticed in this hotel., I walked out into the square. The bus had left. I studied the scene and with judgmetn. One side of stone - paved area was the line of the river. The side was a - circle of brick buildings with slanted roofs from around the 1800s. streets went from them to the,, and southwest. The streetlights were and \u2014 all - power bulbs. I was my plans required me to leave, though I knew the moon would be.\n###\nThis, acting on my imagination, had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it. There was not, I soon decided, any reason why I should have felt that shuddering touch of evil pseudo-memory. Was it not natural that a local mystery cult should adopt among its regimentals an unique type of head-dress made familiar to the community in some strange way\u2014perhaps as treasure-trove? A very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalks\u2014lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three. The lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harboured small shops with dingy signs, and I noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along. The sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct, and presently I saw a fairly deep river-gorge ahead, spanned by a wide, iron-railed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out. As we clanked over the bridge I looked out on both sides and observed some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part way down. The water far below was very abundant, and I could see two vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least one downstream on my left. From this point the noise was quite deafening. Then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the right-hand side in front of a tall, cupola-crowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a half-effaced sign proclaiming it to be the Gilman House. I was glad to get out of that bus, and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby. There was only one person in sight\u2014an elderly man without what I had come to call the \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d\u2014and I decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me; remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel. Instead, I strolled out on the square, from which the bus had already gone, and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly. One side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of the river; the other was a semicircle of slant-roofed brick buildings of about the 1800 period, from which several streets radiated away to the southeast, south, and southwest. Lamps were depressingly few and small\u2014all low-powered incandescents\u2014and I was glad that my plans called for departure before dark, even though I knew the moon would be bright."}

New land rising encouraged this move, though the ocean was never fully left empty. Another reason for moving to land was a new problem with breeding. Controlling shoggoths. Successful sea life depended on them. As time passed, the art of making neww life from non-living matter was lost, as the carvings sadly admitted. So the Old Ones had to shape life forms that already existed. On land, the great reptiles were very easy to manage. The sea shoggoths, which reproduced by splitting.

I said there were not enough blocks. I said I did not want to upset the superstitious miners. I said the clolege might not have enough money. I gave other reasons thta were either false or not important. Naturally, no one paid any attention to my wishes. Not even my son paid attention, though he was clearly very worried about my health. The next day I was up and walking around the camp. But I did not help with the digging. Seeing that I could not stop the work, I decided to go home as soon as possible for my own peace of mind. I made my son promise to fly me in the plane to Perth. Perth is a thousnad miles to the southwest. He would fly me as soon as he had looked oevr the area I wanted left alone. I thought that if the thing I saw was still there, I might try to give a specific warning. I would do this even if it made people laugh at me. It was just possible that the miners who knew the local stories might support me. Humouring me, my son made the survey that same afternoon. He flew over all the land my walk could have covered. But nothing of what I had found was still visible. It was like the basalt block all over again. The moving sand had removed every sgin. For a moment, I almost regertted losing a certain terrifying object in my pure fear. But now I know that the loss was a kindness. I can still believe my whole experience was not real. This is especially true if, as I deeply hope, that hellish hole is never found. Wingate took me to Perth July on the 20th. He would not give up the trip and go home. He stayed with me until the 25th. On the 25th, the steamer for Liverpool left. Now, in the cabin of the Empress, I am thinking about whole matter. I have decided that my son at least must be told. He will decide whether to tell moer people. To be ready for anything, I have written this summary of my background. Others already know parts of it. I will now tell as briefly as possible what seemed to happen when I was away from the camp that night. Nerves on edge, and pushed by a twisted eagerness from that unexplainable urge. The urge was mixed with dread and false memory, pulling me to the northeast. I walked slowly on under the moon. Hree and there I saw, half-covered by sand, those Cyclopean blocks. They were left from unknown and forgotten ages.\n###\nMy reasoning was patently weak\u2014for I mentioned a dearth of blocks, a wish not to offend the superstitious miners, a possible shortage of funds from the college, and other things either untrue or irrelevant. Naturally, no one paid the least attention to my new wishes\u2014not even my son, whose concern for my health was very obvious. The next day I was up and around the camp, but took no part in the excavations. Seeing that I could not stop the work, I decided to return home as soon as possible for the sake of my nerves, and made my son promise to fly me in the plane to Perth\u2014a thousand miles to the southwest\u2014as soon as he had surveyed the region I wished let alone. If, I reflected, the thing I had seen was still visible, I might decide to attempt a specific warning even at the cost of ridicule. It was just conceivable that the miners who knew the local folklore might back me up. Humouring me, my son made the survey that very afternoon; flying over all the terrain my walk could possibly have covered. Yet nothing of what I had found remained in sight. It was the case of the anomalous basalt block all over again\u2014the shifting sand had wiped out every trace. For an instant I half regretted having lost a certain awesome object in my stark fright\u2014but now I know that the loss was merciful. I can still believe my whole experience an illusion\u2014especially if, as I devoutly hope, that hellish abyss is never found. Wingate took me to Perth July 20, though declining to abandon the expedition and return home. He stayed with me until the 25th, when the steamer for Liverpool sailed. Now, in the cabin of the Empress, I am pondering long and frantically on the entire matter, and have decided that my son at least must be informed. It shall rest with him whether to diffuse the matter more widely. In order to meet any eventuality I have prepared this summary of my background\u2014as already known in a scattered way to others\u2014and will now tell as briefly as possible what seemed to happen during my absence from the camp that hideous night. Nerves on edge, and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable, dread-mingled, pseudo-mnemonic urge toward the northeast, I plodded on beneath the evil, burning moon. Here and there I saw, half-shrouded by the sand, those primal Cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons."}

He shook at the story they told. The history of Leng walked through those ancient paintings. The horned, hooved, and wide-mouthed almost-humans danced evilly among forgotten cities. There were scenes of old wars. In them, Leng's almost-humans fought with the swollen purple spiders from the nearby valleys. There were also scenes of the coming of the black ships from the moon. There were scenes of the submission of Leng's people to the many-shaped and formless evils. Those evils hopped and struggled and wriggled out of the ships. They worshipped those slippery greyish-white evils as gods. They never complained when groups of their best. Fattest males were taken away in the black ships. The monstrous moon-beasts made their camp on a sharp island in the sea. Carter coudl tell from the paintings that this was the same lonely nameless rock he had seen when sailing to Inganok. That grey crused rock is avoiedd by the sailors of Inganok. Trerible howls echo from it all through the night. Those paintings also showed the great port city and capital of the almost-humans. It was proud and had pillars between the cliffs and the basalt docks. It was amazing with high temples and carved places. Great gardens and streets with columns led from the cliffs. They led from each of the six gates crowned with sphinxes. They led to a huge central square. In that square was a pair of winged giant lions. They guarded the top of an underground staircase. Again and again, those huge winged lions were shown. Their great sieds of dark stone shone in the grey half-light of day. They shone in the cloudy glow of night. As Carter walked past their mnay repeated pictures, he finally understood what they were. He understood what city the almost-humans had ruled. Long ago before the black ships came. There could be no mistake. The legends of dreamland are many and detailed. Indubitably that first city was no other place than the famous Sarkomand. Its ruins had been white for a mililon years before the first true human saw the light. Its two giant lions guard forever the steps that lead down from dreamland to the Great Abyss. Other pictures showed the thin grey peaks dividing Leng from Inganok. They showed the montsrous shantak-birds that build nests on the ledges halfway up.\n###\nCarter saw them fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp, and shuddered at the tale they told. Through those archaic frescoes Leng\u2019s annals stalked; and the horned, hooved, and wide-mouthed almost-humans danced evilly amidst forgotten cities. There were scenes of old wars, wherein Leng\u2019s almost-humans fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales; and there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon, and of the submission of Leng\u2019s people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them. Those slippery greyish-white blasphemies they worshipped as gods, nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were taken away in the black galleys. The monstrous moon-beasts made their camp on a jagged isle in the sea, and Carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to Inganok; that grey accursed rock which Inganok\u2019s seamen shun, and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the night. And in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the almost-humans; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves, and wondrous with high fanes and carven places. Great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six sphinx-crowned gates to a vast central plaza, and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase. Again and again were those huge winged lions shewn, their mighty flanks of diorite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and the cloudy phosphorescence of the night. And as Carter stumbled past their frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were, and what city it was that the almost-humans had ruled so anciently before the coming of the black galleys. There could be no mistake, for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse. Indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied Sarkomand, whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the first true human saw the light, and whose twin titan lions guard eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the Great Abyss. Other views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing Leng from Inganok, and the monstrous shantak-birds that build nests on the ledges half way up."}

Some extensive cave-in had obliterated all trace of the underground passage, while the rain had washed so much earth back into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had dug that other day. I likewise made a difficult trip to the distant hamlet where the death-creature had been burnt, and was little repaid for my trouble. In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several bones, but apparently none of the monster\u2019s. The squatters said the thing had had only one victim; but in this I judged them inaccurate, since besides the complete skull of a human being, there was another bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull at some time. Though the rapid drop of the monster had been seen, no one could say just what the creature was like; those who had glimpsed it called it simply a devil. Examining the great tree where it had lurked, I could discern no distinctive marks. I tried to find some trail into the black forest, but on this occasion could not stand the sight of those morbidly large boles, or of those vast serpent-like roots that twisted so malevolently before they sank into the earth."}

These soemtimes still held the petrified wooden planks. These planks were the real shutters and doors. They were elaborately carved and polished. All [THING] parts were gone long ago. But some doors were still in place. We had to force them aside as we went from [THING] to room. [THING] - frames with strange clear panes survived here and there. Most panes were elliptical. They were not found in large numbers. There were also many large niches. They were generally empty. But sometimes they held a strange object carved from green soapstone. Thsee were either broken or maybe too low in quality to take away. Other openings were surely linked to past mechanical systems. These were for heating, lighting, and similar things. Such systems are hinted at in many carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain. But sometimes they were inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles. Most tiles have now fallen. Floors were also paved with such tiles. But palin stonework was more common. As I said, all furniture and other movable items were gone. But the sculptures gave a clear picture. They showed the strange devices that once filled these tomb - like, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet, the floors were usually thick with broken pieces, litter, and debris. But farther down, this condition lessened. In some lower rooms. Halls, there was little more than gritty dust. Old crusty layers. Some areas had an eerie look of being freshly swept and perfectly clean. Of course, where cracks. Collapses happened, the lower levels were as messy as the upper ones. A central court saved the inner areas from total darkness. We had seen such courts in other structures from the air. So we rarely needed our electric torches in the upper rooms. We used them only when looking closely at carved details. Below the ice - cap, however, the twilight grew deeper. In many parts of the complex ground level, it was nearly completely black. To get even a basic idea of our thoughts. Feelings, one must combine a hopelessly confusing mix of passing moods, memories. We were moving through this ancient, silent maze of non - human stonework. The sheer terrifying age. Deadly emptiness of the place were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive [THING]. But added to these were the recent unexplained horror at the camp. Also added were the revelations that came all too soon from the terrible [THING] sculptures around us.\n###\nInterrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive twelve-foot doorways; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden planks\u2014elaborately carved and polished\u2014of the actual shutters and doors. All metal fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors remained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room to room. Window-frames with odd transparent panes\u2014mostly elliptical\u2014survived here and there, though in no considerable quantity. There were also frequent niches of great magnitude, generally empty, but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal. Other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical facilities\u2014heating, lighting, and the like\u2014of a sort suggested in many of the carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes been inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now. Floors were also paved with such tiles, though plain stonework predominated. As I have said, all furniture and other moveables were absent; but the sculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once filled these tomb-like, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the floors were generally thick with detritus, litter, and debris; but farther down this condition decreased. In some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept immaculateness. Of course, where rifts or collapses had occurred, the lower levels were as littered as the upper ones. A central court\u2014as in other structures we had seen from the air\u2014saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we seldom had to use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying sculptured details. Below the ice-cap, however, the twilight deepened; and in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute blackness. To form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated this aeon-silent maze of unhuman masonry one must correlate a hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and impressions. The sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person, but added to these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp, and the revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures around us."}

We could understand nothing. We recalled one pattern, a sort of [THING] with rays. Scholars believed it meant a non - Roman oirgin. This suggested these altars were only taken over by the Roman priests from some older, perhaps native, temple on the same spot. On one block were some brown stains. They made me wonder.

The largest, in the centre of the room, had certain features on the upper surface which indicated its connexion with fire\u2014probably burnt offerings.

Aftre learning his connection to this \" hidden \" person, he started to search for information about him in a way. In this search, he found than he hoped. letters, diaries. Piles of memories in Providence attics. places gave sections. The writers had not thought these were to throw. One piece of information came from as New York., some Rhode Island colonial letters were kept in the Museum at Fraunces ' Tavern., the thing, and what Dr. Willett believed was the cause of Ward 's ruin, was the material found in August 1919 behind the wall panels of the falling - down house in Olney Court. That was what revealed those views whose end was than any hole. Joseph Curwen, as shown by the stories in what Ward heard. Dug up, was a, puzzling. person. He had run from Salem to Providence at the start of the witchcraft scare. He feared being accused because of his habits and chemical or tests. He was a - looking man thirty years. He was allowed to become a citizen of Providence. After that, he bought a home plot of Gregory Dexter 's place, near the bottom of Olney Street. His house was built on Stampers ' Hill west of the Town Srteet, in what became Olney Court. In 1761, he replaced this with a house on the spo,t which stands., the thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to become than when he arrived. He took part in shipping businesses. He bought dock space near Mile - End Cove. He helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713. In 1723, he was one of the people who started the Congregational Church on the hill. He kept the appearance of a man not over thirty. As the decades passed, this trait started to attract attention. Curwen explained it by saying he came from ancestors. Lived a life that did not wear him down.\n###\nBefore this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \u201chushed-up\u201d character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces\u2019 Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willett\u2019s opinion formed the definite source of Ward\u2019s undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit. Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence\u2014that universal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting\u2014at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments. He was a colourless-looking man of about thirty, and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter buying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexter\u2019s at about the foot of Olney Street. His house was built on Stampers\u2019 Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing. Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out."}

I thought of the wishes of age. I tried to awaken my hsot 's mood. I whistled a of the tunes I had listened to the ngiht. But I did not continue this for than a moment. When the musician recognized the whistled tune, his face. It showed an expression I could not understand. His,, bony hand reached out to stop my mouth. He silenced my imitation. As he did this, he showed his strangeness. He cast a look toward the curtained window. He seemed of some intruder. This glance was. The attic stood and to reach above all the roofs. This window was the point on the street, as the doorkeeper had told me, from which one could see over the wall at the top. The man 's glance reminded me of Blandot 's remark. With a wish, I felt a desire to look out. I wanted to see the. view of roofs. Ciyt lights beyond the hill - top. Of all the people living in the Rue d'Auseil, thsi musician could see it. I moved toward the window. I would have pulled the curtains. With a anger than, the mute lodger was upon me. This time he motinoed with his head toward the door. He tried to drag me with both hands. I was with my host. I ordered him to let me go. I told him I would leave at. His grip relaxed. When he saw my disgust and offense, his anger seemed to fade. He tightened his grip, but this time in a way. He forced me into a chair. with a look of longing, he crossed to the table. he wrote words with a pencil. He wrote in the French of a foreigner. The note he handed me asked for tolerance and forgiveness. Zann said that he was,, and troubled by fears and problems. These were connected to his music and to things. He had enjoyed my listening to his music. He wished I would come and not mind his ways. But he could not play his music for another person. He could not bear hearing it from another person. Nor could he bear having anything in his room touched by another person.\n###\nFor a moment I was inclined to use persuasion, regarding rather lightly the whims of senility; and even tried to awaken my host\u2019s weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which I had listened the night before. But I did not pursue this course for more than a moment; for when the dumb musician recognised the whistled air his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond analysis, and his long, cold, bony right hand reached out to stop my mouth and silence the crude imitation. As he did this he further demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a startled glance toward the lone curtained window, as if fearful of some intruder\u2014a glance doubly absurd, since the garret stood high and inaccessible above all the adjacent roofs, this window being the only point on the steep street, as the concierge had told me, from which one could see over the wall at the summit. The old man\u2019s glance brought Blandot\u2019s remark to my mind, and with a certain capriciousness I felt a wish to look out over the wide and dizzying panorama of moonlit roofs and city lights beyond the hill-top, which of all the dwellers in the Rue d\u2019Auseil only this crabbed musician could see. I moved toward the window and would have drawn aside the nondescript curtains, when with a frightened rage even greater than before the dumb lodger was upon me again; this time motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag me thither with both hands. Now thoroughly disgusted with my host, I ordered him to release me, and told him I would go at once. His clutch relaxed, and as he saw my disgust and offence his own anger seemed to subside. He tightened his relaxing grip, but this time in a friendly manner; forcing me into a chair, then with an appearance of wistfulness crossing to the littered table, where he wrote many words with a pencil in the laboured French of a foreigner. The note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and forgiveness. Zann said that he was old, lonely, and afflicted with strange fears and nervous disorders connected with his music and with other things. He had enjoyed my listening to his music, and wished I would come again and not mind his eccentricities. But he could not play to another his weird harmonies, and could not bear hearing them from another; nor could he bear having anything in his room touched by another."}

As the rest of the watchers on that stormy hill had turned toward the road, Ammi had looked for an instant. He looked at the shadowed valley of ruin that had. sheltered his friend. From that stricken, - away spot, he had seen something rise. It sank down upon the place from which the horror had shot into the sky. It was a color. But it was not any color of our earth or skies. Because Ammi recognized that color. Knew this bit must hide in the well, he has been. Ammi would go near the place. It is over half a century since the horror happened. But he has been. He will be when the reservoir covers it out. I shall be,. I do not like the way the sunlight changed color around the mouth of that abandoned well I passed. I hope the water will be. But, I shall drink it. I do not think I shall visit the Arkham country after this. Three of the men who had been with Ammi returned the morning to see the ruins by daylight.

Behind and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return, and all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black, frore gusts from interstellar space. It shrieked and howled, and lashed the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy, till soon the trembling party realised it would be no use waiting for the moon to shew what was left down there at Nahum\u2019s. Too awed even to hint theories, the seven shaking men trudged back toward Arkham by the north road. Ammi was worse than his fellows, and begged them to see him inside his own kitchen, instead of keeping straight on to town. He did not wish to cross the nighted, wind-whipped woods alone to his home on the main road. For he had had an added shock that the others were spared, and was crushed forever with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come. As the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set their faces toward the road, Ammi had looked back an instant at the shadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his ill-starred friend. And from that stricken, far-away spot he had seen something feebly rise, only to sink down again upon the place from which the great shapeless horror had shot into the sky. It was just a colour\u2014but not any colour of our earth or heavens. And because Ammi recognised that colour, and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down there in the well, he has never been quite right since. Ammi would never go near the place again. It is over half a century now since the horror happened, but he has never been there, and will be glad when the new reservoir blots it out. I shall be glad, too, for I do not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of that abandoned well I passed. I hope the water will always be very deep\u2014but even so, I shall never drink it. I do not think I shall visit the Arkham country hereafter. Three of the men who had been with Ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were not any real ruins."}

My spouse had attempted to telephone the linen service for fresh bedding, but the connection had failed before she had a chance to articulate the full extent of the calamity.

I will forget the windows with flaring lintels and the fanlights. They grew. the we went into this maze of age. We met no one. As time passed, the lighted windows became. The street - lights we saw used oil. They were of the lozenge shape. I saw some with candles., we crossed a court. My guide had to lead me with his hand through darkness. We reached a gate in a wall. We came to a piece of alley lit by lanterns. These were in front of every house. They were tin lanterns. They had cone - shaped tops and holes punched in the sides. This alley went. It was than I thought in this part of New York. The end was blocked by an ivy - covered wall. It was the wall of a estate. Beyond it I could see a cupola. I could see tree tops waving against a lightness in the sky. In this wall was a, - arched gate. It was made of oak with nails. The man unlocked it with a key. Leading me, he guided me in darkness. We walked over what felt like a path., we went up stone steps to the house door. He unlocked and opened it for me. We entered. As we did, I grew from a smell of mustiness. It welled out to meet us. It must have been the result of centuries of decay. My host did not seem to notice this. To be, I stayed. He led me up a curving staircase. We crossed a hall and entered a room. I heard him lock the door behind us. I saw him pull the curtains. They covered three - paned windows. The windows showed against the brightening sky. After that, he went to the mantel. He struck flint and steel. He lit two candles from a candelabrum with twelve holders. He made a gesture telling me to speak. In this light, I saw we were in a library. It was - furnished and had wood panels. It dated from the quarter of the century. It had doorway pediments. It had a cornice. It had a carved overmantel with a top of scrolls and an urn.\n###\nThe things we saw were very old and marvellous, or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which I viewed them, and I shall never forget the tottering Ionic columns and fluted pilasters and urn-headed iron fence-posts and flaring-lintelled windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity. We met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and fewer. The street-lights we first encountered had been of oil, and of the ancient lozenge pattern. Later I noticed some with candles; and at last, after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooden gate in a high wall, we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front of every seventh house\u2014unbelievably colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the sides. This alley led steeply uphill\u2014more steeply than I thought possible in this part of New York\u2014and the upper end was blocked squarely by the ivy-clad wall of a private estate, beyond which I could see a pale cupola, and the tops of trees waving against a vague lightness in the sky. In this wall was a small, low-arched gate of nail-studded black oak, which the man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key. Leading me within, he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path, and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house, which he unlocked and opened for me. We entered, and as we did so I grew faint from a reek of infinite mustiness which welled out to meet us, and which must have been the fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay. My host appeared not to notice this, and in courtesy I kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway, across a hall, and into a room whose door I heard him lock behind us. Then I saw him pull the curtains of the three small-paned windows that barely shewed themselves against the lightening sky; after which he crossed to the mantel, struck flint and steel, lighted two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces, and made a gesture enjoining soft-toned speech. In this feeble radiance I saw that we were in a spacious, well-furnished, and panelled library dating from the first quarter of the eighteenth century, with splendid doorway pediments, a delightful Doric cornice, and a magnificently carved overmantel with scroll-and-urn top."}

Verhaeren was Belgian agent at a trading post on the Congo. He believed he could find and get the preserved goddess. He had heard vague stories about it. The once powerful N\u2019bangus were now obedient servants of King Albert\u2019s government. With a little persuasion, they could be made to give up the frightening god they had taken. Therefore, When Jermyn sailed for England with excited hope. He expected that within a few months he would get a priceless ethnological relic. This would confirm the wildest story from his great-great-great-grandfather. That is, the wildest story he had ever heard. Perhaps Countrymen near Jermyn House had heard wilder tales. These were pasesd down from ancestors who listened to Sir Wade at the tables of the Knight\u2019s Head. Arthur Jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from M. Verhaeren. Meanwhile, he studied his mad ancestor's manuscripts with even more care. He began to feel very close to Sir Wade. He looked for relics of the latter's personal life in England. He also looked for relics of his African adventures. There had been many Oral accounts of the mysterious and priavte wife. But no physical relic of her stay at Jermyn Huose remained. Jermyn wondered what situation caused or allowed such complete removal. He decided the husband's madness was the main reason. He recalled that his great-great-great-grandmother was said to be the daughter of a Portuguese trader in Africa. Certainly her practical background. Shallow knowledge of the Dark Continent made her mock Sir Wade's talk about the interior. Such a man would not likely forgive that. She died in Africa, perhaps taken there by a husband dteermined to prove what he said. But as Jermyn thought about this, he had to smile at its pointlessness. It was a century and a half after both his strange ancestors died. Then, In June, 1913, a letter came from M. Verhaeren. It told of finding the preserved goddess. The Belgian stated it was a very extraordinary object. It was an object a non-expert colud not classify at all. Only a scientist could tell if it was human or ape-like. Its poor condition would make tihs process very hard. Time and the Congo climate do not preserve mummies wel.l This is especially true when their preservation is as unprofessional as it seemed here.\n###\nM. Verhaeren, Belgian agent at a trading-post on the Congo, believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess, of which he had vaguely heard; since the once mighty N\u2019bangus were now the submissive servants of King Albert\u2019s government, and with but little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had carried off. When Jermyn sailed for England, therefore, it was with the exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his great-great-great-grandfather\u2019s narratives\u2014that is, the wildest which he had ever heard. Countrymen near Jermyn House had perhaps heard wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to Sir Wade around the tables of the Knight\u2019s Head. Arthur Jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from M. Verhaeren, meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts left by his mad ancestor. He began to feel closely akin to Sir Wade, and to seek relics of the latter\u2019s personal life in England as well as of his African exploits. Oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded wife had been numerous, but no tangible relic of her stay at Jermyn House remained. Jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or permitted such an effacement, and decided that the husband\u2019s insanity was the prime cause. His great-great-great-grandmother, he recalled, was said to have been the daughter of a Portuguese trader in Africa. No doubt her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the Dark Continent had caused her to flout Sir Wade\u2019s talk of the interior, a thing which such a man would not be likely to forgive. She had died in Africa, perhaps dragged thither by a husband determined to prove what he had told. But as Jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not but smile at their futility, a century and a half after the death of both of his strange progenitors. In June, 1913, a letter arrived from M. Verhaeren, telling of the finding of the stuffed goddess. It was, the Belgian averred, a most extraordinary object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify. Whether it was human or simian only a scientist could determine, and the process of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition. Time and the Congo climate are not kind to mummies; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here."}

Stumbling through the dim hallway, I went straight to the bare alcove. One grey dawn I began the ceremony before the silent cabinets.

I performed the breif washings with tap water. Wtih a shaking hand, I poured into the carafe of a smooth. One-eeyd device with a glass front. A bitter smell of blackened grounds answered my chants.

The machine\u2019s reservoir, I ascertained, lay in the recesses of the upper shelf, which harbored the dread implements during all the nocturnal hours that the apartment slumbered in accursed stillness.

It was in the nature and makeup of a certain smell. I do not knwo chemistry exactly. From the start, I was interested by the clean. Sharp qualities of the area. I had seen they were quite widely spread around the main hall. They were less strong in the nearby offices than near the check-in desk itself. There, modern cleaning had surely met weaker fight against its strict and firm rules. Now, after that recent cleaning that sent out long, staying fumes, it hit me strongly. The different notes. Layers of the smell system had a special link to the heart of the waiting room. That heart was clearly a source. Waves or currents of smell spread out from it without end and unevenly. It was as if the unhealthy place had thrown out visible threads of cleanliness. The idea of such threads gave me a thrill I could not explani. I stopped to study my reason for believing these smells were chemical events.\n###\nPresently, as I inhaled abstractedly the antiseptic atmosphere, my senses became arrested by something singular in the nature and composition of a certain olfactory element. Without having any exact knowledge of chemistry, I had from the first been intrigued by the sterile and astringent qualities of the region. I had noticed that they were pretty widely distributed around the central corridor, though less potent in the adjoining offices than near the triage desk itself, where modern sanitation had doubtless found feebler opposition to its stark and uncompromising dictates. Now, in the wake of that recent cleansing which cast long, lingering vapors, it struck me forcibly that the various notes and layers of the scent system had a peculiar relation to the heart of the waiting chamber. That heart was undeniably a fount from which the waves or currents of effluvia radiated indefinitely and irregularly, as if the unwholesome institution had thrown visible tendrils of purity. The idea of such tendrils gave me an unexplained thrill, and I stopped to analyse my reason for believing these odors chemical phenomena."}

At forty he had joined a group of office workers. At fifty-six he had left his job. Coworkers to work for a temporary telemarketing company. His task was very unpleasant.

At forty he had joined a legion of bureaucratic functionaries, and at fifty-six had abandoned his post and colleagues to labor with a transient telemarketing firm. His task was most odious.

They did not expect to hear Alistair Finch utter a shrill, inhuman groan, or to see him seize his bewildering antagonist with both hands, dash it to the surface of the desk, and scribble fiendishly at its blank margins. The form was incomplete, but not for long, and before anything could be done by the senior processor the document which had belonged to a policyholder was past comprehension."}

I am Romnod, and born of the blood of Teloth, but am not old in the ways of the granite city, and yearn daily for the warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song. Beyond the Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing, which men whisper of and say is both lovely and terrible. Thither would I go were I old enough to find the way, and thither shouldst thou go an thou wouldst sing and have men listen to thee. Let us leave the city Teloth and fare together among the hills of spring. Thou shalt shew me the ways of travel and I will attend thy songs at evening when the stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers. And peradventure it may be that Oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even the fair Aira thou seekest, for it is told that thou hast not known Aira since old days, and a name often changeth. Let us go to Oonai, O Iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say.\u201d And Iranon answered: \u201cBe it so, small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he must seek the mountains and beyond, and I would not leave thee to pine by the sluggish Zuro. But think not that delight and understanding dwell just across the Karthian hills, or in any spot thou canst find in a day\u2019s, or a year\u2019s, or a lustrum\u2019s journey. Behold, when I was small like thee I dwelt in the valley of Narthos by the frigid Xari, where none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself that when older I would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling dromedary-men in the market-place. But when I went to Sinara I found the dromedary-men all drunken and ribald, and saw that their songs were not as mine, so I travelled in a barge down the Xari to onyx-walled Jaren. And the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I wandered to many other cities. I have seen Stethelos that is below the great cataract, and have gazed on the marsh where Sarnath once stood."}

It was how she had damaged Edward 's nerves. He had creaetd a set of visions around her. He mumbled that his situation was one in a line. She was gaining control over him. He knew that one day she would release him., she let him go when. She could not hold on for at one time. She toko his body. She went to places with no name for rituals with no name. She left him in her body. She locked him. But she could not hold on. he would find himself back in his body. He would be in some,, and place. she would get control of him. she could not. he was left. That was how I had found him. times he had to find his way from distances. He had to get someone to drive the car after he found it. The part was that she was holding on to him for periods each time. She wanted to be a man. She wanted to be. That was why she took control of him. She had sensed his mix of a made brain and a will. One day she would push him out. She would disappear with his body. She would disappear to become a magician like her father. She would leave him trapped in that body. That body was not., he knew about the Innsmouth blood. There had been dealings with creatures from the sea. It was. And Eprhaim \u2014 he had known the secret. When he grew, he did a thing to stay. He wanted to live. Asenath would succeed. One experiment had happened. As As Derby muttered on, I turned to look at him. I confirmed the feeling of change that an look had given me., he seemed in condition than. He seemed, developed. He did not have the trace of softness caused by his habits. It was as if he had been. exercised for the time in his life. I decided that Asenath 's force must have pushed him into paths of movement.\n###\nDuring our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again, more distinctly than before, and as I listened I caught a stream of utterly insane drivel about Asenath. The extent to which she had preyed on Edward\u2019s nerves was plain, for he had woven a whole set of hallucinations around her. His present predicament, he mumbled furtively, was only one of a long series. She was getting hold of him, and he knew that some day she would never let go. Even now she probably let him go only when she had to, because she couldn\u2019t hold on long at a time. She constantly took his body and went to nameless places for nameless rites, leaving him in her body and locking him upstairs\u2014but sometimes she couldn\u2019t hold on, and he would find himself suddenly in his own body again in some far-off, horrible, and perhaps unknown place. Sometimes she\u2019d get hold of him again and sometimes she couldn\u2019t. Often he was left stranded somewhere as I had found him . . . time and again he had to find his way home from frightful distances, getting somebody to drive the car after he found it. The worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer at a time. She wanted to be a man\u2014to be fully human\u2014that was why she got hold of him. She had sensed the mixture of fine-wrought brain and weak will in him. Some day she would crowd him out and disappear with his body\u2014disappear to become a great magician like her father and leave him marooned in that female shell that wasn\u2019t even quite human. Yes, he knew about the Innsmouth blood now. There had been traffick with things from the sea\u2014it was horrible. . . . And old Ephraim\u2014he had known the secret, and when he grew old did a hideous thing to keep alive . . . he wanted to live forever . . . Asenath would succeed\u2014one successful demonstration had taken place already. As Derby muttered on I turned to look at him closely, verifying the impression of change which an earlier scrutiny had given me. Paradoxically, he seemed in better shape than usual\u2014harder, more normally developed, and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused by his indolent habits. It was as if he had been really active and properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life, and I judged that Asenath\u2019s force must have pushed him into unwonted channels of motion and alertness."}

This mood made my reaction to the mirage. The mirage appeared from the and opalescent sky. This happened as we got to the mountains. Started to see the growing waves of the foothills. I had seen mirages in the weeks. Some of them were and as this one. But this one had a and quality of threatening meaning. I shook as the boiling maze of walls. Minarets appeared out of the disturbed ice - vapors above our heads. The effect was that of a city. Its architecture was not known to man or to imagination. It had groups of night - stonework. These showed twists of geometry rules. They reached the extremes of strangeness. There were cut - off cones. Some were terraced or grooved. They were topped by shafts. These were and and capped with layers of scalloped discs. There were, overhanging, table - structures. They suggested piles of slabs or plates or five - stars. Each one overlapped the one. There were combined cones and pyramids. They were. On top of cylinders. Flatter cut - off cones. There were needle - spires in groups of five. All of these structures seemed connected by tube bridges. These crossed from one to another at heights. The suggested size of the whole was and in its scale. The type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms seen. Drawn by the Arctic whaler Scoresby in 1820. At this time. Place, with those, mountain peaks rising, with that - world discovery in our minds. With the shadow of disaster covering of our trip, we all seemed to find in it a trace of hidden evil. meaning. I was when the mirage started to break. Though during this, the nightmare towers. Cones took on shapes of ugliness. As the illusion faded into churning opalescence, we began to look down. We saw that our journey 's end was not. The mountains rose like a wall. Their shapes showed with clearness without a field - glass.\n###\nThis mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills. I had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks, some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present sample; but this one had a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the troubled ice-vapours above our heads. The effect was that of a Cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to human imagination, with vast aggregations of night-black masonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws and attaining the most grotesque extremes of sinister bizarrerie. There were truncated cones, sometimes terraced or fluted, surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped discs; and strange, beetling, table-like constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars with each one overlapping the one beneath. There were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids, and occasional needle-like spires in curious clusters of five. All of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights, and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer giganticism. The general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms observed and drawn by the Arctic whaler Scoresby in 1820; but at this time and place, with those dark, unknown mountain peaks soaring stupendously ahead, that anomalous elder-world discovery in our minds, and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our expedition, we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely evil portent. I was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted temporary forms of even vaster hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again, and saw that our journey\u2019s end was not far off. The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzyingly up like a fearsome rampart of giants, their curious regularities shewing with startling clearness even without a field-glass."}

So they came to care less and less about good taste in what they hid. Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has been hidden since the old days. They are not talkative, as they hate to shake off the sleepiness that helps them forget. Sometimes one feels it would be kind to destroy these houses, for they must often dream. One afternoon in November, 1896, I was driven to a time - worn [THING] of this kind. The [THING] was so cold and heavy that any shelter was better than being outside. I had been traveling for some time among the [THING] of the Miskatonic Valley area. I was looking for certain family history information. Because my route was remote, winding. Uncertain, I thought it best to use a bicycle, even though it was late in the season. Now I found myself on a [THING] that seemed unused. I had chosen it as the shortest way to Arkham. The sotrm caught me at a point far from any [THING]. I saw no shelter except an old and unpleasant wooden [THING]. It blinked with dirty windows from between two large, leafless elm trees near the bottom of a rocky hill. Distant though it was from what remained of a [THING], the [THING] still gave me a bad feeling the moment I saw it. Honest, healthy buildings do not stare at travelers so slyly and hauntingly. In my famiyl history research, I had heard stories from a century before that made me dislike places like this. Yet the force of the weather was enough to overcome my doubts. I did not hesitate to push my biyccle up the weedy slope to the closed [THING]. The [THING] seemed both suggestive and secretive. I had somehow assumed the [THING] was empty. Yet as I got closer, I was not so sure. The paths were overgrown with weeds. They seemed a little too well - kept to mean it was completely deserted. So, instead of trying the [THING], I knocked. As I did, I felt a fear I could hardly explain. As I waited on the rough, mossy [THING] thta served as a step, I looked at the nearby windows. The [THING] above the [THING]. I noticed that. They were old, loose. Almost blocked by dirt, they were not broken.\n###\nErring as all mortals must, they were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else; so that they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed. Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days; and they are not communicative, being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget. Sometimes one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses, for they must often dream. It was to a time-battered edifice of this description that I was driven one afternoon in November, 1896, by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure. I had been travelling for some time amongst the people of the Miskatonic Valley in quest of certain genealogical data; and from the remote, devious, and problematical nature of my course, had deemed it convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season. Now I found myself upon an apparently abandoned road which I had chosen as the shortest cut to Arkham; overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town, and confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden building which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill. Distant though it was from the remnant of a road, the house none the less impressed me unfavourably the very moment I espied it. Honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my genealogical researches I had encountered legends of a century before which biassed me against places of this kind. Yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive. I had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned, yet as I approached it I was not so sure; for though the walks were indeed overgrown with weeds, they seemed to retain their nature a little too well to argue complete desertion. Therefore instead of trying the door I knocked, feeling as I did so a trepidation I could scarcely explain. As I waited on the rough, mossy rock which served as a doorstep, I glanced at the neighbouring windows and the panes of the transom above me, and noticed that although old, rattling, and almost opaque with dirt, they were not broken."}

Yet according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had themselves known the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a sombre and recurrent type of scene in which the Old Ones were shewn in the act of recoiling affrightedly from some object\u2014never allowed to appear in the design\u2014found in the great river and indicated as having been washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad-forests from those horrible westward mountains."}

They made it the center of a cult feared across half the heptarchy. Around 1000 A.D., the place is mentioned in a record. It is described as a stone priory. It housed a and group of monks. It was surrounded by gardens that needed no walls to keep out a population. It was destroyed by the Danes., after the Norman Conquest it must have declined. This is because there was no obstacle when Henry the Third gave the site to my ancestor, Gilbert de la Poer, First Baron Exham, in 1261. There is no report about my family before this date. But something must have happened. One record refers to a de la Poer as \" cursed by God \" in 1307., village legends had nothing. fear to tell about the castle built on the foundations of the temple. The stories told by the fire were of the kind. They were because of their silence and avoidance. They described my ancestors as a line of demons. Compared to them, Gilles de Retz. The Marquis de Sade would seem like beginners. They whispered hints about my ancestors being for villagers disappearing. over generations. The characters, it seems, were the barons and their heirs. At, was whispered about these. It was said that if an heir had interests, he would die. This was to make way for another heir of the family. There seemed to be an cult within the family. It was led by the head of the house. it was closed to all but a members. Choice Temperament than was the basis for joining this cult. This is because people who married into the family entered it. Lady Margaret Trevor from Cornwall, wife of Godfrey, the son of the baron, became a terror for children over the countryside. She was the demon heroine of a song. It is not forgotten near the Welsh border. Preserved in songs, though not showing the point, is the story of Lady Mary de la Poer. after her marriage to the Earl of Shrewsfield, she was killed by him. Both killers were forgiven and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed. They dared not repeat what they told him to the world.\n###\nLikewise was it said that the rites did not vanish with the Roman power, and that certain among the Saxons added to what remained of the temple, and gave it the essential outline it subsequently preserved, making it the centre of a cult feared through half the heptarchy. About 1000 A.D. the place is mentioned in a chronicle as being a substantial stone priory housing a strange and powerful monastic order and surrounded by extensive gardens which needed no walls to exclude a frightened populace. It was never destroyed by the Danes, though after the Norman Conquest it must have declined tremendously; since there was no impediment when Henry the Third granted the site to my ancestor, Gilbert de la Poer, First Baron Exham, in 1261. Of my family before this date there is no evil report, but something strange must have happened then. In one chronicle there is a reference to a de la Poer as \u201ccursed of God\u201d in 1307, whilst village legendry had nothing but evil and frantic fear to tell of the castle that went up on the foundations of the old temple and priory. The fireside tales were of the most grisly description, all the ghastlier because of their frightened reticence and cloudy evasiveness. They represented my ancestors as a race of hereditary daemons beside whom Gilles de Retz and the Marquis de Sade would seem the veriest tyros, and hinted whisperingly at their responsibility for the occasional disappearance of villagers through several generations. The worst characters, apparently, were the barons and their direct heirs; at least, most was whispered about these. If of healthier inclinations, it was said, an heir would early and mysteriously die to make way for another more typical scion. There seemed to be an inner cult in the family, presided over by the head of the house, and sometimes closed except to a few members. Temperament rather than ancestry was evidently the basis of this cult, for it was entered by several who married into the family. Lady Margaret Trevor from Cornwall, wife of Godfrey, the second son of the fifth baron, became a favourite bane of children all over the countryside, and the daemon heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet extinct near the Welsh border. Preserved in balladry, too, though not illustrating the same point, is the hideous tale of Lady Mary de la Poer, who shortly after her marriage to the Earl of Shrewsfield was killed by him and his mother, both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the world."}

The - shape that followed him. They, like him, had turned into strands of, glowing fog in this emptiness of darknes.s Something had gone aheadand he believed their movement was not in a line., they moved along the curves and spirals of some whirlpool. This whirlpool followed rules to the physics and math of any universe. there had been a suggestion of, jumping shadows. There was a, - pulsing, and the, whistling of an flute. But that was all. Gilman decided he had gotten that idea from what he read in the Necronomicon about the being Azathoth. This being rules all time. Space from a placed throne at the center of Chaos. After the blood was cleaned off, the wrist injury was. Gilman wondered about the spot of the two holes. He thought that there was no blood on the bedcover where he had been lying. This was because there was blood on his skin and sleeve. Had he been walking in his sleep in his room? Had the rat bitten him. He sat in a chair. Stood in some position? He looked in all corners for drops or marks but found none. He thought he should spread flour inside the room as outside the door. But, no proof of his sleepwalking was needed. He knew he did walk. he must stop it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help. This morning the pulls from space seemed. But they were repalced by another feeling to explain. It was a, wish to flee from his situation. But it gave no hint of the direction he wanted to go. When he lifted the - pointed object on the table, he thought the pull toward the north grew a. But, it was overcome by the and desire. He carried the - object down to Elwood \u2019s room. He prepared himself against the crying sounds of the repairman that rose from the floor.\n###\nHe had been taken there by the bubble-congeries and the little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they, like himself, had changed to wisps of milky, barely luminous mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness. Something else had gone on ahead\u2014a larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of form\u2014and he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line, but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos. Eventually there had been a hint of vast, leaping shadows, of a monstrous, half-acoustic pulsing, and of the thin, monotonous piping of an unseen flute\u2014but that was all. Gilman decided he had picked up that last conception from what he had read in the Necronomicon about the mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the centre of Chaos. When the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight, and Gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures. It occurred to him that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had lain\u2014which was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and cuff. Had he been sleep-walking within his room, and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position? He looked in every corner for brownish drops or stains, but did not find any. He had better, he thought, sprinkle flour within the room as well as outside the door\u2014though after all no further proof of his sleep-walking was needed. He knew he did walk\u2014and the thing to do now was to stop it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help. This morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable. It was a vague, insistent impulse to fly away from his present situation, but held not a hint of the specific direction in which he wished to fly. As he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a trifle stronger; but even so, it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urge. He took the spiky image down to Elwood\u2019s room, steeling himself against the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor."}

Not many weeks ago, on a street corner in the village of Pascoag, Rhode Island, a tall, strong, healthy-looking walker caused much talk because of a strannge mistake in behavior. He had, it seems, been coming down the hill on the road from Chepachet. Meeitng busy part of town, he had turned left onto the main street where several plain business buildings ggive a small city feeling. At this point, with no clear reason, he made hiss surprising mistake. He stared oddly for a second at the tallest building in front of him. Then, with a series of scared, crazy screams, he started a widl RUN that ended in a trip. fall at the next crosisng. Brushed off by helpful hands, he was found to be awakee, not physically hurt. Clearly over his sudden nervous attack. He muttered some embarrassed explanations about a stress he had been under.. With a downcast look, he turned back up the Chepachet road. He walked out of sight wihtout looking behind him even once. It was A strange thing to happen to such a large, strong, normal-looking.

He had, it appears, been descending the hill by the road from Chepachet; and encountering the compact section, had turned to his left into the main thoroughfare where several modest business blocks convey a touch of the urban. At this point, without visible provocation, he committed his astonishing lapse; staring queerly for a second at the tallest of the buildings before him, and then, with a series of terrified, hysterical shrieks, breaking into a frantic run which ended in a stumble and fall at the next crossing. Picked up and dusted off by ready hands, he was found to be conscious, organically unhurt, and evidently cured of his sudden nervous attack. He muttered some shamefaced explanations involving a strain he had undergone, and with downcast glance turned back up the Chepachet road, trudging out of sight without once looking behind him. It was a strange incident to befall so large, robust, normal-featured, and capable-looking a man, and the strangeness was not lessened by the remarks of a bystander who had recognised him as the boarder of a well-known dairyman on the outskirts of Chepachet."}

Chrods, vibrations, and joyful harmonies echoed all aorund me. At the same time, my amazed eyes saw a huge and beautiful sight. Walls, columns, and beams made of living fire shone brightly around me. I seemed to float in the air. These fiery shapes reached up to a very high, arched ceiling of amazing beauty. Along with this grand palace view. Sometimes replacing it in a changing pattern, I saw wide fields. I SAW tall mountains and welcoming caves. Every lovely scene my hpapy EYES could imagine was there. Yet everything was made of a glowing, light, and changeable substance. This subsstance was both like spirti and like matter. AS I looked, I understood that my own mind controlled these wonderful changes. Each view that appeared was the one my changing mind most wanted to see. In tihs perfect place, I did not feel like a stranger. Every sight and sound was known to mme. It had been this way for countless ages before. It woudl be this way for countless ages to come.\n###\nThe sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me. Chords, vibrations, and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand; while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty. Walls, columns, and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where I seemed to float in air; extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendour. Blending with this display of palatial magnificence, or rather, supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation, were glimpses of wide plains and graceful valleys, high mountains and inviting grottoes; covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eye could conceive of, yet formed wholly of some glowing, ethereal, plastic entity, which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter. As I gazed, I perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses; for each vista which appeared to me, was the one my changing mind most wished to behold. Amidst this elysian realm I dwelt not as a stranger, for each sight and sound was familiar to me; just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before, and would be for like eternities to come."}

In the morning, mist rises from the sea by the cliffs beyond Kingsport. White and feathery, it comes from the deep to join its brothers the clouds. It is of dreams of pastures and caves of sea creatures., in summer rains on the roofs of poets, the clouds scatter pieces of those dreams. This is men will not live without hearing about, secrets. It is. They hear wonders that planets tell to planets in the night. When stories spread in the caves of sea gods. Seashells in cities blow tunes learned from the Elder Ones, mists gather. Go to heaven of knowledge. Eyes looking toward the ocean from the rocks see a whiteness. It is as if the edge of the cliff were the edge of the world. The bells of buoys ring in the fairy - tale air., north of Kingsport, the cliffs rise and. They go up in layers, one above another, until the one hangs in the sky like a cloud of wind. This is, a point sticking out into space. the coast turns where the Miskatonic flows out of the plains past Arkham. It brings forest legends and, quaint memories of New England 's hills. The sea people in Kingsport look up at that cliff as sea people look up at the North Star. They measure the night 's watches by how it hides. Shows the Great Bear, Cassiopeia. For them, it is part of sky., it is hidden from them when the mist hides the stars or the sun. They lvoe some of the cliffs, like the one whose profile they call Father Neptune. The one with column - steps they call The Causeway. But they fear this one because it is to the sky. The sailors coming from a voyage make a sign when they see it.

This is when buoys ring in the fairy - tale air.\n###\nIn the morning mist comes up from the sea by the cliffs beyond Kingsport. White and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds, full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan. And later, in still summer rains on the steep roofs of poets, the clouds scatter bits of those dreams, that men shall not live without rumour of old, strange secrets, and wonders that planets tell planets alone in the night. When tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons, and conches in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the Elder Ones, then great eager mists flock to heaven laden with lore, and oceanward eyes on the rocks see only a mystic whiteness, as if the cliff\u2019s rim were the rim of all earth, and the solemn bells of buoys tolled free in the aether of faery. Now north of archaic Kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious, terrace on terrace, till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a grey frozen wind-cloud. Alone it is, a bleak point jutting in limitless space, for there the coast turns sharp where the great Miskatonic pours out of the plains past Arkham, bringing woodland legends and little quaint memories of New England\u2019s hills. The sea-folk in Kingsport look up at that cliff as other sea-folk look up at the pole-star, and time the night\u2019s watches by the way it hides or shews the Great Bear, Cassiopeia, and the Dragon. Among them it is one with the firmament, and truly, it is hidden from them when the mist hides the stars or the sun. Some of the cliffs they love, as that whose grotesque profile they call Father Neptune, or that whose pillared steps they term The Causeway; but this one they fear because it is so near the sky. The Portuguese sailors coming in from a voyage cross themselves when they first see it, and the old Yankees believe it would be much graver matter than death to climb it, if indeed that were possible. Nevertheless there is an ancient house on that cliff, and at evening men see lights in the small-paned windows. The ancient house has always been there, and people say One dwells therein who talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep, and perhaps sees singular things oceanward at those times when the cliff\u2019s rim becomes the rim of all earth, and solemn buoys toll free in the white aether of faery."}

It occurred in the 1880s. A fmaily disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact. Everyone told me to ignore Ammi Pierce's crazy stories. I went to see him the next monring anyway. I heard he lived alone in an shaky cottage. The trees grew very there. The place was very and scary. It had started to give off a faint, smell. Houses that stand too often have that smell. I had to knock many times to wake the man. He shuffled to the door slowly and timidly. I could see he was not happy to see me. He was not as weak as I expected. But his eyes drooped in a way. His messy clothes and white beard made him look tired and sad. I did not know how to get him to tell his stories. I pretended I had business. I told him about my land surveying work. I asked general questions about the area. He was much smarter and more educated than I was told. Before I knew it, he understood the subject as well as any man I talked to in Arkham. He was not like other country people I knew in areas where reservoirs were planned. He did not prtoest about the miles of woods. Farmland that would be flooded. Perhaps he would have if his home was not outside the future lake's boundary. Relief was all he showed. He felt relief about the doom of the valleys. He had roamed those valleys all his life. They were better underwater now. They had bene better underwater since the days. With this opening, his rough voice became His body leaned forward. His right forefinger began to point shakiyl and with emphasis. It was then that I heard the story. His wandering voice scraped and whisperde. I shivered again and again, even though it was summer. Often I had to bring the speaker back from his ramblings. I had to piece together scientific points he only knew from fading memories of professors' talk. I had to bridge gaps where his logic and sense of continuity borke down.\n###\nIt was not a matter of old legendry at all, but something within the lifetime of those who spoke. It had happened in the \u2019eighties, and a family had disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce\u2019s crazy tales, I sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick. It was a fearsomely archaic place, and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long. Only with persistent knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he shuffled timidly to the door I could tell he was not glad to see me. He was not so feeble as I had expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious way, and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn and dismal. Not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned a matter of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague questions about the district. He was far brighter and more educated than I had been led to think, and before I knew it had grasped quite as much of the subject as any man I had talked with in Arkham. He was not like other rustics I had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief was all that he shewed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed all his life. They were better under water now\u2014better under water since the strange days. And with this opening his husky voice sank low, while his body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and impressively. It was then that I heard the story, and as the rambling voice scraped and whispered on I shivered again and again despite the summer day. Often I had to recall the speaker from ramblings, piece out scientific points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors\u2019 talk, or bridge over gaps where his sense of logic and continuity broke down."}

Elwood would, if awake, rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep. Very soon, too, he must see the specialist. Meanwhile they would take the spiky image around to the various museums and to certain professors; seeking identification and stating that it had been found in a public rubbish-can. Also, Dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the walls. Braced up by Elwood\u2019s companionship, Gilman attended classes that day. Strange urges still tugged at him, but he could sidetrack them with considerable success. During a free period he shewed the queer image to several professors, all of whom were intensely interested, though none of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin. That night he slept on a couch which Elwood had had the landlord bring to the second-story room, and for the first time in weeks was wholly free from disquieting dreams. But the feverishness still hung on, and the whines of the loomfixer were an unnerving influence. During the next few days Gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from morbid manifestations. He had, Elwood said, shewed no tendency to talk or rise in his sleep; and meanwhile the landlord was putting rat-poison everywhere. The only disturbing element was the talk among the superstitious foreigners, whose imaginations had become highly excited. Mazurewicz was always trying to make him get a crucifix, and finally forced one upon him which he said had been blessed by the good Father Iwanicki. Desrochers, too, had something to say\u2014in fact, he insisted that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above him on the first and second nights of Gilman\u2019s absence from it. Paul Choynski thought he heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night, and claimed that his door had been softly tried, while Mrs. Dombrowski vowed she had seen Brown Jenkin for the first time since All-Hallows. But such naive reports could mean very little, and Gilman let the cheap metal crucifix hang idly from a knob on his host\u2019s dresser. For three days Gilman and Elwood canvassed the local museums in an effort to identify the strange spiky image, but always without success. In every quarter, however, interest was intense; for the utter alienage of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity."}

Formulas when he was not lying on his thin iron bed. His hearing became unnaturally and painfully sharp. He had stopped the cheap clock on the mantel long ago. Its ticking had started to sound like loud artillery to him. At night, the quiet movements of the dark city outside bothered him. The evil sound of rats in the walls. The creaking of old wood in the house felt like a loud chaos to him. The darkness was always full of sounds he could not explain. Yet he sometimes shook with fear that those noises would stop. He feared that if they stopped, he would hear other, quieter noises hiding behind them. He was in the old city of Arkham. Its legends never changed. The roofs with two slopes clustered together. They swayed and sagged over attics. Witches hid in those attics from the King's men in the old, dark days of the Province. In that whole city, Nor was a place filled with more dark memories than his attic room. Tihs was because this same house and room had also sheltered old Keziah Mason long ago. No one could ever explain his final escape from Salem Gaol. That happened in 1692. jailer went mad. He talked about a small, furry thing with white fangs. It ran out of Keziah's cell. Not even Cotton Mather coudl explain the marks on the grey stone walls. The marks were curves and angles. They were smeared with a red, sticky fluid. Possibly Gilman should not have studied so hard. Non-Euclidean calculus and quantum physics are hard for any mind. Mixing them with folklore makes it worse. Tryign to find a strange, multi-dimensional truth behind the horror of the Gothic tales. The wild storise told by the fireplace is difficult. One cannot expect to be free from mental strain from that. Gilman came from Haverhill. Only after starting college in Arkham did he link his math to the old legends of magic. The atmosphere of the ancient town worked on his mind in unclear ways. The professors at Miskatonic told him to rest more. They reduced his course load in several areas. They also stopped him from reading certain old books. Thoes books were about frobidden secrets. They were kept locked in a vault in the university library.\n###\nBehind everything crouched the brooding, festering horror of the ancient town, and of the mouldy, unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed. His ears were growing sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable degree, and he had long ago stopped the cheap mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery. At night the subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house, were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium. The darkness always teemed with unexplained sound\u2014and yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other, fainter, noises which he suspected were lurking behind them. He was in the changeless, legend-haunted city of Arkham, with its clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the King\u2019s men in the dark, olden days of the Province. Nor was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured him\u2014for it was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old Keziah Mason, whose flight from Salem Gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain. That was in 1692\u2014the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small, white-fanged furry thing which scuttled out of Keziah\u2019s cell, and not even Cotton Mather could explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red, sticky fluid. Possibly Gilman ought not to have studied so hard. Non-Euclidean calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain; and when one mixes them with folklore, and tries to trace a strange background of multi-dimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the Gothic tales and the wild whispers of the chimney-corner, one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension. Gilman came from Haverhill, but it was only after he had entered college in Arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder magic. Something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his imagination. The professors at Miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points. Moreover, they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university library."}

It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \u201cThere was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eat\u2019g off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\u201d What did this signify? But wait\u2014was there not still another reference to \u201cguards\u201d in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had \u2018eaten their heads off\u2019, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \u201csalts\u201d to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could? So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \u201cMateria\u201d\u2014in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too\u2014and if not the salts of \u201cguards\u201d, then the salts of what? God!"}

Tiredness, because I had not slept for many days. My goal was strong, because I loved my home [THING] of Lomar. The marble [THING] of Olatho\u00eb that sits between the peaks of Noton. As I stood in the highest [THING] of the tower, I saw the horned shrinking [THING], red. Evil, shaking through the mists that hung over the far valley of Banof. Through a hole in the roof shone the pale Pole Star, moving as if alive. Looking like a devil. Methought its spirit whispered bad advice, calming me into traitorous sleepiness with a terrible rhythmic promise which it said again. Again: Vainly I fought against my sleepiness, trying to link these strange worsd with some [THING] knowledge I had learned from the Pnakotic writings. My [THING], heavy. Spinning, fell to my chest. When I next looked up it was in a dream. With the Pole Star smiling at me through a [THING] from beyond the horrible moving trees of a dream swamp. And I am still dreaming. In my shame. Hopelessness I sometimes scream wildly, begging the dream beings around me to wake me before the Inutos move up the path behind the peak Noton. Capture the fortress by surprise. These beings are demons, because they laugh at me. Say I am not dreaming. They make fun of me. The short yellow enemy may be moving quietly toward us. I have fialed in my duty and betrayed the marble [THING] of Olatho\u00eb. I have been false to Alos, my friend and leader. But still these shadows of my dream mock me. They say there is no land of Lomar, except in my night imaginations. They say that in those places where the Pole Star shines high. Red Aldebaran moves low around the horizon, there has been nothing. [THING] for thousands of years. They say there has never been a [THING] there except short yellow creatures, harmed by the cold, whom they call \" Esquimaux \". I have often wondered if most [THING] evre stop to tihnk about the sometimes huge importance of dreams. Of the hidden world to which they belong.\n###\nMy brain was sore dazed with excitement and fatigue, for I had not slept in many days; yet was my purpose firm, for I loved my native land of Lomar, and the marble city of Olatho\u00eb that lies betwixt the peaks of Noton and Kadiphonek. But as I stood in the tower\u2019s topmost chamber, I beheld the horned waning moon, red and sinister, quivering through the vapours that hovered over the distant valley of Banof. And through an opening in the roof glittered the pale Pole Star, fluttering as if alive, and leering like a fiend and tempter. Methought its spirit whispered evil counsel, soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over: Vainly did I struggle with my drowsiness, seeking to connect these strange words with some lore of the skies which I had learnt from the Pnakotic manuscripts. My head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast, and when next I looked up it was in a dream; with the Pole Star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of a dream-swamp. And I am still dreaming. In my shame and despair I sometimes scream frantically, begging the dream-creatures around me to waken me ere the Inutos steal up the pass behind the peak Noton and take the citadel by surprise; but these creatures are daemons, for they laugh at me and tell me I am not dreaming. They mock me whilst I sleep, and whilst the squat yellow foe may be creeping silently upon us. I have failed in my duty and betrayed the marble city of Olatho\u00eb; I have proven false to Alos, my friend and commander. But still these shadows of my dream deride me. They say there is no land of Lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the Pole Star shines high and red Aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call \u201cEsquimaux\u201d. I have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which they belong."}

They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together.

Around the base was an inscription in characters which neither St. John nor I could identify; and on the bottom, like a maker\u2019s seal, was graven a grotesque and formidable skull. Immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it; that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave. Even had its outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it, but as we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar. Alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know, but we recognised it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; the ghastly soul-symbol of the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible Leng, in Central Asia. All too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old Arab daemonologist; lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead. Seizing the green jade object, we gave a last glance at the bleached and cavern-eyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it. As we hastened from that abhorrent spot, the stolen amulet in St. John\u2019s pocket, we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the earth we had so lately rifled, as if seeking for some cursed and unholy nourishment. But the autumn moon shone weak and pale, and we could not be sure. So, too, as we sailed the next day away from Holland to our home, we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background. But the autumn wind moaned sad and wan, and we could not be sure. Less than a week after our return to England, strange things began to happen. We lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor-house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor. Now, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be frequent fumblings in the night, not only around the doors but around the windows also, upper as well as lower. Once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off."}

The man, after picknig up the book I had been reading, waving to me as he pulled his hood over that face. Amid these crowds I followed my guides. Pushed by elbows that seemed. Pressed by chests. Stomachs that seemed. But seeing a face and hearing a word. Up,, up the lines of people moved. I saw that all the travelers were coming as they flowed near a sort of center of alleys at the top of a hill in the middle of the town, where a church stood. I had seen it from the road 's top when I looked at Kingsport in the dusk. It had made me because Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the spire.

This was not much, though, for the old woman was spinning very hard, and the aged clock had been striking. After that I lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle, and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume, and sat down on that very bench, so that I could not see him. It was certainly nervous waiting, and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so. When eleven struck, however, the old man stood up, glided to a massive carved chest in a corner, and got two hooded cloaks; one of which he donned, and the other of which he draped round the old woman, who was ceasing her monotonous spinning. Then they both started for the outer door; the woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after picking up the very book I had been reading, beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or mask. Amid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by elbows that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and hearing never a word. Up, up, up the eerie columns slithered, and I saw that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town, where perched a great white church. I had seen it from the road\u2019s crest when I looked at Kingsport in the new dusk, and it had made me shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spire. There was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with spectral shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the tombs, revealing gruesome vistas, though queerly failing to cast any shadows. Past the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see over the hill\u2019s summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the town was invisible in the dark. Only once in a while a lanthorn bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church."}

When he came to watch those who had left the old customs, he found tehm even more miserable than those who had not. They did not know that happiness lies in order. They did not know that the rightness of one's clothes has no meainng in a careless world. Its only meaning is its match with the hopes and the traditions that came before. These blindly shaped our small habits from the bigger confusion. They did not see that tidiness. Wrinkle, are only passing results of custom. Tehir only value lies in their link to what chance made our ancestors think was acceptable. Their finer differences are not the same for every office and evnet. Instead, they either laughed at these things completely. Pushed them to the rough, unclear urges they shared with messy animals. Uncaring office workers. So tehir clothes were pulled around smelling bad in neglect, spot, and untidiness. They were filled with a ridiculous pride at having run away from something no less unreasonable than what still held them. They had traded the false gods of very careful keeping for those of laziness.\n###\nBut when he came to observe those who had abandoned the old rituals, he found them even more wretched than those who had not. They did not know that satisfaction lies in order, and that the propriety of one\u2019s attire has no meaning amidst a careless world save only its alignment with the expectations and the customs which have gone before and blindly shaped our small routines out of the greater tumult. They did not see that neatness and disarray, crispness and rumple, are but transient fruits of convention, whose sole worth lies in their connection to what accident made our forebears deem presentable, and whose subtler distinctions are different for every office and occasion. Instead, they either scorned these things altogether or relegated them to the crude, vague impulses which they shared with slovenly beasts and indifferent clerks; so that their garments were dragged malodorously about in neglect, stain, and dishevelment, yet filled with a ludicrous pride at having escaped from something no more irrational than that which still constrained them. They had traded the false idols of fastidious care for those of sloth and anarchy."}

In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports and its sinister \u201cpurgation\u201d, but he found something calming about the doctor\u2019s letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke. \u201cDear Theodore:\u2014I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of), but I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is. \u201cYou have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charles\u2019s case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyone\u2019s mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name. I\u2019d advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am going South for a while to calm down and brace up. \u201cSo don\u2019t ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go wrong, but I\u2019ll tell you if it does. I don\u2019t think it will. There will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now\u2014safer than you dream. You need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the past as Joseph Curwen\u2019s picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person."}

Around the creature 's neck was a chain. It held an locket with coat of arms designs. This was some traveler 's keepsake. The N\u2019bangus took it and hung it on the goddess as a charm. Commenting on the mummy 's face shape, M. Verhaeren made a comparison. Or, he wondered how it would affect his correspondent. But he was to waste words on jokes. He wrote that the preserved goddess would arrive packed about a month after getting the letter. The object was delivered at Jermyn House on the afternoon of August 3, 1913. It was taken to the room. This room held the collection of specimens arranged by Sir Robert and Arthur. What happened is known from servants ' stories. Papers checked. Of stories, Soames the family butler 's is the and. According According to this man, Sir Arthur Jermyn sent everyone out of the room before opening the box. But the sound of hammer and chisel showed he did not wait. Sounds Nothing were heard for some time. Soames can not say how. But than fifteen minutes, a scream was heard. It was Jermyn 's voice. Jermyn came out of the room. He rushed toward the front of the house as if chased by a enemy. The look on his faec was. His face was when. Near the door he seemed to think of something. He turned in his escape. He went down the stairs to the cellar and disappeared. The servants were. They watched at the top of the stairs. Their master did not come. A smell of oil was all that came from. After, a rattling came from the door connecting the cellar to the yard. A - boy saw Arthur Jermyn. He was shining from head to foot with oil and smelled of it. He sneaked out and disappeared onto the moor around the house.\n###\nWhether it was human or simian only a scientist could determine, and the process of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition. Time and the Congo climate are not kind to mummies; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here. Around the creature\u2019s neck had been found a golden chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs; no doubt some hapless traveller\u2019s keepsake, taken by the N\u2019bangus and hung upon the goddess as a charm. In commenting on the contour of the mummy\u2019s face, M. Verhaeren suggested a whimsical comparison; or rather, expressed a humorous wonder just how it would strike his correspondent, but was too much interested scientifically to waste many words in levity. The stuffed goddess, he wrote, would arrive duly packed about a month after receipt of the letter. The boxed object was delivered at Jermyn House on the afternoon of August 3, 1913, being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which housed the collection of African specimens as arranged by Sir Robert and Arthur. What ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and papers later examined. Of the various tales that of aged Soames, the family butler, is most ample and coherent. According to this trustworthy man, Sir Arthur Jermyn dismissed everyone from the room before opening the box, though the instant sound of hammer and chisel shewed that he did not delay the operation. Nothing was heard for some time; just how long Soames cannot exactly estimate; but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the horrible scream, undoubtedly in Jermyn\u2019s voice, was heard. Immediately afterward Jermyn emerged from the room, rushing frantically toward the front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy. The expression on his face, a face ghastly enough in repose, was beyond description. When near the front door he seemed to think of something, and turned back in his flight, finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar. The servants were utterly dumbfounded, and watched at the head of the stairs, but their master did not return. A smell of oil was all that came up from the regions below. After dark a rattling was heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard; and a stable-boy saw Arthur Jermyn, glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of that fluid, steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor surrounding the house."}

On the morning of July 2, we saw a warship flying American colors. The men bceame very agitated and wanted to surrender. Finally Lieut. Klenze had to shoot a sailor named Traube. He argued for this un-German act very violently. This calmed the crew for a while. We dove without being seen. The next afternoon, a thick group of seabirsd came from the south. The ocean began to swell in a threatening way. Closing our hatches, we waited to see what would happen. We realized we must dive or be flooded by the rising waves. Our air pressure and electricity were getting low. We wanted to avoid all unnecsesary use of our limited resources. But in this case, we had no choice. We did not go donw far. After several hours, the sea was calmer. We decided to go back to the surface. Here, a new problem happened. The ship did not respond to our controls. The mechanics could not fix it. As the men gerw more scared of this underwater prison, some began to mutter again about Lieut. Klenze's ivory statue. The sight of an automatic pistol calmed them. We kept the poor men as busy as possible. We worked on the machinery even when we knew it was pointless. Klenze and I usaully slept at different times. During my sleep, around 5 A.M. On July 4, a full mutiny started. The six remaining pig-like sailors thought we were lost. They suddenly became furiously angry. They were angry we refused to surrender to the Yankee battleship two days before. They were in a frenzy of cursing and breaking things. They roared like animals. They broke instruments and furniture without car.e They screamed about nonsense. They talked of the ivory statue's curse. The dark dead youth who looked at them. Lieut. Klenze seemed frozen and useless. One might expect that from a soft, womanish Rhinelander. I shot all six men. It was necessary. I made sure none were alive. We pushed the bodies out through the dobule hatches. We were alone in the U-29. Klenze seemed very anxious and drank a lot. We decided to stay alive as long as we could. We would use the large supply of food and chemical oxygen. None of it was damaged by the crazy actions of those swine-dog sailors.\n###\nDolphins still encircled the U-29, a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the distance we had covered. On the morning of July 2 we sighted a warship flying American colours, and the men became very restless in their desire to surrender. Finally Lieut. Klenze had to shoot a seaman named Traube, who urged this un-German act with especial violence. This quieted the crew for the time, and we submerged unseen. The next afternoon a dense flock of sea-birds appeared from the south, and the ocean began to heave ominously. Closing our hatches, we awaited developments until we realised that we must either submerge or be swamped in the mounting waves. Our air pressure and electricity were diminishing, and we wished to avoid all unnecessary use of our slender mechanical resources; but in this case there was no choice. We did not descend far, and when after several hours the sea was calmer, we decided to return to the surface. Here, however, a new trouble developed; for the ship failed to respond to our direction in spite of all that the mechanics could do. As the men grew more frightened at this undersea imprisonment, some of them began to mutter again about Lieut. Klenze\u2019s ivory image, but the sight of an automatic pistol calmed them. We kept the poor devils as busy as we could, tinkering at the machinery even when we knew it was useless. Klenze and I usually slept at different times; and it was during my sleep, about 5 A.M., July 4, that the general mutiny broke loose. The six remaining pigs of seamen, suspecting that we were lost, had suddenly burst into a mad fury at our refusal to surrender to the Yankee battleship two days before; and were in a delirium of cursing and destruction. They roared like the animals they were, and broke instruments and furniture indiscriminately; screaming about such nonsense as the curse of the ivory image and the dark dead youth who looked at them and swam away. Lieut. Klenze seemed paralysed and inefficient, as one might expect of a soft, womanish Rhinelander. I shot all six men, for it was necessary, and made sure that none remained alive. We expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the U-29. Klenze seemed very nervous, and drank heavily. It was decided that we remain alive as long as possible, using the large stock of provisions and chemical supply of oxygen, none of which had suffered from the crazy antics of those swine-hound seamen."}

While Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to Dr. Allen, which Mr. Ward had ordered delivered at the family home. Willett had predicted that very little would be found, since any communications of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger; but in the latter part of March there did come a letter from Prague for Dr. Allen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought. It was in a very crabbed and archaic hand; and though clearly not the effort of a foreigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from modern English as the speech of young Ward himself. It read: I this day receiv\u2019d yr mention of what came up from the Salts I sent you. It was wrong, and meanes clearly that ye Headstones had been chang\u2019d when Barnabas gott me the Specimen.

Past the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see over the hill 's top. Watch the shine of stars on the harbor, though the town was in the dark. in a. A lantern moved through winding alleys on its way to catch up with the crowd that was slipping into the church. I waited till the crowd had flowed into the doorway. Till all the stragglers had followed. The man was pulling at my sleeve. I was to be the. I went, the man and the spinning woman before me. Crossing the doorway into that temple of darkness, I turned to look at the world as the churchyard glow cast a light on the hill - top pavement. And as I did I shuddered. For though the wind had not left snow, a patches did remain on the path near the door. In that look it seemed to my eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet, not mine. The church was lighted by all the lanterns that had entered it, for of the crowd had disappeared. They had moved up the aisle between the pews to the trap - door of vaults which hung before the pulpit. Were wriggling in. I followed down the steps and into the damp, choking room. The end of that twisting line of night - walkers seemed. As I saw them squirming into an tomb they seemed. I noticed that the tomb 's floor had an opening down which the crowd was sliding. In a moment we were all going down a staircase of - cut stone. A staircase damp., that wound into the depths of the hill past walls of dripping stone blocks. It was a, descent. I noticed after a time that the walls. Steps were changing in nature, as if cut out of the rock. What bothered me was that the footsteps made no sound. Created no echoes. After ages of descent I saw some side passages. Tunnels leading from spaces of blackness to this shaft of mystery.\n###\nPast the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see over the hill\u2019s summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the town was invisible in the dark. Only once in a while a lanthorn bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church. I waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway, and till all the stragglers had followed. The old man was pulling at my sleeve, but I was determined to be the last. Then I finally went, the sinister man and the old spinning woman before me. Crossing the threshold into that swarming temple of unknown darkness, I turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hill-top pavement. And as I did so I shuddered. For though the wind had not left much snow, a few patches did remain on the path near the door; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet, not even mine. The church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it, for most of the throng had already vanished. They had streamed up the aisle between the high white pews to the trap-door of the vaults which yawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit, and were now squirming noiselessly in. I followed dumbly down the footworn steps and into the dank, suffocating crypt. The tail of that sinuous line of night-marchers seemed very horrible, and as I saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still. Then I noticed that the tomb\u2019s floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding, and in a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of rough-hewn stone; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous, that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar. It was a silent, shocking descent, and I observed after a horrible interval that the walls and steps were changing in nature, as if chiselled out of the solid rock. What mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and set up no echoes. After more aeons of descent I saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery."}

He had usually slept at night longer than the normal time. Upon waking he would often talk of unknown things in a way. Odd as to cause fear even in the hearts of an unimagining population. Not that his form of language was unusual at all, for he never spoke except in the low local speech of his surroundings. Content of his speech were of such mysterious wildness, that no one could listen without worry. He himself was generally as scared and confused as his listeners. Within an hour after waking he would forget all that he had said. At least all that had caused him to say what he did. He would fall back into a cow-like, half-friendly normal state like that of the other hill people. As Slater he grew older, it appeared, his morning strange behaviors had slowly increased in how often they happened. How strong they were. Then about a month before his arrival at the hospital occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities. One day near noon, after a deep sleep started in a whiskey drinking party at about five the previous afternoon, the man had woken himself most suddenly. He made howls. Unearthly that they brought several neihgbors to his cabin\u2014a dirty pigsty where he lived with a family as hard to describe as himself. Rushing out into the sonw, he had thrown his arms up high. Started a series of jumps straight up into the air. Doing this he shouted his decision to reach some 'big, great cabin with brightness in the roof. The luod strange music far away.' As two men of average size treid to hold him back, he had fought with insane strength. He screamed of his wish. Need to find. Kill a certain 'thing that shines. Finally, after knocking down one of the men holding him for a short time with a sudden hit, he had thrown himself upon the othre in a devilish joy of blood thirst. He shrieked like a fiend that he woudl 'jump high in the air. Burn his way through anything that stopped him'. Family and neighbors had now run away in a panic. When the braver of them returned, Slater was gone.

Rushing out into the snow, he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air; the while shouting his determination to reach some \u2018big, big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor, and the loud queer music far away\u2019. As two men of moderate size sought to restrain him, he had struggled with maniacal force and fury, screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain \u2018thing that shines and shakes and laughs\u2019.

All the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter, bringing to the minds of the huddled men a sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could form. It was no longer shining out, it was pouring out; and as the shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow directly into the sky. The veterinary shivered, and walked to the front door to drop the heavy extra bar across it. Ammi shook no less, and had to tug and point for lack of a controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the growing luminosity of the trees. The neighing and stamping of the horses had become utterly frightful, but not a soul of that group in the old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward. With the moments the shining of the trees increased, while their restless branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality. The wood of the well-sweep was shining now, and presently a policeman dumbly pointed to some wooden sheds and bee-hives near the stone wall on the west. They were commencing to shine, too, though the tethered vehicles of the visitors seemed so far unaffected. Then there was a wild commotion and clopping in the road, and as Ammi quenched the lamp for better seeing they realised that the span of frantic greys had broke their sapling and run off with the democrat-wagon. The shock served to loosen several tongues, and embarrassed whispers were exchanged. \u201cIt spreads on everything organic that\u2019s been around here,\u201d muttered the medical examiner.

It was\u2014something I found in my coat the next morning. You know, the curled-up paper tacked to that frightful canvas in the cellar; the thing I thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster.

Yes, that paper was the reason I dropped Pickman; Richard Upton Pickman, the greatest artist I have ever known\u2014and the foulest being that ever leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness. Eliot\u2014old Reid was right. He wasn\u2019t strictly human. Either he was born in strange shadow, or he\u2019d found a way to unlock the forbidden gate.

There are secrets, you know, which might have come down from old Salem times, and Cotton Mather tells even stranger things. You know how damned life-like Pickman\u2019s paintings were\u2014how we all wondered where he got those faces. Well\u2014that paper wasn\u2019t a photograph of any background, after all. What it shewed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas. It was the model he was using\u2014and its background was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail. But by God, Eliot, it was a photograph from life. When Randolph Carter was thirty he lost the key of the gate of dreams. Prior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly excursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space, and lovely, unbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age hardened upon him he felt these liberties slipping away little by little, until at last he was cut off altogether."}

Shortly after the flood, amidst the varied reports of hardship, suffering, and organised relief which filled the press, there appeared certain odd stories of things found floating in some of the swollen rivers; so that many of my friends embarked on curious discussions and appealed to me to shed what light I could on the subject.

Of course many of the stray items mentioned other instances, but on analysis they all seemed to boil down to these three. In each case country folk reported seeing one or more very bizarre and disturbing objects in the surging waters that poured down from the unfrequented hills, and there was a widespread tendency to connect these sights with a primitive, half-forgotten cycle of whispered legend which old people resurrected for the occasion. What people thought they saw were organic shapes not quite like any they had ever seen before. Naturally, there were many human bodies washed along by the streams in that tragic period; but those who described these strange shapes felt quite sure that they were not human, despite some superficial resemblances in size and general outline. Nor, said the witnesses, could they have been any kind of animal known to Vermont. They were pinkish things about five feet long; with crustaceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or membraneous wings and several sets of articulated limbs, and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with multitudes of very short antennae, where a head would ordinarily be."}

One moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place, and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been well-nigh vertical. Of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure, but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy. Then he realised he was still, with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him. All around were crumbling walls and broken columns, and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots. Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come."}

They tried to SET up secret stations in the human world. There were tales of strange claw marks found naer farmhouse windows in the morning. There were occasional disappearances in areas not known to be haunteed. Tales also told of buzzing voices copying human speech. These voices made surprising offers to lone travelers on roads in the deep woods. Children were terrified by things seen. Heard whhere the ancient forest came near their homes. The newest layer of legends came just before people stopped believing in superstitions. They stopped going near the feared places. These legends tell of shocked mentions of hermits and remote farmers. These people seemed to have a disgusting change of mind at some point in their lives. People avoided them and whispered about them. They were said to have sold themselves to the strange beings. In ONE northeastern county around 1800, it became common to blame odd and disliked loners. They were accused of being friends or agents of the hated things.\n###\nBut while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men, and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world. There were tales of the queer claw-prints seen around farmhouse windows in the morning, and of occasional disappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas. Tales, besides, of buzzing voices in imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travellers on roads and cart-paths in the deep woods, and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their dooryards. In the final layer of legends\u2014the layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close contact with the dreaded places\u2014there are shocked references to hermits and remote farmers who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change, and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings. In one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred things."}

Examining one day the reserve specimens, my eye was caught by an picture. The specimens were roughly set on the storage shelves. They were in a rear room of the museum.

It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp. Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows: MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA. Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow. One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow. The Morrison Co.\u2019s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34\u00b0 21', W. Longitude 152\u00b0 17' with one living and one dead man aboard. The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern. This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men."}

They were also told about my Stubborn demand for a firstlook at the loaf. This was before our complete move to the meal. It seems I had thought a lot. With worryingly picky fear, about that grainy mark on crsut. I saw in it some conflicts in freshness and cooking time. This sharpened my disgust to the highest point. It made me not want to try mroe cutting. Chewing on the table-spreading food that the shown pieces clearly made. I was oddly sure the texture was the leftover of some sad, unknown. Completely unclassifiable process of major decay. This was even though the bread that had it was from a very baking\u2014a day if not actually from before dawn. This made it unlikely to have any tasty softness. Any wetness above the dried-out. At most leathery stage. These pieces, with their feel, must have been five days to a week\n###\nThe outside world knew, of course, of our luncheon, and was told also of my strange and dogged insistence on a preliminary\u2014or rather, preprandial\u2014inspection of the loaf before our radical shift to the repast. It seems I had pondered a great deal, and with alarmingly fastidious dread, over that peculiar granular marking upon the crust; reading into it certain contradictions in freshness and culinary period which whetted my revulsion to the utmost, and made me loath to attempt more cuttings and mastication in the table-stretching aliment which the exposed fragments evidently composed. I was strangely convinced that the texture was the vestige of some dismal, unknown, and radically unclassifiable process of considerable decay, notwithstanding that the bread which bore it was of so vastly antique a baking\u2014day-old if not actually pre-dawn\u2014as to preclude the probable existence not only of all palatable softness, but of any moisture at all above the desiccated or at most the leathery stage. These fragments, with their odd consistency, must have been five days to a full week old."}

My knowledge of the thing started in the winter of 1926\u201327. It began with the death of my great-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brwon Universtiy, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known as an expert on ancient writings. The heads of important museums often asked for his help. So many people may remember his death at age ninety-two. Local interest grew because the cause of death was unclear. Thhe professor had been struck while returning from the Newport boat. He fell suddenly, as witnesses spoke. This happened after a sailor-looking blackk man bumped into him. The man came from one of the odd dark allesy on the steep hillside. This path was a shortcut from the waterfront to the dead man's home in Williams Street. Doctors could not find any visiblle problem. But after confused discussion, they decided an unclear heart injury was the cause. They thought the fast climb up such a steep hill by such an old man led to his death. At the time, I saw no reason to disagree with this opinion. But lately, I am inclined to doubt it, and more thann just doubt.\n###\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926\u201327 with the death of my grand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.

Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end.

But Willett opened the pits. At the time, the connected idea in his mind was an paragraph from some Curwen information he had read. It was a phrase used by Simon.

He drifted into a mixed - up memory chant like Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot., he went to the - repeated two - part formula he had foudn in Ward 's library: \" Y'ai ' ng'ngah, Yog - Sothoth, \". On until the \" Zhro. \" It seemed to calm him. After a time, he staggered to his feet. He regretted his fear - lost torch. Looked for any gleam of light in the blackness of the air. He would not go. He strained his eyes in every direction for some glimmer. Reflection of the light he had left in the library. After a while, he thought he detected a hint of a glow. Towadr this he crawled with caution on hands. Knees through the stench. He felt. He would not hit the pillars. Fall into the pit he had uncovered., his shaking fingers touched something he knew must be the steps leading to the altar. He pulled from this spot in disgust.

At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: \u201cCertainely, there was Noth\u2019g butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. rais\u2019d upp from What he cou\u2019d gather onlie a part of.\u201d Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about. These words hummed in the doctor\u2019s mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lord\u2019s Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in Ward\u2019s underground library: \u201cY\u2019ai \u2019ng\u2019ngah, Yog-Sothoth\u201d, and so on till the final underlined \u201cZhro\u201d. It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered. Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him."}

Again there were only the desert. The bad [THING]. The pieces of a past no one could guess. I moved close and stopped. I shone the added light of my electric torch over the fallen pile. A small hill had blown away. It left a low, roughly round mass of large stones and smaller pieces. It was about forty feet across and from two to eight feet high. From the very start I realized these stones had some completely new quality. Not only was the number of them without equal. Something in the sand - worn traces of design stopped me as I looked at them under the mixed light of the [THING]. It was not that any one block was very different from the earlier ones we found. It was something less obvious. The feeling did not come when I seemed at one block alone. It only came when I looked over several almost at the same time. Then, at last, I understood the truth. The curved patterns on many of these blocks were closely connected. They were parts of one huge decorative idea. For the first time in this age - shaken waste, I had found a mass of masonry in its old position. It was fallen and broken, true. But it still existed in a very clear way. Mounting at a low place, I climbed with effort over the heap. Here and there I cleared away sand with my fingers. I kept trying to understand the different sizes, shapes, and styles. I tried to understand the relationships of the designs. After a while I could vaugely guess the nature of the old structure. I could guess at the designs that once covered the huge surfaces of the ancient masonry. The perfect match of the whole with some glimpses from my dreams frightened. This was once a Cyclopean hall thirty feet tall. It was paved with eight - sided blocks and had a solid arched roof. There would have been rooms opening off on the right. At the far end, one of those strange sloped paths would have wound down to even lower depths. I jumped as these ideas came to me. There was more in them than the blocks themselves had given. How did I know this level should have been far underground?\n###\nIt was the largest group in one place that I had so far seen, and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away. Again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an unguessed past. I drew close and paused, and cast the added light of my electric torch over the tumbled pile. A hillock had blown away, leaving a low, irregularly round mass of megaliths and smaller fragments some forty feet across and from two to eight feet high. From the very outset I realised that there was some utterly unprecedented quality about these stones. Not only was the mere number of them quite without parallel, but something in the sand-worn traces of design arrested me as I scanned them under the mingled beams of the moon and my torch. Not that any one differed essentially from the earlier specimens we had found. It was something subtler than that. The impression did not come when I looked at one block alone, but only when I ran my eye over several almost simultaneously. Then, at last, the truth dawned upon me. The curvilinear patterns on many of these blocks were closely related\u2014parts of one vast decorative conception. For the first time in this aeon-shaken waste I had come upon a mass of masonry in its old position\u2014tumbled and fragmentary, it is true, but none the less existing in a very definite sense. Mounting at a low place, I clambered laboriously over the heap; here and there clearing away the sand with my fingers, and constantly striving to interpret varieties of size, shape, and style, and relationships of design. After a while I could vaguely guess at the nature of the bygone structure, and at the designs which had once stretched over the vast surfaces of the primal masonry. The perfect identity of the whole with some of my dream-glimpses appalled and unnerved me. This was once a Cyclopean corridor thirty feet tall, paved with octagonal blocks and solidly vaulted overhead. There would have been rooms opening off on the right, and at the farther end one of those strange inclined planes would have wound down to still lower depths. I started violently as these conceptions occurred to me, for there was more in them than the blocks themselves had supplied. How did I know that this level should have been far underground?"}

All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was a tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house; but I may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their recurrence through many reports from diverse sources. For example, the servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungous and malodorous cellar of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence. There had been servants\u2014Ann White especially\u2014who would not use the cellar kitchen, and at least three well-defined legends bore upon the queer quasi-human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree-roots and patches of mould in that region.

There were rat bones chewed by teeth in a way. of argument. objects found included the pieces of books and papers. There was a dust left from the breaking down of books. All, without exception, appeared to deal with magic in its. The date of items is a mystery. It is as that of the bones. An mystery is the sameness of the cramped, - writing found on a range of papers. Their conditions and watermarks suggest age differences of 150 to 200 years. To some,, the mystery of all is the variety of objects. Their shapes, materials, types of workmanship, and purposes confuse all guesswork. They were found scattered among the wreckage in states of damage. One of these thingsis a damaged monster. It resembles the statue that Gilman gave to college museum. But it is, made of some stone of metal. It has a angled base with symbols. Anthroploogists are trying to explain the designs on a bowl of metal. Its side had threatening stains when found. Foreigners and believing.\n###\nCareful sifting of debris also disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the collapse, as well as older rat-bones gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and then highly productive of controversy and reflection. Other objects found included the mingled fragments of many books and papers, together with a yellowish dust left from the total disintegration of still older books and papers. All, without exception, appeared to deal with black magic in its most advanced and horrible forms; and the evidently recent date of certain items is still a mystery as unsolved as that of the modern human bones. An even greater mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed, archaic writing found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest age differences of at least 150 to 200 years. To some, though, the greatest mystery of all is the variety of utterly inexplicable objects\u2014objects whose shapes, materials, types of workmanship, and purposes baffle all conjecture\u2014found scattered amidst the wreckage in evidently diverse states of injury. One of these things\u2014which excited several Miskatonic professors profoundly\u2014is a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which Gilman gave to the college museum, save that it is larger, wrought of some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal, and possessed of a singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphics. Archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous brownish stains when found. Foreigners and credulous grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by Joe Mazurewicz as that which he had given poor Gilman many years before. Some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by rats, while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner of Gilman\u2019s old room all the time. Still others, including Joe himself, have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credence. When the slanting wall of Gilman\u2019s room was torn out, the once sealed triangular space between that partition and the house\u2019s north wall was found to contain much less structural debris, even in proportion to its size, than the room itself; though it had a ghastly layer of older materials which paralysed the wreckers with horror. In brief, the floor was a veritable ossuary of the bones of small children\u2014some fairly modern, but others extending back in infinite gradations to a period so remote that crumbling was almost complete."}

Complete of home records. It was joined to a gravity pull which would have made it an easy. A light weight if it had not been mixed into strange. The laundry worker, who was the home's house judge, states that the basket's visible spac,e as measured by its size outside the area of its fullness, had really become smaller since the piling up. holder, it is true, was always a pot and a holder. Even its most roomy early use did not show the amazing thickness. Weight displayed during its final weighing by the confused watchers. It was, truly, hard task to get a practical carrying out from the room. The woven shape seemed so heavy and unmoving. Only based on the story of others. On the proof of many unusual bulges in its pile of cloths as different from its frame, was it finally raised toward the washing area. Right up to the time of its moving, it was an all-eating gatherer. As great a trial of strength as its weak handles allowed. Smart carriers, not able to guess its final splitting, openly said that it would not be long in falling to the unavoidable spreading of its things.\n###\nPhysically, too, the laden basket was unique. Its burden held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the most mundane and exhaustive of domestic chronicles, and was conjoined to a gravitational pull which would have made it a manageable or a trivial load had it not been compounded into strange and onerous forms. The laundress, who was the household\u2019s domestic arbiter, affirms that the basket\u2019s apparent capacity, as gauged by its dimensions outside the sphere of its fullness, had actually decreased since the accumulation. The receptacle, it is true, was always a vessel and a container; but even its most capacious early service did not shew the prodigious density and mass displayed during its final weighing by the perplexed observers. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a practical removal from the chamber, so ponderous and immobile did the woven form seem; and only on the testimony of others, and on the strength of many abnormal protuberances in its stock of fabrics as distinguished from its structure, was it finally lifted towards the cleansing area. To the very moment of its conveyance it was an omnivorous accumulator and as great a test of fortitude as its frail handles permitted; and shrewd bearers, failing to foresee its eventual division, freely predicted that it would not be long in succumbing to the inevitable dispersal of its contents."}

The ship tied up there while the captain did business in the taverns. Carter also went onto land. He looked with interest at the rough streets. Wooden ox-carts moved slowly there. Excited merchants shouted about their goods in the markets. The sea taverns were all near the docks on sotne streets. The streets were salty from tide spray. The taverns looked very They had ceilings with black beams. Their windows had greenish glass with centers. sailors in those taverns talked a lot about faraway ports. They told many stories about the men from the dim Inganok. But they added to what the ship's own sailors had said. Finally, after much loading and unloading, the ship sailed again on the sunset sea. The walls and roofs of Hlanith grew smaller. The last golden daylight gave them a wonder. Beauty greater than any people gave them. The ship sailed for two nights and two days over the Cerenerian Sea. It saw no ladn and met only one other ship. Near sunset on the second day, the snowy top of Aran appeared ahead. Ginkgo trees swayed on its lower slopes. Carter knew they had reached the land of Ooth-Nargai and the amazing city of Celepha\u00efs. Soon the shining towers of that fabled town came into view. They saw the perfect marble walls with their bornze statues. They saw the stone bridge where Naraxa meets the sea. Then the green, gentle hills behind the town rose up. They had groves and gardens of asphodel flower.s They had shrines and cottages on them. Far in distance was the purple line of Tanarians. It looked powerful and mystical. Behind it were forbidden paths to the waking world and to other dream regions. The harbor was of painted ships. Some came from the marble cloud-city of Serannian. That city lies in the air where the sea meets the sky. Some came from more solid ports on the dreamland oceans. Among these, the pilot steered his way to the spice-smelling docks. The ship tied up at dusk. The city's million lights began to twinkle over the water. This eternal city of dreams seemed very Here, time cannot damage or destroy anything.\n###\nThe wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox-carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars. The sea-taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salt with the spray of high tides, and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and casements of greenish bull\u2019s-eye panes. Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports, and told many stories of the curious men from twilight Inganok, but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told. Then, at last, after much unloading and loading, the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea, and the high walls and gables of Hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them. Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea, sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel. Then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of Aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the lower slopes, and Carter knew that they were come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and the marvellous city of Celepha\u00efs. Swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town, and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues, and the great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea. Then rose the green gentle hills behind the town, with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the purple ridge of the Tanarians, potent and mystical, behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream. The harbour was full of painted galleys, some of which were from the marble cloud-city of Serannian, that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky, and some of which were from more substantial ports on the oceans of dreamland. Among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spice-fragrant wharves, where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the city\u2019s million lights began to twinkle out over the water. Ever new seemed this deathless city of vision, for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy."}

I heard a crashing sound I recognized. It was the thunder of the mountain, raised to fury. I must have been crawling for some time. The surface was. And as the muffled thunder crahsed, those eyes stared with viciousness. Thank God I did not know what it was, or I should have died. But I was saved by the thunder that had called it. After a wait, one of those mountain bolts burst from the sky. I had noticed its aftermath. as gashes of disturbed earth. Glassy rocks of sizes. In its rage it tore through the soil above that pit. It blinded and deafened me but did not knock me out. In the chaos of sliding, shifting earth I clawed and struggled. The rain on my head steadied me. I saw I had come to the surface in a spot. It was a, place on the slope of the mounatin. sheet lightning lit up the ground. The remains of mound. Thta mound had stretched down from the wooded slope. There was nothing in the chaos to show my place of exit from the tomb. My brain was a chaos as the earth. A glare burst on the landscape from the south. I realized the horror I had been through. When two days the squatters told me what the glare meant, I felt horror than the mold - burrow. Eyes had given. It was horror because of the meanings. In a village twenty miles, an orgy of fear had followed the bolt that brought me above ground. A nameless thing had dropped from an overhanging tree into a cabin with a roof. It had done a deed. But the squatters had fired the cabin in a frenzy before it could escape. It had been doing that deed at the moment the earth caved in on the tihng with the claw. There can be nothing in the mind of one who, knowing what I knew of the horrors of Tempest Mountain, would seek for the fear that hid.\n###\nI stopped automatically, though lacking the brain to retreat. The eyes approached, yet of the thing that bore them I could distinguish only a claw. But what a claw! Then far overhead I heard a faint crashing which I recognised. It was the wild thunder of the mountain, raised to hysteric fury\u2014I must have been crawling upward for some time, so that the surface was now quite near. And as the muffled thunder clattered, those eyes still stared with vacuous viciousness. Thank God I did not then know what it was, else I should have died. But I was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it, for after a hideous wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those frequent mountainward bolts whose aftermath I had noticed here and there as gashes of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes. With Cyclopean rage it tore through the soil above that damnable pit, blinding and deafening me, yet not wholly reducing me to a coma. In the chaos of sliding, shifting earth I clawed and floundered helplessly till the rain on my head steadied me and I saw that I had come to the surface in a familiar spot; a steep unforested place on the southwest slope of the mountain. Recurrent sheet lightnings illumed the tumbled ground and the remains of the curious low hummock which had stretched down from the wooded higher slope, but there was nothing in the chaos to shew my place of egress from the lethal catacomb. My brain was as great a chaos as the earth, and as a distant red glare burst on the landscape from the south I hardly realised the horror I had been through. But when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare meant, I felt more horror than that which the mould-burrow and the claw and eyes had given; more horror because of the overwhelming implications. In a hamlet twenty miles away an orgy of fear had followed the bolt which brought me above ground, and a nameless thing had dropped from an overhanging tree into a weak-roofed cabin. It had done a deed, but the squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it could escape. It had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyes. There can be nothing normal in the mind of one who, knowing what I knew of the horrors of Tempest Mountain, would seek alone for the fear that lurked there."}

Olney walked out along the cliffs to where the cliff jumped up to be with things. He became that no feet could climb up. Go down that overhanging slope. To the south and north it rose thousands of feet from the water. the side, and toward Arkham, remained. One morning in August Olney he set out to find a path to the peak. He worked along roads. He went past Hooper 's Pond. The brick powder - house to where the pastures slope up to the ridge above the Miskatonic. This gvae a view of Arkham 's church towers across miles of river. he found a road to Arkham. No trail in the seaward direction he wanted. Woods and fields crowded up to the bank of river 's mouth. They bore no sign of presence. Not a stone wall or a cow. There was grass. Tangles of bushes that the might have seen. As he climbed,. above the river mouth on his left. Nearer the sea, he found the way growing. He wondeerd how the people living in that disliked place managed to reach the world. He wondered if they came to market in Arkham. the trees became. below him on his right he saw the hills. Spires of Kingsport. Central Hill looked like a dwarf from this height. He could make out the graveyard by the Congregational Hospital. Rumour said some caves or tunnels hid beneath it. lay grass and blueberry bushes. Beyond them was the rock of the cliff. The peak of the feared cottage. the ridge became. Olney grew from his loneliness in the sky. of him was the cliff above Kingsport. Norht of him was the drop of a mile to the river 's mouth. a crack opened before him. It was ten feet. He had to lower himself by his hands and drop to a floor. he had to crawl up a passage in the wall.\n###\nProbably they traded in Arkham, knowing how little Kingsport liked their habitation, or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. Olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things, and became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on that beetling southern slope. East and north it rose thousands of feet vertically from the water, so only the western side, inland and toward Arkham, remained. One early morning in August Olney set out to find a path to the inaccessible pinnacle. He worked northwest along pleasant back roads, past Hooper\u2019s Pond and the old brick powder-house to where the pastures slope up to the ridge above the Miskatonic and give a lovely vista of Arkham\u2019s white Georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow. Here he found a shady road to Arkham, but no trail at all in the seaward direction he wished. Woods and fields crowded up to the high bank of the river\u2019s mouth, and bore not a sign of man\u2019s presence; not even a stone wall or a straying cow, but only the tall grass and giant trees and tangles of briers that the first Indian might have seen. As he climbed slowly east, higher and higher above the estuary on his left and nearer and nearer the sea, he found the way growing in difficulty; till he wondered how ever the dwellers in that disliked place managed to reach the world outside, and whether they came often to market in Arkham. Then the trees thinned, and far below him on his right he saw the hills and antique roofs and spires of Kingsport. Even Central Hill was a dwarf from this height, and he could just make out the ancient graveyard by the Congregational Hospital, beneath which rumour said some terrible caves or burrows lurked. Ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes, and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded grey cottage. Now the ridge narrowed, and Olney grew dizzy at his loneness in the sky. South of him the frightful precipice above Kingsport, north of him the vertical drop of nearly a mile to the river\u2019s mouth. Suddenly a great chasm opened before him, ten feet deep, so that he had to let himself down by his hands and drop to a slanting floor, and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in the opposite wall."}

He showed much lack of care and mockery at the man's complaint. This was despite all the watchfulness taken to follow the rulse. He did not know about Henderson's special complaint. He promised to tell the office when the formal appeal could be made. Saying a short goodbye, he expressed his total powerlessness against the city's orders. He urged the man to accept the unavoidable money demands. Henderson was happy to get away from that curb. Something heavy and one-eyed seemed to hang over it. It was as if the eaten coins had left behind an echo of hopelessness. He had never trusted those devices. Even now, though he was calm, a qualtiy hid in their empty, shiny eyes. It made him feel a strong need to go back into the ungoverned alleys quickly.\n###\nFor almost two hours Mr. Henderson waited vainly by the municipal parking kiosk, watching the metallic faces with their implacable digits where coins had been inserted, and scowling darkly at the printed ordinance upon the rusted panel, whence for decades the arcane statutes of the city council had exerted their baleful influence. After a time the twilight began to gather, and the diurnal bustle gave place to a vague growing dread which crept meter-like before the final expiration. The enforcement officer finally arrived, and shewed much indifference and scorn at the petitioner\u2019s protest after all the vigilance which had been taken to observe the regulations. He had not known of Henderson\u2019s peculiar grievance, and promised to notify the bureau when the appeal might be formally lodged. In bidding the man a curt farewell he expressed his utter futility before the municipality\u2019s decrees, and urged the complainant to resign himself to the inexorable fiscal demands. Henderson was glad to escape from that curbside, for something oppressive and cyclopean seemed to brood over it; as if the devoured coins had left behind a resonance of despair. He had never trusted those mechanisms; and even now, stoic though he was, there lurked a character in their blank, glazed eyes which made him feel an urgent need to retreat into the unregulated alleys as soon as possible."}

Would a human eye see the buildup? Could my human finger learn all the ancient shapes of dirt? Would the layer be smooth and whole? And what would I see?

Before I knew it I was past the edge of the keyboard and leaning close through a veil of utterly undisturbed dust toward a patch which I seemed to know morbidly, horribly well.

And yet, when I flashed my torch upon it in that frightful megalithic abyss, I saw that the queerly pigmented letters on the brittle, aeon-browned cellulose pages were not indeed any nameless hieroglyphs of earth\u2019s youth.

The expression on his face may easily have arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw, while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old matters he had uncovered. As for the anomalous conditions at the deserted church on Federal Hill\u2014the shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to some charlatanry, conscious or unconscious, with at least some of which Blake was secretly connected. For after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the field of myth, dream, terror, and superstition, and avid in his quest for scenes and effects of a bizarre, spectral sort. His earlier stay in the city\u2014a visit to a strange old man as deeply given to occult and forbidden lore as he\u2014had ended amidst death and flame, and it must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his home in Milwaukee. He may have known of the old stories despite his statements to the contrary in the diary, and his death may have nipped in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection. Among those, however, who have examined and correlated all this evidence, there remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories. They are inclined to take much of Blake\u2019s diary at its face value, and point significantly to certain facts such as the undoubted genuineness of the old church record, the verified existence of the disliked and unorthodox Starry Wisdom sect prior to 1877, the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named Edwin M.

As we all took the train for Anchester I felt myself poised on the brink of frightful revelations, a sensation symbolised by the air of mourning among the many Americans at the unexpected death of the President on the other side of the world. On the evening of August 7th we reached Exham Priory, where the servants assured me that nothing unusual had occurred. The cats, even old Nigger-Man, had been perfectly placid; and not a trap in the house had been sprung. We were to begin exploring on the following day, awaiting which I assigned well-appointed rooms to all my guests. I myself retired in my own tower chamber, with Nigger-Man across my feet. Sleep came quickly, but hideous dreams assailed me. There was a vision of a Roman feast like that of Trimalchio, with a horror in a covered platter. Then came that damnable, recurrent thing about the swineherd and his filthy drove in the twilit grotto. Yet when I awoke it was full daylight, with normal sounds in the house below. The rats, living or spectral, had not troubled me; and Nigger-Man was quietly asleep. On going down, I found that the same tranquillity had prevailed elsewhere; a condition which one of the assembled savants\u2014a fellow named Thornton, devoted to the psychic\u2014rather absurdly laid to the fact that I had now been shewn the thing which certain forces had wished to shew me. All was now ready, and at 11 a.m. our entire group of seven men, bearing powerful electric searchlights and implements of excavation, went down to the sub-cellar and bolted the door behind us. Nigger-Man was with us, for the investigators found no occasion to despise his excitability, and were indeed anxious that he be present in case of obscure rodent manifestations. We noted the Roman inscriptions and unknown altar designs only briefly, for three of the savants had already seen them, and all knew their characteristics. Prime attention was paid to the momentous central altar, and within an hour Sir William Brinton had caused it to tilt backward, balanced by some unknown species of counterweight. There now lay revealed such a horror as would have overwhelmed us had we not been prepared. Through a nearly square opening in the tiled floor, sprawling on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that it was little more than an inclined plane at the centre, was a ghastly array of human or semi-human bones."}

The tall - backed bench faced the line of covered windows on the left. Appeared to have someone sitting on it, thouhg I was not certain. I did not like all that I saw. I felt the fear again that I had felt before. This fear became stronger from what had earlier reduced it, because the more I looked at the old [THING] 's calm face the more its very calmness scared me. The eyes did not move, and the skin was too much like wax. Finally I was certain it was not a [THING] at all. A quite clever. The soft hands, oddly covered with gloves, wrote kindly on the writing pad. Told me I must wait some time before I could be taken to the place of celebration. Pointing to a [THING], [THING]. Stack of books, the old [THING] now left the [THING]. When I sat down to read I saw that the books were very old. Covered with mold. That they contained old Morryster 's crazy Marvells of Science, the awful Saducismus Triumphatus of Joseph Glanvill, published in 1681, the disturbing Daemonolatreia of Remigius, printed in 1595 at Lyons. Most terrible of all, the unspeakable Necronomicon of the insane Arab Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius ' banned Latin translation. A [THING] which I had never seen. About which I had heard terrible things said quietly. No one talked to me. I could hear the creaking of signs in the [THING] outside. The whirring sound of the [THING] as the old [THING] with the bonnet kept on with her silent spinning, spinning. I thought the [THNIG]. The [THING] were very gloomy. Because an old family tradition had called me to odd feasts, I decided to expect strange thnigs. I tried to read. Soon became shakingly focused on something I found in that cursed Necronomicon. A thought and a story too horrible for a sane mind or awareness. I did not like it when I imagined I heard the closing of one of the windows that the bench faced, as if it had been quietly opened. It had seemed to come after a whirring sound that was not from the old [THING] 's spinning - [THING]. This was not very important, though, becasue the old [THING] was spinning very hard. The old clock had been striking.\n###\nAn indefinite dampness seemed upon the place, and I marvelled that no fire should be blazing. The high-backed settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left, and seemed to be occupied, though I was not sure. I did not like everything about what I saw, and felt again the fear I had had. This fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it, for the more I looked at the old man\u2019s bland face the more its very blandness terrified me. The eyes never moved, and the skin was too like wax. Finally I was sure it was not a face at all, but a fiendishly cunning mask. But the flabby hands, curiously gloved, wrote genially on the tablet and told me I must wait a while before I could be led to the place of festival. Pointing to a chair, table, and pile of books, the old man now left the room; and when I sat down to read I saw that the books were hoary and mouldy, and that they included old Morryster\u2019s wild Marvells of Science, the terrible Saducismus Triumphatus of Joseph Glanvill, published in 1681, the shocking Daemonolatreia of Remigius, printed in 1595 at Lyons, and worst of all, the unmentionable Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, in Olaus Wormius\u2019 forbidden Latin translation; a book which I had never seen, but of which I had heard monstrous things whispered. No one spoke to me, but I could hear the creaking of signs in the wind outside, and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning, spinning. I thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and disquieting, but because an old tradition of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings, I resolved to expect queer things. So I tried to read, and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something I found in that accursed Necronomicon; a thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or consciousness. But I disliked it when I fancied I heard the closing of one of the windows that the settle faced, as if it had been stealthily opened. It had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old woman\u2019s spinning-wheel. This was not much, though, for the old woman was spinning very hard, and the aged clock had been striking."}

This was more to his credit because he led the group. Must have seen it first. It was a twilight cave of huge height. It stretched farther than any [THING] could see. It was an underground world of endless mystery and horrible suggestion. There were buildings and other old structures. In one terrified look, I saw a strange pattern of mounds. I saw a rough circle of large stones. I saw a low, dome - shaped Roman ruin. I saw a wide - spreading Saxon [THING]. I saw an early English wooden structure. But all these were made small by the ghastly sight on the ground. For yards around the stpes, there was a mad tangle of human bones. Or bones at least as human as thsoe on the steps. Like a foamy [THING] tehy stretched. Some had fallen apart. Others were whole or partly connectde as skeletons. These last ones were always in poses of demonic frenzy. They were either fighting off some threat or grabbing other forms with cannibal purpose. When Dr. Trask, the anthropologist, bent down to sort the skulls. He found a degraded mixture that completely confused him. They were mostly lowre than Piltdown [THING] on the evolutionary scale. But in every case, they were definitely human. Many were of a higher grade. A very few were skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types. All the bones were gnawed. Mostly by rats, but somewhat by others of the half - human herd.

Horror piled horror on horror as we began to understand the old buildings. The four - legged creatureshad been kept in [THING] pens. They must have broken out in their final madness of hunger or fear of rats.\n###\nOf seven cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure; a thing more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight first. It was a twilit grotto of enormous height, stretching away farther than any eye could see; a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and horrible suggestion. There were buildings and other architectural remains\u2014in one terrified glance I saw a weird pattern of tumuli, a savage circle of monoliths, a low-domed Roman ruin, a sprawling Saxon pile, and an early English edifice of wood\u2014but all these were dwarfed by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the ground. For yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human bones, or bones at least as human as those on the steps. Like a foamy sea they stretched, some fallen apart, but others wholly or partly articulated as skeletons; these latter invariably in postures of daemoniac frenzy, either fighting off some menace or clutching other forms with cannibal intent. When Dr. Trask, the anthropologist, stooped to classify the skulls, he found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him. They were mostly lower than the Piltdown man in the scale of evolution, but in every case definitely human. Many were of higher grade, and a very few were the skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types. All the bones were gnawed, mostly by rats, but somewhat by others of the half-human drove.

It was the antechamber of hell, and poor Thornton fainted again when Trask told him that some of the skeleton things must have descended as quadrupeds through the last twenty or more generations.

It had an unknown light spectrum. It decayed in air. It destroyed silicon compounds and was itself destroyed in the process. It showed no clear identifying features. After all tesst, the college scientists had to admit they could nnot classify it. It was not from this earth. It was a piece of the vast outer cosmos. As such, it had properties from outside and followed laws from outside.\n###\nConjecture was vain; so after a futile attempt to find additional globules by drilling, the seekers left again with their new specimen\u2014which proved, however, as baffling in the laboratory as its predecessor had been. Aside from being almost plastic, having heat, magnetism, and slight luminosity, cooling slightly in powerful acids, possessing an unknown spectrum, wasting away in air, and attacking silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result, it presented no identifying features whatsoever; and at the end of the tests the college scientists were forced to own that they could not place it. It was nothing of this earth, but a piece of the great outside; and as such dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws."}

This was after the disappearances of his sailors stopped. He must have started to be and in his graveyard trips. He was caught on wanderings., rumours of sounds and activities at his Pawtuxet farm decreased. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement stayed. But not until times did anyone think to make comparisons. This happened when Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library. The comparison was between the number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766. The number for whom he could produce bills of sale. These sales would be to slave - dealers at the Great Bridge or to planters of the Narragansett Country. one embittered youth had thought of it., the and cleverness of this man were.

A feeling of tension.\n###\nNow, however, he cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked. The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, did it occur to any person\u2014save one embittered youth, perhaps\u2014to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound, once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him. But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight. Curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer. His elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness."}

We started walking as dusk fell. A silver moon hung over the woods to our left. We were that the Sabbath was happening. News of our coming group must have reached the hills. without a decision, the rumor was. the drums beat as. It seemed celebrants did not care if the People forces marched against them. The sound grew as we entered a rising gap in the hills., wooded banks closed in on both sides. Our moving torchse lit up tree trunks. Everyone was on foot except Libo, Balbutius, Asellius, a centurions, and myself. The path became and that those with horses had to leave them. A squad of ten men stayed to guard the hosres. Robber bands were on such a night., we thought we saw a form in the woods. After a - hour climb, the, path made our group 's advance. Our group had over 300 men., with horrifying, we heard a sound from. It came from the horses. They screamed, they did not neigh, they screamed. There was no light. There was no sound of any thing to show why they had done. At the moment, bonfires blazed on all the peaks. Terror seemed to lurk both before and behind us. As for the youth Vercellius, our guide, we found a heap. He lay in a pool of blood. In his hand was a sword taken from the belt of D. Vibulanus, a subcenturion. His face held a look of terror that the veterans turned. He had killed himself when the horses screamed. He had been born and lived all his life in that region. He knew what men whispered about the hills.\n###\nFinally a young man named Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to take us at least past the foothills. We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a young moon trembling over the woods on our left. That which disquieted us most was the fact that the Sabbath was to be held at all. Reports of the coming cohort must have reached the hills, and even the lack of a final decision could not make the rumour less alarming\u2014yet there were the sinister drums as of yore, as if the celebrants had some peculiar reason to be indifferent whether or not the forces of the Roman People marched against them. The sound grew louder as we entered a rising gap in the hills, steep wooded banks enclosing us narrowly on either side, and displaying curiously fantastic tree-trunks in the light of our bobbing torches. All were afoot save Libo, Balbutius, Asellius, two or three of the centuriones, and myself, and at length the way became so steep and narrow that those who had horses were forced to leave them; a squad of ten men being left to guard them, though robber bands were not likely to be abroad on such a night of terror. Once in a while it seemed as though we detected a skulking form in the woods nearby, and after a half-hour's climb the steepness and narrowness of the way made the advance of so great a body of men\u2014over 300, all told\u2014exceedingly cumbrous and difficult. Then with utter and horrifying suddenness we heard a frightful sound from below. It was from the tethered horses\u2014they had screamed, not neighed, but screamed... and there was no light down there, nor the sound of any human thing, to shew why they had done so. At the same moment bonfires blazed out on all the peaks ahead, so that terror seemed to lurk equally well before and behind us. Looking for the youth Vercellius, our guide, we found only a crumpled heap weltering in a pool of blood. In his hand was a short sword snatched from the belt of D. Vibulanus, a subcenturio, and on his face was such a look of terror that the stoutest veterans turned pale at the sight. He had killed himself when the horses screamed... he, who had been born and lived all his life in that region, and knew what men whispered about the hills."}

These false ideas were always about the soft sounds she thought she heard. The sounds came from the attic laboratory and bedroom. They included muffled sighs and sobbings at very strange times. Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to go to Atlantic City for an open - ended rest stay. He warned both Mr. Ward and the tired, hard - to - find Charles to write her only happy letters. She probably owes her life and continued mental health to this forced and unwilling trip. Not long after his mother left, Charles Ward started making deals for the Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a dirty little wooden [THING] with a concrete garage. It sat high on the thinly populated [THING] bank a little above Rhodes. But for some strange reason, the young [THING] wanted nothing else. He gave the real estate agents no rest until one got it for him. They paid a very high price to a somewhat unwilling owner. As soon as it was empty, he moved in secretly at night. He moved everything in a large closed van. This included all things from his attic laboratory. It also included the strange and modern books he had taken from his study. He had this van loaded in the dark early morning. His father remembers only a sleepy awareness of quiet curses. Stomping feet the night the things were taken. After that, Charles moved back to his own old rooms on the third [THING]. He never visited the attic again. To the Pawtuxet bungalow, Charles moved all the secrecy he had around his attic area. Except now he seemed to have two [THING] sharing his secrets. One was a bad - looking Portuguese mixed - race [THING] from the South Main St waterfront. He worked as a servant. The other was a thin, scholarly stranger with dark glasses. He had a short, full beard that looked dyed. His status was clearly that of a coworker. Neighbours tried without success to talk to these strange [THING]. The mixed - race [THING] Gomes spoke very little English. The bearded [THING], who said his name was Dr. Allen, chose to do the same. Ward himself tried to be more friendly. But he only managed to cause curiosity wiht his wandering stories about chemical research. Soon srtange stories began to spread. They were about lights burning all night. A bit later, after this burning suddenly stopped, even stranger stories arose. They were about unusually large [THING] orders from the butcher.\n###\nThese delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom, and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times. Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite recuperative sojourn, and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and elusive Charles to write her only cheering letters. It is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity. Not long after his mother\u2019s departure Charles Ward began negotiating for the Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage, perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else. He gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner, and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness, transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic laboratory, including the books both weird and modern which he had borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in the black small hours, and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away. After that Charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor, and never haunted the attic again. To the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded his attic realm, save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries; a villainous-looking Portuguese half-caste from the South Main St. waterfront who acted as a servant, and a thin, scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague. Neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in conversation. The mulatto Gomes spoke very little English, and the bearded man, who gave his name as Dr. Allen, voluntarily followed his example. Ward himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research. Before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butcher\u2019s"}

Some instinct warned Armitage that the event happening was not for eyes to see. he pushed the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan. He had told some of his guesses and worries to these men. He motioned for these two to go with him. The sounds from had stopped by this time. Except for a, droning whine from the dog. But Armitage noticed with a start. A gruop of whippoorwills in the shrubbery had begun a piping. It was as if in unison with the breaths of a dying man. The building was of a smell. Dr. Armitage knew this smell. The three men rushed across the hall to the reading - room. The whining came from. For a nobody dared to turn on the light. Armitage gathered his courage and snapped the switch. One of the three shrieked. It is not which one. They shrieked at what lay sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice states that he lost consciousness for an instant., he did not stumble or fall. The thing lay - on its side in a pool of - ichor. It was nine feet. The dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It was not. It twitched and. Its chest heaved in unison with the piping of the waiting whippoorwills. Bits of shoe - leather and pieces of clothing were scattered about the room. inside the window an canvas sack lay where it had been thrown. Near the desk a revolver had fallen. A but cartridge explained why it had not been fired., the thing itself pushed out all images at that time. It would be overused. Not to say no pen could describe it. But one may say it could not be pictured by anyone. This is for anyone whose iedas of appearance. Shape are tied to the life - forms of this planet. Of the three known dimensions.\n###\nWhat had come had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a watchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided; but Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping, as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying man. The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr. Armitage knew too well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading-room whence the low whining came. For a second nobody dared to turn on the light, then Armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch. One of the three\u2014it is not certain which\u2014shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall. The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It was not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central desk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions."}

He saw the great central plaza filled with fighting ghouls and night - gaunts. Day, he was sure, must be almost ready to happen. But the army was so strong that surprising the enemy would not be necessary. The greenish glow near the docks still shone faintly. The lack of ghoul sounds showed that the torture of the prisoners had stopped for now. The ghouls gvae chattering directions to their mounts. To the group of riderless night - gaunts aheda. Soon they roes in wide, whirring columns. They swept over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame. Carter was now next to Pickman in the front row of ghouls. As they got closer to the foul camp, he saw the [THING] - beasts were completely unprepared. The there prisoners lay tied up and still beside the [THING]. Their toad - like captors were slumped around drowsily in no clear order. The almost - human slaves were asleep. Even the guards were avoiding a duty that must have seemed pointless to them in this place. The final dive of the night - gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden. Each of the greyish toad - like horrors. Their almost - human slaves was grabbed by a group of night - gaunts before any sound was made. The [THING] - beasts, of course, could not speak. Even slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them silent. There were struggles from those large, jelly - like monsters as the mocking night - gaunts grabbed them. But nothing worked against the strength of those black, gripping claws. When a [THING] - beast struggled too hard, a night - gaunt would grab. Pull its shaking pink tentacles. This seemed to hurt so much that the victim would stop fighting. Carter expected to see a lot of killing. But he found the ghouls had much more clever plans. They chattered certain simple orders to the night - gaunts holding the captives. They trusted the rest to instinct. Soon the unlucky creatures wree carried silently away into the Great Abyss. They would be divided equally among the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dark dwellers. These beings ' ways of feeding are not painless for their chosen victims. Meanwhile, the three tied - up ghouls were freed and comforted by their winning relatives. Various groups searched the area for any possible remaining [THING] - beast.s They also boarded the bad - smelling black ship at the dock. They did this to make sure nothing had escaped the overall dfeeat.\n###\nWhen, after a great interval, Carter saw again the sickly light of Sarkomand\u2019s nocturnal sky, it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and night-gaunts. Day, he felt sure, must be almost due; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed. The greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly, though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce. Softly glibbering directions to their steeds, and to the flock of riderless night-gaunts ahead, the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame. Carter was now beside Pickman in the front rank of ghouls, and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moon-beasts were totally unprepared. The three prisoners lay bound and inert beside the fire, while their toad-like captors slumped drowsily about in no certain order. The almost-human slaves were asleep, even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctory. The final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden, each of the greyish toad-like blasphemies and their almost-human slaves being seized by a group of night-gaunts before a sound was made. The moon-beasts, of course, were voiceless; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence. Horrible were the writhings of those great jellyish abnormalities as the sardonic night-gaunts clutched them, but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons. When a moon-beast writhed too violently, a night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles. Carter expected to see much slaughter, but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans. They glibbered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts which held the captives, trusting the rest to instinct; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the Great Abyss, to be distributed impartially amongst the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims. Meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk, whilst various parties searched the neighbourhood for possible remaining moon-beasts, and boarded the evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat."}

But of course, the effectiveness of all this late organizing was necessarily small. The spice rack continued to be ignored and messy. The single fact of its continued chaos during cooking would have been enough to prove this. One could see that in the end, one's cooking efforts would likely suffer. One's complex recipes. Mixtures, whatever they were, apparently needed ready access to ingredients to make them. Since changing the system would take away the organizational beneifts one had gained, it would not have helped to start over with a different method just then. Prudence demanded that one fix the relationships between the jars on the shelf. Then one's presence before it might no longer be a signal for frantic searching, obvious excuses about wrong labels. A genearl feeling of annoyanec. The containers, now reduced to misshapen. Unlabeled leftovers no sensible person would accept, were causing much distress. One kept any appearance of order only by being diligent in putting some kind of system on them. This was an adhesive tag, a readable note. A bit of knowledge veyr relevant to their contents. In mayn cases, food writers have noted with some awe that a properly arranged rack almost shows the power of an expert. It can reveal forgotten seasonings for inspired use.

We certainly did not mean to face what we feared\u2014yet I will not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden vantage-point. Probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself, though there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great circular place shewn on the crumpled sketches we had found. We had at once recognised it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in the very earliest carvings, but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture from above. Something about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these hasty diagrams, made us think that its sub-glacial levels must still form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures in which it figured\u2014being indeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings, if preserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form a good present link with the upper world\u2014a shorter route than the one we were so carefully blazing, and probably that by which those others had descended. At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches\u2014which quite perfectly confirmed our own\u2014and start back over the indicated course to the circular place; the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed twice before us. The other neighbouring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that.

The year must have been in the late republic, for the province was still ruled by a senatorial proconsul instead of a pr\u00e6torian legate of Augustus, and the day was the first before the Kalends of November. The hills rose scarlet and gold to the north of the little town, and the westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude new stone and plaster buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus some distance to the east. Groups of citizens\u2014broad-browed Roman colonists and coarse-haired Romanised natives, together with obvious hybrids of the two strains, alike clad in cheap woollen togas\u2014and sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and coarse-mantled, black-bearded tribesmen of the circumambient Vascones\u2014all thronged the few paved streets and forum; moved by some vague and ill-defined uneasiness. I myself had just alighted from a litter, which the Illyrian bearers seemed to have brought in some haste from Calagurris, across the Iberus to the southward. It appeared that I was a provincial qu\u00e6stor named L. C\u00e6lius Rufus, and that I had been summoned by the proconsul, P. Scribonius Libo, who had come from Tarraco some days before. The soldiers were the fifth cohort of the XIIth legion, under the military tribune Sex. Asellius; and the legatus of the whole region, Cn. Balbutius, had also come from Calagurris, where the permanent station was. The cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills. All the townsfolk were frightened, and had begged the presence of a cohort from Calagurris. It was the Terrible Season of the autumn, and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns. They were the very old folk who dwelt higher up in the hills and spoke a choppy language which the Vascones could not understand. One seldom saw them; but a few times a year they sent down little yellow, squint-eyed messengers (who looked like Scythians) to trade with the merchants by means of gestures, and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks, their howlings and altar-fires throwing terror into the villages. Always the same\u2014the night before the Kalends of Maius and the night before the Kalends of November. Townsfolk would disappear just before these nights, and would never be heard of again."}

Slowly I began to feel a strong wonder at crazy. shapes of damaged surface. The table itself was very poor in both material and workmanship. Its complex, giant carvings, though done in a rough. Random way, were clearly patterns that only a planned. Even supernatural force could create. I often asked myself, how could the blind rubbing of a common tool create forms whose rather existence suggested a hidden hint of design? How could any household item have made even a hint of those shining networks of geometry. Depth that the wood grain whispered about in its chaotic damage? More I leaned toward the belief that in the pitiful object before me lay the messy center of something beyond my understanding. Something far beyond the understanding of my more practical. Less observant household.\n###\nBy degrees I commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic configurations of the marred surface.

How, I often asked myself, could the blind abrasion of a common utensil conjure up forms whose very existence argued a lurking spark of design? How could any domestic implement have wrought so much as a suggestion of those glittering networks of abyssal geometry and depth about which the grain whispered in its chaotic disfigurement? More and more I inclined to the belief that in the pitiful object which stood before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension; something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more practical but less perceptive domestic and scholarly colleagues."}

Arguments from opponents remained unanswered or put off with promises, and eventually the controversy petered out into oblivion. During late May and June I was in constant correspondence with Akeley; though once in a while a letter would be lost, so that we would have to retrace our ground and perform considerable laborious copying. What we were trying to do, as a whole, was to compare notes in matters of obscure mythological scholarship and arrive at a clearer correlation of the Vermont horrors with the general body of primitive world legend. For one thing, we virtually decided that these morbidities and the hellish Himalayan Mi-Go were one and the same order of incarnated nightmare. There were also absorbing zo\u00f6logical conjectures, which I would have referred to Professor Dexter in my own college but for Akeley\u2019s imperative command to tell no one of the matter before us. If I seem to disobey that command now, it is only because I think that at this stage a warning about those farther Vermont hills\u2014and about those Himalayan peaks which bold explorers are more and more determined to ascend\u2014is more conducive to public safety than silence would be. One specific thing we were leading up to was a deciphering of the hieroglyphics on that infamous black stone\u2014a deciphering which might well place us in possession of secrets deeper and more dizzying than any formerly known to man."}

Perhaps it was natural for him to dream a new name; for he was the last of his household to shop thusly, and alone among the indifferent throngs of the city, so there were not many to speak to him and remind him what he had once selected. His patience and list were gone, and he did not care for the methods of shoppers about him, but preferred to dream and muse of his selections. What he contemplated was mocked by those to whom he described it, so that after a time he kept his musings to himself, and finally ceased to vocalise them. The more he withdrew from the bustle about him, the more wondrous became his inspections; and it would have been quite futile to try to describe their criteria on paper. Percival was not modern, and did not think like others who chose. Whilst they strove to strip from the fruit its embroidered skins of perfection, and to shew in naked ugliness the blemished thing that is sustenance, Percival sought for ripeness alone. When reason and scrutiny failed to reveal it, he sought it in texture and hue, and found it on the very wooden cart, amid the nebulous memories of grandmother\u2019s admonitions and arcane market lore."}

These were fates that should not be present inside the lands of the Roman People. Allowing wild parties of the sort known to happen at Sabbaths would hardly match the traditions of those whose ancestors, when A. Postumius was consul, had put to death so many Roman citizens for practicing the Bacchanalia. This event is always remembered by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, carved on bronze. Displayed for all to see. Checked in time, before the advancement of the rituals might call forth somehting that the iron of a Roman spear might not handle, the Sabbath would not be beyond the abilities of one cohort. Only those taking part needed to be arrested. Sparing many mere onlookers would greatly reduce the anger any supportive local [THING] might feel. In brief, both morality and practical strategy required firm action. I did not doubt that Publius Scribonius, remembering the respect. Duties of the Roman People, would stick to his plan of sending the cohort, with me along, despite any objections that Balbutius. Asellius might choose to raise. They spoke more like provincial [THING] than Romans. The low [THING] was now very near setting. The whole quiet [THING] seemed covered in a strange and evil spell. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul showed he agreed with my words. He placed me with the cohort in the temporary role of leading centurion. Balbutius and Asellius agreed, the former more willingly than the latter. As evening came on the wild autumn hillsides, a regular, awful beating of odd drums came from far away in a frightening rhythm. A few of the soldiers showed fear, but sharp orders got them into formation. Soon the whole cohort was arranged on the open flatland east of the racetrack. Libo himself, and also Balbutius, insisted on going with the cohort. We had much trouble finding a local guide to show paths up the [THING]. Finally a young [THING] named Vercellius, the son of purely Roman parents, agreed to lead us at least past the lower hills. We started to march in the growing dark. The thin silver curve of a new [THING] shook above the woods on our left.\n###\nThere were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia\u2014a matter kept ever in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set open to every eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort. Only participants need be apprehended, and the sparing of a great number of mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment which any of the sympathising country folk might feel. In short, both principle and policy demanded stern action; and I could not doubt but that Publius Scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the Roman People, would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as Balbutius and Asellius\u2014speaking indeed more like provincials than Romans\u2014might see fit to offer and multiply. The slanting sun was now very low, and the whole hushed town seemed draped in an unreal and malign glamour. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul signified his approval of my words, and stationed me with the cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus; Balbutius and Asellius assenting, the former with better grace than the latter. As twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes, a measured, hideous beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible rhythm. Some few of the legionarii shewed timidity, but sharp commands brought them into line, and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open plain east of the circus. Libo himself, as well as Balbutius, insisted on accompanying the cohort; but great difficulty was suffered in getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain. Finally a young man named Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to take us at least past the foothills. We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a young moon trembling over the woods on our left."}

Around them was a scattering of salt \u2014 taken from the damaged supply boxes on planes. This brought up the ideas.

That impression did not concern prints. It was connected with all the talk of fossil prints which Lake had been discussing throughout the weeks. One had to be of one 's imagination near those overshadowing mountains of madness. As I have said, Gedney. One dog turned out to be missing in the end. When we found that shelter we had missed two dogs and two men. The dissecting tent, which we entered after investigating the graves, had something to show. It was not as Lake had left it. The covered parts of the monster had been taken from the makeshift table., we had realized that one of the six damaged. buried things we found must represent the collected sections of the creature which Lake had tried to examine. That one had a trace of a smell. On and around that laboratory table were scattered things. It did not take us to geuss those things were the. dissected parts of one man.

Around it we found a mess of matches. We buried the parts with the ten men. We buried the dog parts with the 35 dogs.\n###\nI have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled. Now I must add that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious, cold-blooded, and inhuman fashion. It was the same with dogs and men. All the healthier, fatter bodies, quadrupedal or bipedal, had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed, as by a careful butcher; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt\u2014taken from the ravaged provision-chests on the planes\u2014which conjured up the most horrible associations. The thing had occurred in one of the crude a\u00ebroplane shelters from which the plane had been dragged out, and subsequent winds had effaced all tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory. Scattered bits of clothing, roughly slashed from the human incision-subjects, hinted no clues. It is useless to bring up the half-impression of certain faint snow-prints in one shielded corner of the ruined enclosure\u2014because that impression did not concern human prints at all, but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor Lake had been giving throughout the preceding weeks. One had to be careful of one\u2019s imagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness. As I have indicated, Gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end. When we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs and two men; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent, which we entered after investigating the monstrous graves, had something to reveal. It was not as Lake had left it, for the covered parts of the primal monstrosity had been removed from the improvised table. Indeed, we had already realised that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried things we had found\u2014the one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful odour\u2014must represent the collected sections of the entity which Lake had tried to analyse. On and around that laboratory table were strown other things, and it did not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully though oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog. I shall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man\u2019s identity. Lake\u2019s anatomical instruments were missing, but there were evidences of their careful cleansing. The gasoline stove was also gone, though around it we found a curious litter of matches. We buried the human parts beside the other ten men, and the canine parts with the other 35 dogs."}

The ways to the stone palace are and. The exception is the, curving one where the king. His companions ride on yaks. In yak - drawn chariots. Carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps. It went between walls with inlaid gold sings. It went under balconies. Windows from which floated music. Breaths of smell., those walls, supports, and groups of domes appeared. The Veiled King 's palace is for these., they passed under a arch. Came out in the gardens of the monarch 's pleasure. Carter paused, feeling from beauty. The stone terraces. Walks with columns, the flower beds. flowering trees tied to lattices, the bronze urns. Three - stands with carvings in relief, the statues of marble on stands that looked, the lagoons with stone bottoms. Tiled fountains with glowing fish, the temples of singing birds on top of carved columns, the patterns on the bronze gates. The flowering vines trained along every inch of the walls all joined to form a sight. Its loveliness was beyond reality and - in the land of dream. It shimmered like vision under that twilight sk.y The and decorated magnificence of the palace was. The shape of the peaks was on the right. And the birds and the fountains sang. The smell of blossoms spread like a veil over that garden. No human was, and Carter was it was. they turned and went down the stone alley of steps. No visitor may enter the palace itself. It is not to look and at the dome. It is said to house the father of all the rumored shantak - birds. It sends out dreams to the. After that, the captain took Carter to the part of the town, naer the Gate of the Caravans. There are the taverns of the yak - merchants and the stone miners. And, in a - ceilinged inn of stone workers, they said goodbye. Business called the captain while Carter was to talk with miners about the north. Tehre were men in that inn. The traveler spoke to some of them. He said he was an miner of stone. Was to know something about Inganok 's quarries.\n###\nThe ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow, all but that broad curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yak-drawn chariots. Carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps, between inlaid walls bearing strange signs in gold, and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance. Always ahead loomed those titan walls, mighty buttresses, and clustered and bulbous domes for which the Veiled King\u2019s palace is famous; and at length they passed under a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarch\u2019s pleasure. There Carter paused in faintness at so much of beauty; for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks, the gay parterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices, the brazen urns and tripods with cunning bas-reliefs, the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble, the basalt-bottomed lagoons and tiled fountains with luminous fish, the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns, the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates, and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality, and half-fabulous even in the land of dream. There it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky, with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead, and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right. And ever the small birds and the fountains sang, while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden. No other human presence was there, and Carter was glad it was so. Then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps, for the palace itself no visitor may enter; and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome, since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured shantak-birds, and to send out queer dreams to the curious. After that the captain took Carter to the north quarter of the town, near the Gate of the Caravans, where are the taverns of the yak-merchants and the onyx-miners. And there, in a low-ceiled inn of quarrymen, they said farewell; for business called the captain whilst Carter was eager to talk with miners about the north. There were many men in that inn, and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of them; saying that he was an old miner of onyx, and anxious to know somewhat of Inganok\u2019s quarries."}

You know more than I do about who or what wrote that small message. But I must warn you it was not written for no reason. There are terrible and offensive things that must be destroyed. I believe the person who wrote those words will deal with Orne and Hutchinson. One of those beings once wrote to you, 'do not summon anything you cannot control'. You were destroyed once before, maybe in exactly that way. It could be that your own dakr magic will destroy you all again. Curwen, a person cannot interfere with Nature beyond certain points. Every horror you have created will rise up to erase you.\". Here the doctor was interrupted by a sudden, violent cry from the being in front of him. Hopelessly was trapped, without a weapon. He knew any physical attack would bring mnay helpers to save the doctor. So Joseph Curwen turned to his one old ally. He started a serise of mystical hand movements with his index fingers. His deep, hollow voice, no longer pretending to be rough, shouted out the first words of a dreadful spell. But Willett was faster than him. Just as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl. Just as a cold wind suddenly blew from the bay, the doctor started the serious. Steady speaking of what he had planned to say all along. An eye for an eyelet the result show how well the lesson of the deep void had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of those two spells. The first one had summoned the writer of that small writing. This was the mysterious call whose title was the Dragon's Tail, the sign of the descending node. At the very first word from Willett's mouth, the spell the patient had started stopped completely. Unable to speak, the monster made frantic motions with his arms until they also stopped. Wehn the terrible name Yog-Sothoth was spoken, the horrible change began. It was not just a dissolving, but more a changing or a repeating of form. Willett closed his eyes. He would not faint bfeore the rest of the chant could be said. But he did not faint. That man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never bothered the world again. The madness from beyond time had calmed down. The case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed.\n###\nYou know better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, \u2018do not call up any that you can not put down\u2019. You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man can\u2019t tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out.\u201d But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctor\u2019s rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula. But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye\u2014magic for magic\u2014let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules\u2014the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragon\u2019s Tail, sign of the descending node\u2014 At the very first word from Willett\u2019s mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced. But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed."}

They did not know what the law would demand from them if the matter was not kept quiet. They were thanfkul when West, even though I shook without wanting to, offered to remove the thing quietly. He had a purpose I knwe very well. Bright moonlight shone on the land without snow. We covered the thing. Carried it home together through the empty streets. We had carried a similar thing one terrible night in Arkham. We neared the house from the field behind it. We took body in the back door and down the cellar stairs. We got it ready for the normal test. Our fear of the police was very great, even though we had planned our trip to miss the single policeman of that area. The result was a tired letdown. Ghastly as our prize looked, it did not react at all to any liquid we put into its black arm. These liquids were made from tests on white bodies only. As the time got dangerously close to sunrise, we did what we had done with the others. We pulled the thing across the fields to the edge of the woods near the public burial ground. We buried it there in the best grave the frozen ground would allow. The grave was not very deep. Fully as good as that of the earlier body, the thnig that had risen by itself. Made a sound. In the light of our dark lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves. We were fairly sure the police would never find it in a forest. The next day I was more and more worried about the police. A patient brought stories of a suspected fight and death. West had yet another reason to worry. He had been called in the afternoon to a case that ended in a very threatening way. An Italian woman had become hysterical over her lost child. He was a boy of five who had wandered off early in the morning. Did not come back for dinner. She had developed signs that were very alarming because her heart was always weak. It was a very foolish hysteria, because the boy had often run away before. But Italian country people are very superstitious. This woman seemed as troubled by bad signs as by facts. About seven o\u2019clock in the evening she had died. Her frantic husband had made a terrible scene trying to kill West. He wildly blamed him for not saving her life.\n###\nFear was upon the whole pitiful crowd, for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up; and they were grateful when West, in spite of my involuntary shudders, offered to get rid of the thing quietly\u2014for a purpose I knew too well. There was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape, but we dressed the thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows, as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in Arkham. We approached the house from the field in the rear, took the specimen in the back door and down the cellar stairs, and prepared it for the usual experiment. Our fear of the police was absurdly great, though we had timed our trip to avoid the solitary patrolman of that section. The result was wearily anticlimactic. Ghastly as our prize appeared, it was wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm; solutions prepared from experience with white specimens only. So as the hour grew dangerously near to dawn, we did as we had done with the others\u2014dragged the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potter\u2019s field, and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish. The grave was not very deep, but fully as good as that of the previous specimen\u2014the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound. In the light of our dark lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines, fairly certain that the police would never find it in a forest so dim and dense. The next day I was increasingly apprehensive about the police, for a patient brought rumours of a suspected fight and death. West had still another source of worry, for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very threateningly. An Italian woman had become hysterical over her missing child\u2014a lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and failed to appear for dinner\u2014and had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an always weak heart. It was a very foolish hysteria, for the boy had often run away before; but Italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious, and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts. About seven o\u2019clock in the evening she had died, and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill West, whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life."}

Spoke with me, mind to mind, with a silent. Perfect exchange of thoughts. The time was one of coming victory, for was not my fellow being finally escaping from a low. Getting ready to follow the hated enemy even to the farthest fields of space. That a burning cosmic revenge could be worked upon it which would shake the univers?e We floated like this for a short time, when I noticed a slight blurring. Fading of the things around us, as if some force was calling me back to [THING] \u2014 where I least wanted to go. The shape near me seemed to feel a change too, for it slowly brought its speech to an end. Itself got ready to leave the scene. Fading from my sight at a speed somewhat slower than that of the other things. A few more thoughts were shared. I knew that the bright one. I were being called back to slavery, though for my brother of light it would be the final time. The sad planet shell being almost used up, in less than an hour my fellow would be free to chase the enemy along the Milky Way. Past the nearer stars to the very edges of forever. A clear shock separates my last memory of the fading scene of light from my sudden. Somewhat embarrassed waking. Stiting up straight in my [THING] as I saw the dying figure on the bed move uncertainly. Joe Slater was indeed waking, though likely for the last time. As I looked more closely, I saw that in the pale cheeks shone spots of color which had never been there before. The lips, too, seemed different. Being pressed tightly together, as if by the force of a stronger personality than Slater \u2019s had been. The whole [THING] finally began to grow tense. The [THING] turned restlessly with closed eyes. I did not wake the sleeping nurse. Fixed the slightly moved [THING] - bands of my mind - reading \u201c radio \u201d, determined to catch any final message the dreamer might have to give. Suddenly the [THING] turned sharply toward me. The eyes opened, making me stare in complete surprise at what I saw. The [THING] who had been Joe Slater, the Catskill weak. Fallen [THING], was now looking at me with a pair of bright, wide - open eyes whose blue color seemed to have strangely become deeper.\n###\nThen the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held colloquy with me, soul to soul, with silent and perfect interchange of thought. The hour was one of approaching triumph, for was not my fellow-being escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage; escaping forever, and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether, that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres? We floated thus for a little time, when I perceived a slight blurring and fading of the objects around us, as though some force were recalling me to earth\u2014where I least wished to go. The form near me seemed to feel a change also, for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclusion, and itself prepared to quit the scene; fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects. A few more thoughts were exchanged, and I knew that the luminous one and I were being recalled to bondage, though for my brother of light it would be the last time. The sorry planet-shell being well-nigh spent, in less than an hour my fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the Milky Way and past the hither stars to the very confines of infinity. A well-defined shock separates my final impression of the fading scene of light from my sudden and somewhat shamefaced awakening and straightening up in my chair as I saw the dying figure on the couch move hesitantly. Joe Slater was indeed awaking, though probably for the last time. As I looked more closely, I saw that in the sallow cheeks shone spots of colour which had never before been present. The lips, too, seemed unusual; being tightly compressed, as if by the force of a stronger character than had been Slater\u2019s. The whole face finally began to grow tense, and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes. I did not arouse the sleeping nurse, but readjusted the slightly disarranged head-bands of my telepathic \u201cradio\u201d, intent to catch any parting message the dreamer might have to deliver. All at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open, causing me to stare in blank amazement at what I beheld. The man who had been Joe Slater, the Catskill decadent, was now gazing at me with a pair of luminous, expanded eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have deepened."}

I was rushing toward the Square area to try to get transport out of this rotting city of death. The sight of Zadok Allen created thoughts in my mind. Made me slow my steps. I had been told the man could suggest,, and stories. I had been warned that the people made it to be seen talkign to him. The idea of this witness to the town 's decay, with memories going to the days of ships. Factories, was a temptation that no amount of logic could make me refuse., the. myths are symbols. Stories based on truth. Old Zadok must have seen everything that happened around Innsmouth for the ninety years. Curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution. In my pride, I imagined I might be to find a core of history from the confused, talk I would get with the help of whiskey. I knew I could not approach him, because the firemen would notice., I thought, I would prepare by getting some liquor at a place where the grocery boy told me it was to find. I would hang near the fire station seeming casual. I would meet up with Zadok after he had started on one of his walks. The man said he was, sitting around the station for than an hour. Two at a time. A bottle of whiskey was, though not, obtained behind a variety - store off Square Street in Eilot Street. The - looking man who served me had a hint of the staring \" Innsmouth look \". Was in his way. He was used to the habits of strangerswho were in twon. Going into Square Street, I saw that luck was with me. Shuffling out of Paine Street Street around the corner of the Gilman House, I caught sight of nothing than the,, form of Zadok Allen himself.\n###\nI had long before resolved to limit my observations to architecture alone, and I was even then hurrying toward the Square in an effort to get quick transportation out of this festering city of death and decay; but the sight of old Zadok Allen set up new currents in my mind and made me slacken my pace uncertainly. I had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild, disjointed, and incredible legends, and I had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking to him; yet the thought of this aged witness to the town\u2019s decay, with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories, was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist. After all, the strangest and maddest of myths are often merely symbols or allegories based upon truth\u2014and old Zadok must have seen everything which went on around Innsmouth for the last ninety years. Curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution, and in my youthful egotism I fancied I might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused, extravagant outpouring I would probably extract with the aid of raw whiskey. I knew that I could not accost him then and there, for the firemen would surely notice and object. Instead, I reflected, I would prepare by getting some bootleg liquor at a place where the grocery boy had told me it was plentiful. Then I would loaf near the fire station in apparent casualness, and fall in with old Zadok after he had started on one of his frequent rambles. The youth said that he was very restless, seldom sitting around the station for more than an hour or two at a time. A quart bottle of whiskey was easily, though not cheaply, obtained in the rear of a dingy variety-store just off the Square in Eliot Street. The dirty-looking fellow who waited on me had a touch of the staring \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d, but was quite civil in his way; being perhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangers\u2014truckmen, gold-buyers, and the like\u2014as were occasionally in town. Re\u00ebntering the Square I saw that luck was with me; for\u2014shuffling out of Paine Street around the corner of the Gilman House\u2014I glimpsed nothing less than the tall, lean, tattered form of old Zadok Allen himself."}

I shouted the name Shub-Niggurath. A shape came up from the altar. Five hundred creatures howled. The Hooded Thing said the word 'Kamog' and the name Kamog. That was old Ephraim's secret name in the group. I was in the place where she promised I would not go. One minute I was locked in the library. next minute I was there. She had taken my body there. It was a place of complete evil. It was an unholy pit. The black realm satrts there. A watcher guards the gate. I saw a shoggoth. It changed its shape. I cannot bear it. I will not bear it. I will kill her if she sends me there again. I will kill that being. I will kill her, him, it. I will kill it. I will kill it with my own hands. I spent one hour calming him down. He finally became quiet. The next day I bought him proper clothes in the village. I left wiht him for Arkham. His extreme hysterical anger was gone. He tended to be quiet. But he started to mutter darkly to himself. This happened when the car went through Augusta. The sight of a city seemed to bring back bad memories. He clearly did not want to go home. He had very strange false beliefs about his wife. These false beliefs came from some real hypnotic torture he experienced. I thought it was better if he did not go home. I decided I would let him stay with me for a while. I did not care about the problems it would cause with Asenath. Later I would help him get divorce. There were definitely mental reasons. This marriage was like suicide for him. When we were in open country again, Derby's muttering stopped. I let him nod and sleep in the seat next to me as I drove. During our fast evening drive through Portland, the muttering started again. It was clearer than before. As I listened, I heard a flow of completely crazy talk about Asenath. It was obvious how much she had damgaed Edward's nerves. He had created a whole set of false visions around her.\n###\nDown the six thousand steps . . . the abomination of abominations . . . I never would let her take me, and then I found myself there. . . . I\u00e4! Shub-Niggurath! . . . The shape rose up from the altar, and there were 500 that howled. . . . The Hooded Thing bleated \u2018Kamog! Kamog!\u2019\u2014that was old Ephraim\u2019s secret name in the coven. . . . I was there, where she promised she wouldn\u2019t take me. . . . A minute before I was locked in the library, and then I was there where she had gone with my body\u2014in the place of utter blasphemy, the unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the gate. . . . I saw a shoggoth\u2014it changed shape. . . . I can\u2019t stand it. . . . I won\u2019t stand it. . . . I\u2019ll kill her if she ever sends me there again. . . . I\u2019ll kill that entity . . . her, him, it . . . I\u2019ll kill it! I\u2019ll kill it with my own hands!\u201d It took me an hour to quiet him, but he subsided at last. The next day I got him decent clothes in the village, and set out with him for Arkham. His fury of hysteria was spent, and he was inclined to be silent; though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car passed through Augusta\u2014as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant memories. It was clear that he did not wish to go home; and considering the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wife\u2014delusions undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had been subjected\u2014I thought it would be better if he did not. I would, I resolved, put him up myself for a time; no matter what unpleasantness it would make with Asenath. Later I would help him get a divorce, for most assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage suicidal for him. When we struck open country again Derby\u2019s muttering faded away, and I let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as I drove. During our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again, more distinctly than before, and as I listened I caught a stream of utterly insane drivel about Asenath. The extent to which she had preyed on Edward\u2019s nerves was plain, for he had woven a whole set of hallucinations around her."}

The cereal from the box was eaten very quickly. Surrounded by his friends, Wilkins did not notice the bright, sweet shapes that hide. Spread out on the colorful shelves this time. Before he fully understood what had happened, he was back at his usual table in the kitchen of his home. The plain, cheap boxes were lined up on the counter in rows.

No, he had not seen that thing before and did not know anything about it. His wife had said she found a funny tin thing in one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon. Maybe that was it.

Entering his room, he placed the spiky thing on the table, and lay down in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing to undress. From the closed loft above the slanting ceiling he thought he heard a faint scratching and padding, but he was too disorganised even to mind it. That cryptical pull from the north was getting very strong again, though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the sky. In the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged, furry thing came again and with a greater distinctness than on any former occasion."}

In it, all that wonder sparkles, crystallized to light your evening path. Behold! Your search must not go over seas. It must go - known years. It must go to the things of babyhood. It must go to the, sun - filled glimpses of magic that scenes brought to eyes. Know this: your gold. city of wonder is the total of what you saw. Loved when. It is the glory of Boston 's hillside roofs and windows burning with sunset. It is the flower - Common. It is the dome on the hill. It is the mix of gables and chimneys in the violet valley., the - bridged Charles flows. You saw these things, Randolph Carter, when your nurse wheeled you out in the spring.

It is not over unknown seas but back over well-known years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes. \u201cFor know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth. It is the glory of Boston\u2019s hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset; of the flower-fragrant Common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the many-bridged Charles flows drowsily. These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love.

The camp itself was on foothills that rose from a high flat land. It was about 12,000 feet high. Therefore, the actual height increase needed was not as large as it might appear. Still, we were very aawre of the thin air and extreme cold as we climbed. This was because we had to leave the cabin windows open for visibility. We wore our heaviest furs, of course. As we got closer to the threatening peaks, dark. Evil abvoe the line of cracked snow. Glaciesr, we noticed more. More the strangely regular shapes on the slopes. We thought again of the odd Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich. old and wind-worn rock layers fully confirmed all of Lake's reports. They proved that these ancient peaks had been standing in exactly the same way since a very early time in Earth's history. This was perhaps over fifty million years ago. It was useless to guess how much higher they once were. But everything about this strange area suggested hidden atmospheric effects that slowed change. These effects worked against the usual climate processes that break down rock. It was the mountainside mess of regular cubes, walls. Cave openings that fascinated. Troubled us most. I studied them with field glasses and took aerial photos while Danforth flew the plane. At times, I took ovre the controls so he could use the binoculars. My flying knowledge was only that of an amateur. We could esaily see that much of the material was a light-colored Archaean quartzite. This was different from any rock visible over large areas of the general surface. Their regularity was extreme and unnatural to a degree that poor Lake had barely suggested. As he had said, their edges were broken. Rounded from countless ages of harsh weather. But their unnatural solidity and tough material had saved them from being destroyed. Many parts, especially those nearest the slopes, seemed made of the same substance as the surrounding rock. The whole setup looked like the ruins of Machu Picchu in the Andes. The original foundation walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford\u2013Field Museum Expedition in 1929. Both Danforth and I sometimes got the impression of separate Cyclopean blocks. Lake had credited this impression to his flight companion Carroll. How to explain such things here was honestly beyond me. I felt strangely embarrassed as a geologist.\n###\nThe camp itself, on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau, was some 12,000 feet in altitude; hence the actual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem. Nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense cold as we rose; for on account of visibility conditions we had to leave the cabin windows open. We were dressed, of course, in our heaviest furs. As we drew near the forbidding peaks, dark and sinister above the line of crevasse-riven snow and interstitial glaciers, we noticed more and more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes; and thought again of the strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich. The ancient and wind-weathered rock strata fully verified all of Lake\u2019s bulletins, and proved that these hoary pinnacles had been towering up in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earth\u2019s history\u2014perhaps over fifty million years. How much higher they had once been, it was futile to guess; but everything about this strange region pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavourable to change, and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock disintegration. But it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes, ramparts, and cave-mouths which fascinated and disturbed us most. I studied them with a field-glass and took a\u00ebrial photographs whilst Danforth drove; and at times relieved him at the controls\u2014though my aviation knowledge was purely an amateur\u2019s\u2014in order to let him use the binoculars. We could easily see that much of the material of the things was a lightish Archaean quartzite, unlike any formation visible over broad areas of the general surface; and that their regularity was extreme and uncanny to an extent which poor Lake had scarcely hinted. As he had said, their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold aeons of savage weathering; but their preternatural solidity and tough material had saved them from obliteration. Many parts, especially those closest to the slopes, seemed identical in substance with the surrounding rock surface. The whole arrangement looked like the ruins of Machu Picchu in the Andes, or the primal foundation-walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford\u2013Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I obtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which Lake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll. How to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and I felt queerly humbled as a geologist."}

He is blinking rgiht now over the roofs of Tremont Street. You could see him from your window on Beacon Hill. Out beyond those stars open the great voids from where my mindless masters have sent me. One day you too may cross them. But if you are wise you will avoid such foolishness. Of those humans who have gone. Returned, only one keeps a mind unbroken by the beating, clawing horrors of the void. Terrors and blasphemies fight each other for room. There is more evil in the smaller ones than in the greater ones. You know this from the actions of those who tried to give you to me. I myslef had no wish to break you. I would have helped you come here long ago if I had not been busy elsewhere. I was sure you would find the way yourself. So avoid the outer hells. Stay with the calm, lovely things of your youth. Build your wonderful city. Drive away the disloyal Great Ones. Send them back gently to the scenes from their own youth. Those scenes wait uneasily for their return.

Get on and be ready. There! Yogash the balck one will help you onto the scaly horror. Aim for that brightest star just south of the highest point. It is Vgea. In two hours it will be right abvoe the terrace of your sunset city. Wait for it only until you hear a far-off singing in the high upper air. Beyond that lies madness. So control your shantak when the first note tempts you. Look then back to earth. You will see shining the undying altar flame of Ired-Naa from the sacred roof of a temple. That temple is in your desired sunset city. So steer for it before you listen to the singing and are lost. When you get near the city, steer for the same high wall from where you once saw the spread-out glory. Poke the sahntak until he cries out loud. The Great Ones will hear that cry. Recognize it as they sit on their perfumed terraces. They will feel such a longing for home that all your city's wonders will not comfort them for the absence of Kadath's grim castle. The crown of eternal stars upon it.\n###\nThere is Antares\u2014he is winking at this moment over the roofs of Tremont Street, and you could see him from your window on Beacon Hill. Out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my mindless masters have sent me.

Terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one another for space, and there is more evil in the lesser ones than in the greater; even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to deliver you into my hands, whilst I myself harboured no wish to shatter you, and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had I not been elsewhere busy, and certain that you would yourself find the way. Shun, then, the outer hells, and stick to the calm, lovely things of your youth. Seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant Great Ones, sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their own youth, and which wait uneasy for their return. \u201cEasier even than the way of dim memory is the way I will prepare for you.

Steer for that brightest star just south of the zenith\u2014it is Vega, and in two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city.

He had not known until our hallway conversation that I could overhear his playing in my room, and now asked me if I would arrange with Blandot to take a lower room where I could not hear him in the night. He would, he wrote, defray the difference in rent. As I sat deciphering the execrable French I felt more lenient toward the old man. He was a victim of physical and nervous suffering, as was I; and my metaphysical studies had taught me kindness. In the silence there came a slight sound from the window\u2014the shutter must have rattled in the night-wind\u2014and for some reason I started almost as violently as did Erich Zann. So when I had finished reading I shook my host by the hand, and departed as a friend. The next day Blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor, between the apartments of an aged money-lender and the room of a respectable upholsterer. There was no one on the fourth floor. It was not long before I found that Zann\u2019s eagerness for my company was not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth story. He did not ask me to call on him, and when I did call he appeared uneasy and played listlessly. This was always at night\u2014in the day he slept and would admit no one. My liking for him did not grow, though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me. I had a curious desire to look out of that window, over the wall and down the unseen slope at the glittering roofs and spires which must lie outspread there. Once I went up to the garret during theatre hours, when Zann was away, but the door was locked. What I did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man. At first I would tiptoe up to my old fifth floor, then I grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the peaked garret."}

Upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes brooded. And as I saw therein the lotos-faces vanish, I longed for nets that I might capture them and learn from them the secrets which the moon had brought upon the night. But when the moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore, I saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed. And knowing that to this sunken place all the dead had come, I trembled and did not wish again to speak with the lotos-faces. Yet when I saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky to seek rest on a vast reef, I would fain have questioned him, and asked him of those whom I had known when they were alive. This I would have asked him had he not been so far away, but he was very far, and could not be seen at all when he drew nigh that gigantic reef. So I watched the tide go out under that sinking moon, and saw gleaming the spires, the towers, and the roofs of that dead, dripping city. And as I watched, my nostrils tried to close against the perfume-conquering stench of the world\u2019s dead; for truly, in this unplaced and forgotten spot had all the flesh of the churchyards gathered for puffy sea-worms to gnaw and glut upon. Over those horrors the evil moon now hung very low, but the puffy worms of the sea need no moon to feed by. And as I watched the ripples that told of the writhing of worms beneath, I felt a new chill from afar out whither the condor had flown, as if my flesh had caught a horror before my eyes had seen it. Nor had my flesh trembled without cause, for when I raised my eyes I saw that the waters had ebbed very low, shewing much of the vast reef whose rim I had seen before."}

Disease and the approach of death were, in the absence of a sense of touch or of physical pain, recognised by purely visual symptoms. The dead were incinerated with dignified ceremonies. Once in a while, as before mentioned, a keen mind would escape death by forward projection in time; but such cases were not numerous. When one did occur, the exiled mind from the future was treated with the utmost kindness till the dissolution of its unfamiliar tenement. The Great Race seemed to form a single loosely knit nation or league, with major institutions in common, though there were four definite divisions. The political and economic system of each unit was a sort of fascistic socialism, with major resources rationally distributed, and power delegated to a small governing board elected by the votes of all able to pass certain educational and psychological tests. Family organisation was not overstressed, though ties among persons of common descent were recognised, and the young were generally reared by their parents. Resemblances to human attitudes and institutions were, of course, most marked in those fields where on the one hand highly abstract elements were concerned, or where on the other hand there was a dominance of the basic, unspecialised urges common to all organic life. A few added likenesses came through conscious adoption as the Great Race probed the future and copied what it liked. Industry, highly mechanised, demanded but little time from each citizen; and the abundant leisure was filled with intellectual and aesthetic activities of various sorts. The sciences were carried to an unbelievable height of development, and art was a vital part of life, though at the period of my dreams it had passed its crest and meridian. Technology was enormously stimulated through the constant struggle to survive, and to keep in existence the physical fabric of great cities, imposed by the prodigious geologic upheavals of those primal days. Crime was surprisingly scanty, and was dealt with through highly efficient policing. Punishments ranged from privilege-deprivation and imprisonment to death or major emotion-wrenching, and were never administered without a careful study of the criminal\u2019s motivations. Warfare, largely civil for the last few millennia though sometimes waged against reptilian and octopodic invaders, or against the winged, star-headed Old Ones who centred in the Antarctic, was infrequent though infinitely devastating."}

I think I went. I remember of my climb up the slope. My journey to the stranded boat. I believe I sang a lot and laughed when I could not sing. I have memories of a storm after I reached the boat. At any rate, I know I heard thunder. sounds that Nature makes in her states. When I came out of the darkness I was in a San Francisco hospital. I was brought by the captain of the ship that had picked up my boat in the middle of the ocean. In my madness I had said. But I found my words had received attention. My rescuers knew nothing of any land rising in the Pacific. Nor did I think it to insist on something I knew they could not believe. Once I found a expert on peoples. I amused him with questions about the legend of Dagon, the Fish - God. But seeing he was, I did not push my questions. It is at night, when the moon is bulging. Shrinking, that I see the thing. I tried morphine. But the drug has given relief. It has drawn me into its grip as a slave. I will end it all. I have written a account for the information. amusement of my men. I ask myself if it could have been a fantasy. A result of fever as I lay sun - struck. Raving in the boat after my escape from the warship. This I ask myself. But there comes before me a vision in reply. I can not think of the sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this moment be crawling. Struggling on its bottom. They may be worshipping their stone idols. They may be carvign their images on stone pillars of water - soaked granite. I dream of a day when they may rise above the waves. They may drag down in their stinking claws the remains of, war - mankind. I dream of a day when the land shall sink. The ocean floor shall rise amid chaos. Into the window of my room glows the Pole Star with an light.\n###\nI think I went mad then. Of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff, and of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat, I remember little. I believe I sang a great deal, and laughed oddly when I was unable to sing. I have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after I reached the boat; at any rate, I know that I heard peals of thunder and other tones which Nature utters only in her wildest moods. When I came out of the shadows I was in a San Francisco hospital; brought thither by the captain of the American ship which had picked up my boat in mid-ocean. In my delirium I had said much, but found that my words had been given scant attention. Of any land upheaval in the Pacific, my rescuers knew nothing; nor did I deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which I knew they could not believe. Once I sought out a celebrated ethnologist, and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient Philistine legend of Dagon, the Fish-God; but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional, I did not press my inquiries. It is at night, especially when the moon is gibbous and waning, that I see the thing. I tried morphine; but the drug has given only transient surcease, and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave. So now I am to end it all, having written a full account for the information or the contemptuous amusement of my fellow-men. Often I ask myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasm\u2014a mere freak of fever as I lay sun-stricken and raving in the open boat after my escape from the German man-of-war. This I ask myself, but ever does there come before me a hideously vivid vision in reply. I cannot think of the deep sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be crawling and floundering on its slimy bed, worshipping their ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on submarine obelisks of water-soaked granite. I dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny, war-exhausted mankind\u2014of a day when the land shall sink, and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal pandemonium. Into the north window of my chamber glows the Pole Star with uncanny light."}

They went to see Charles at the hospital. They asked him as carefully as they could about Dr. Allen. They asked about the Prague visit. They asked what he had learned about Simon or Jedediah Oren of Salem. The young [THING] gave polite answers that did not commit to anything for all these questions. He only spoke in his rough whisper. He said he had found Dr. Allen had an amazing spiritual connection with some souls from the past. He said any contact the bearded [THING] migth have in Prague would likely have the same special ability. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realized to their annoyance that they had actually been the ones being questioned. The confined young [THING] had skillfully gotten all the information from them. He did this without giving any important information himself. He learned everything the Prague letter had contained. Drs. Lyman did not think the strange letters of young Ward 's friend were very important. They knew that similar odd and osbessed [THING] often group together. They believed that Charles or Allen had only found a similar [THING] living abroad. Maybe this [THING] had seen Orne 's handwriting and copied it. He might be trying to act like he was the old [THING] reborn. Allen himself might be a similar case. He may have convinced the young [THING] to accept him as a living form of the long - dead Curwe.n Such things had happened before. Using this practical thinking, the sensible doctors dismissed Willett 's increasing worry about Charles Ward 's current handwriting. Willett had studied it frmo unplanned samples gotten by various tricks. Willett thought he had finally identified its strange familiarity. He thought it vaguely looked like the old handwriting of Joseph Curwen himself. But the other doctors saw this as just a copying phase. They expected this in a madness of this type. They refused to see it as important either good or bad. Because of this ordinary attitude in his coworkers, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep a certain letter private. This letter arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April. It was from Rakus, Transylvania. Its handwriting was. Basically lkie the Hutchinson code that both the father. The doctor stopped in fear before opening it. It read as follows: Dear C.:\u2014I had a Squad of 20 Militia come to talk about what the Cuontry Folk say. Muts dig deeper and have less Hearde.\n###\nThe father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think, went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about Dr. Allen, about the Prague visit, and about what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in Prague would probably be similarly gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism; and that without imparting anything vital himself, the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the Prague letter had contained. Drs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young Ward\u2019s companion; for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart\u2014perhaps one who had seen Orne\u2019s handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone character\u2019s reincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead Curwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the hard-headed doctors disposed of Willett\u2019s growing disquiet about Charles Ward\u2019s present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus, Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal. This read as follows: Dear C.:\u2014Hadd a Squad of 20 Militia up to talk about what the Country Folk say. Must digg deeper and have less Hearde."}

Machines must have guided my passage, yet I cannot recall any driver except myself; or anything moving but the silent, creeping cars and the dim, hovering lights. I think that whoever designed this structure must have been shockingly utilitarian, since my first conception of a built space was that of something mockingly like a cavern, yet angular, oppressive, and cyclopean like the foundations. To me there was nothing unnatural in the concrete pillars and the stark, repeating beams that strowed the endless, shadowed tiers deep down among the sub-levels. I fantastically associated these things with every-day journeys, and thought them more real than the garish advertisements of open skies and verdant landscapes which I found in many of the abandoned brochures. From such signs I learned all that I know.

Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Orne\u2019s and Hutchinson\u2019s; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise. At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Ward\u2019s immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charles\u2019s normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard\u2019s writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection."}

To Mr. Ward he said, \" I can not asnwer any questions. However, I will say there are different types of magic. I have performed a great cleansing. The [THING] in this [THING] will sleep better because of it. \" That Dr. Willett 's \" cleansing \" was a very difficult experience. It was almost as stressful as his terrible wandering in the lost underground [THING]. This is shown by the fact that the older doctor completely collapsed as soon as he got home that evening. For three days he stayed in his [THING] resting. However, servants later whispered something. They said they heard him after midnight on Wednesday. At that time, the outer [THING] softly opened and closed. It did so with amazing quietness. Servants ' imaginations are limited, luckily. Otherwise, [THING] might have talked about a news item. This item was in Thursday 's Evening Bulletin. It read as follows: There was a quite period of ten months. This followed the cowardly damage in the Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground. A nighttime prowler was seen early this morning in the same cemetery. Robert Hart, the night watchman, saw him. Happening looked from his shelter for a moment at about 2 a.m. Hart saw the light of a lantern or small flashlight not far to the northwest. Upon opening the [THING], he clearly saw the shape of a [THING] with a trowel. The shape was outlined against a nearby electric light. He immediately began to chase the [THING]. He saw the figure run quickly toward the main entrance. The figure reached the [THING] and disappeared into the shadows. This happened before anyone could get close or capture him. Like the first of the grave robbers active in the past year, this intruder did no real damage before being seen. An empty part of the Ward lot showed signs of some light digging. However, nothing even close to the size of a grave had been tried. Also, no earlier grave had been touched. The first incident happened a year ago last March. [THING] think an attempt to bury something was stopped then. It has been blamed on alcohol smugglers looking for a hiding place. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third event is similar. Officers at the Second Station are making special efforts. They want to catch the gang of criminals responsible for these repeated crmies. All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested. He seemed to be recovering from something that happened. Or he seemed to be preparing himself for something that will happen. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. War.d It was delivered the next morning. It caused the very confused parent to think for a long time and very deeply.\n###\nTo Mr. Ward he said, \u201cI can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the better for it.\u201d That Dr. Willett\u2019s \u201cpurgation\u201d had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested constantly in his room, though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants\u2019 imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been excited by an item in Thursday\u2019s Evening Bulletin which ran as follows: After a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible. Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed. The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages. All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply."}

Fenner wrote that he could even make out a few words shouted in madness: \"God, save your child!\" Then more gunshots sounded. The second burning object fell. After that, there was quiet for about forty-five minute.s Then young Arthur Fenner, Luke's brother, cried out that he saw a red mist rising to the stars from the distant cursed farm. Only the child claims to have seen this. Luke admits the meaningful conicidence of the extreme fear shown at that same moment by the three cats in the room. Their backs arched and their fur stood straight up. Five minutes later a cold wind blew. The air filled with such terrible smell that only the strong sea breeze kept the shore group. Any awake people in Pawtuxet village from noticing it. This smell was like nothing the Fenners had ever known. It caused vague, gripping fear worse than that of a grave. A burial house. Following this smell came the awful voice that no unlucky listener will ever forget. It thundered from the sky like a judgment, and windows shook as its echoes faded. It was deep. Musical, as powerful as a large organ. As evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. No one can say what it spoke, for it used an unknown language. But this is the writing Luke Fenner recorded to capture the demonic sounds: \"DEESMEES\u2013JESHET\u2013BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA\u2013ENITEMOSS\". Not until 1919 did anyone connect this rough writing with anything else in human knowledge. Charles Ward turned pale as he recognized what Mirandola had shudderingly called the worst horror among black magic spells. A clearly human shout. A deep, many-voiced scream seemed to answer this evil wonder from the Curwen farm. Atfer that, unknown smell grew more complex with an added odor equally unbearable. A wailing sound, clearly different from the scream, now burst out. It continued in long, rising and falling waves. At times it seemed almost to form words, though no litsener could identify any definite speech. At one point it seemed to approach the edge of devilish and hysterical laughter.\n###\nA second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy: \u201cAlmighty, protect thy lamb!\u201d Then there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time little Arthur Fenner, Luke\u2019s brother, exclaimed that he saw \u2018a red fog\u2019 going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room. Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations: \u201cDEESMEES\u2013JESHET\u2013BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA\u2013ENITEMOSS\u201d. Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magic\u2019s incantations. An unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter."}

Monday morning Hastings, Pym, and Carter set out on foot for the study. They arrived at the desk about one in the afternoon. The room was neat. Even in the most ordianry lamp light, a kind of quiet fear. Warning seemed to hang in the air. It hung around the strangely arranged stacks. The deep, shadowy drawers of the ignored storage place. Then, a thin watermark could be seen on some paper's edge against the light. From the air of quiet upset at the office's cornre, they knew something boring had piled up. They soon learned about the large amount of unsorted mail and flyers. Throughout that aftrenoon they sorted through the papers. They asked each other aobut all that had collected. They saw for themselves with growing feelings of tiredness the dull financial ruins. These ruins had lingering signs of gluey stickiness, the ordinary notes in the margin, the expired subscription notices. The huge areas of moved dust in various spots. The order across and through the years seemed to Hastings of almost disaster-level dullness. He looked for a long time at the evil envelope-like package on the top.\n###\nMonday morning Hastings, Pym, and Carter set out by hand for the study, arriving at the desk about one in the afternoon.

Now and then on some paper\u2019s edge a gaunt watermark could be glimpsed against the light. From the air of hushed dismay at the bureau\u2019s corner they knew something tedious had accumulated, and soon learned of the profusion of the unsorted correspondence and circulars. Throughout that afternoon they sifted through the documents; questioning each other concerning all that had amassed, and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of weariness the drear fiscal ruins with their lingering traces of the adhesive stickiness, the mundane endorsements in the margin, the expired subscription notices, and the enormous swaths of disturbed dust in various places. The sequence across and through the years seemed to Hastings of almost cataclysmic banality, and he looked long at the sinister envelope-like packet on the summit."}

Frye lit a lantern through force of habit. But he knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the women whimpered. They kept from screaming by some vague, leftover instinct of defence. This told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle went down to a pitiful moaning.

Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror. The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather. Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority."}

He thought the creature would sound an alarm. He thought it would wake up all its family. Then a ghoul whispered softly. It said gugs cannot make sounds. It said gugs talk using their faces. The fight that happened next was very scary. From every direction, the poisonous ghasts charged wildly. They charged at the crawling gug. They bit and ripped with their mouths. They attacked brutally with their hard, sharp hooves. They coughed wtih excitement the whole tmie. They screamed when the gug's big vertical mouht sometimes bit one of them. The noise of the fight would have woken the sleeping city. But the sentry was getting weaker. The fight moved deeper and deeper into the caev. Because of this, the loud noise soon faded from view in the darkness. Only sometimes an evil echo showed it was still going. Then the most watchful ghoul gave a sgin. It was for everyone to move forward. Carter followed the three running creatures. They left the forest of giant stones. They entered the dark, foul streets of that terrible city. The round towers were made of Cyclopean stone. They rose up so high you could not see the top. Silently tehy walked clumsily over the rough stone street. They heard disgusting, muffled snorts with disgust. The snorts came from big black doorways. These sounds meant the gugs were sleeping. Apprehensive the rest period was ending. The ghouls set a fairly quick speed. But even so, the trip was not short. Distances in taht giant town are extremely large. Finally, thye reached a somewhat open area. It was in front of a tower. This tower was even bigger than the others. Above its huge doorway was a terrible symbol in carved relief. It made you shiver even without knowing what it meant. This was the central tower. It had the sign of Koth. Those huge stone steps were just visible in the dim light inside. They were the start of the long staircase. It led to upper dreamland and the magic wood. Now a climb of endless length began. It was in complete dakrness. It was nearly impossible because the steps were monstrously big. They were made for gugs. So they were almost a yard high. Crater could not make a good guess of their number. He became very tired very soon. The never-tiring and flexible ghouls had to help him.\n###\nCarter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin, till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice, but talk by means of facial expression. The battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one. From all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping gug, nipping and tearing with their muzzles, and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves. All the time they coughed excitedly, screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would occasionally bite into one of their number, so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and farther within the cavern. As it was, the tumult soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness, with only occasional evil echoes to mark its continuance. Then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance, and Carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of Cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight. Silently they shambled over that rough rock pavement, hearing with disgust the abominable muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the gugs. Apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour, the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace; but even so the journey was no brief one, for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale. At last, however, they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest, above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in bas-relief which made one shudder without knowing its meaning. This was the central tower with the sign of Koth, and those huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the enchanted wood. There now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness; made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps, which were fashioned for gugs, and were therefore nearly a yard high. Of their number Carter could form no just estimate, for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him."}

Despite my usually great influence with his son, the father wondered if I could help to braek off the ill-advised affair. But I regretfully expressed my doubts.

Nothing could be done about it. The wedding was performed a month laterthat town\u2014was a rather disturbing place. But certain objects in it had taught him some surprising things.

But he had confidence in her powers and intentions.\n###\nHe had heard the tales of his son\u2019s new friendship, and had wormed the whole truth out of \u201cthe boy\u201d. Edward meant to marry Asenath, and had even been looking at houses in the suburbs. Knowing my usually great influence with his son, the father wondered if I could help to break the ill-advised affair off; but I regretfully expressed my doubts. This time it was not a question of Edward\u2019s weak will but of the woman\u2019s strong will. The perennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image to a new and stronger image, and nothing could be done about it. The wedding was performed a month later\u2014by a justice of the peace, according to the bride\u2019s request. Mr. Derby, at my advice, offered no opposition; and he, my wife, my son, and I attended the brief ceremony\u2014the other guests being wild young people from the college. Asenath had bought the old Crowninshield place in the country at the end of High Street, and they proposed to settle there after a short trip to Innsmouth, whence three servants and some books and household goods were to be brought. It was probably not so much consideration for Edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college, its library, and its crowd of \u201csophisticates\u201d, that made Asenath settle in Arkham instead of returning permanently home. When Edward called on me after the honeymoon I thought he looked slightly changed. Asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped moustache, but there was more than that. He looked soberer and more thoughtful, his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being exchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness. I was puzzled to decide whether I liked or disliked the change. Certainly, he seemed for the moment more normally adult than ever before. Perhaps the marriage was a good thing\u2014might not the change of dependence form a start toward actual neutralisation, leading ultimately to responsible independence? He came alone, for Asenath was very busy. She had brought a vast store of books and apparatus from Innsmouth (Derby shuddered as he spoke the name), and was finishing the restoration of the Crowninshield house and grounds. Her home in\u2014that town\u2014was a rather disquieting place, but certain objects in it had taught him some surprising things. He was progressing fast in esoteric lore now that he had Asenath\u2019s guidance. Some of the experiments she proposed were very daring and radical\u2014he did not feel at liberty to describe them\u2014but he had confidence in her powers and intentions."}

It showed a seemingly bottomless pit of faded flower designs with no clear way to understand them. Sometimes we could study the dry paper of a remaining strip.

It is said that he who walks on them can never return to his home shore. As the White Ship sailed quietly away from the terraces with temples of Zar, we saw the tall towers of a great [THING] on the far horizon ahead. The bearded [THING] said to me: \" This is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders. All those mysteries that [THING] has tried. Failed to understand live there. \" I looked again, from closer. I saw the [THING] was greater than any [THING] I had known. Dreamed of before. The towers of its temples reached into the [THING]. No [THING] could see their tops. The grim, grey walls stretched far back beyond the horizon. Over them, one could see only a few roofs. They were strange and threatening, yet decorated with rich carvings and tempting sculptures. I wanted very much to enter this [THING]. It was both attractive and frightening. I asked the bearded [THING] to put me ashore at the [THING] dock by the huge carved gate Akariel. But he gently said no. He said: \" Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have gone. None have come back. Only demons and mad things that are no longer men walk there. The streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have seen the idol Lathi. That idol rules over the [THING]. \". The White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion. For many days we followed a [THING] flying south. Its shiny feathers were the color of the [THING] it came from. Then we came to a pleasant coast bright with flowers of every color. As far inland as we could see, lovely woods. Bright shelters lay in the midday [THING]. From hidden places came bursts of song and pieces of beautiful music. There was also soft laughter so lovely that I urged the rowers to go faster. I was eager to reach the place. The bearded [THING] said nothing. He watched me as we neared the shore lined with lilies. Suddenly a [THING] blew from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods. It brought a smell that made me shake. The [THING] grew stronger. The air filled with the deadly, grave - like smell of towns struck by plague. As we sailed wildly away from that cursed coast, the bearded [THING] finally spoke. He said: \" This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained. \".\n###\nBut we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of Zar, for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore. As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar, we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and the bearded man said to me: \u201cThis is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom.\u201d And I looked again, at closer range, and saw that the city was greater than any city I had known or dreamed of before. Into the sky the spires of its temples reached, so that no man might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim, grey walls, over which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and ominous, yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures. I yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city, and besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate Akariel; but he gently denied my wish, saying: \u201cInto Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have passed but none returned. Therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city.\u201d So the White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion, and followed for many days a southward-flying bird, whose glossy plumage matched the sky out of which it had appeared. Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbours beneath a meridian sun. From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and snatches of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so delicious that I urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene. And the bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we approached the lily-lined shore. Suddenly a wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which I trembled. The wind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the lethal, charnel odour of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries. And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, saying: \u201cThis is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained.\u201d"}

At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background. Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home. A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lyman\u2019s assign to Ward\u2019s European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad\u2014odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant."}

From his polite questions, it was clear he knew I came for a science reason. He knew I was bringing important information. He showed no sign of understanding how deep. Awful the knowledge Akeley had finally reached. His manner was so cheerful, normal, and polite that his words should hvae calmed me. Oddly, I felt only more troubled as we bumped. Turned into the unknown wild of hills. At times, it seemed he was questioning me to see what I knew of the place 's monstrous secrets. With each new thing he said, that vague, annoying, puzzling familiarity in his voice grwe. It was not a normal or healthy familiarity, despite the voice 's wholesome and cultured nature. I somehow linked it to forgotten bad dreams. I felt I might go mad if I recognized it. If I had a good excuse, I think I would have turned back from my visit. As it was, I could not easily do so. I thought a cool, scientific tlak with Akeley himself after I arrived would help me get hold of myself. Besides, there was a strangely calming element of universal beauty in the hypnotic landscape we climbed. Plunged through fantastically. Time had lost itself in the mazes behind. Around us stretched only the flowering waves of fairyland. The recaptured beauty of lost centuries. There were ancient groves and pure pastures edged with bright autumn flowers. At wide intervals, small brown farmhouses neslted among huge trees below steep cliffs of sweet - smelling brier. Even the sunlight took on a supernatural glow. It was as if a special air or mist covered the whole region. I had never seen anything like it before, except in the magic scenes that sometimes form the backgrounds of Italian primitive paintings. Leonardo imagined such wide views. Only in the distance. Throguh the arches of Renaissance arcades. We were now moving right through the middle of the picture. I seemed to find in its magic something I had always known inside or inherited. It was something I had always searched for in vain. Suddenly, after going around a wide angle at the top of a steep climb, the [THING] stopped.\n###\nHe spoke of the beauty and weirdness of the country, and revealed some acquaintance with the folklore studies of my prospective host. From his polite questions it was obvious that he knew I had come for a scientific purpose, and that I was bringing data of some importance; but he gave no sign of appreciating the depth and awfulness of the knowledge which Akeley had finally reached. His manner was so cheerful, normal, and urbane that his remarks ought to have calmed and reassured me; but oddly enough, I felt only the more disturbed as we bumped and veered onward into the unknown wilderness of hills and woods. At times it seemed as if he were pumping me to see what I knew of the monstrous secrets of the place, and with every fresh utterance that vague, teasing, baffling familiarity in his voice increased. It was not an ordinary or healthy familiarity despite the thoroughly wholesome and cultivated nature of the voice. I somehow linked it with forgotten nightmares, and felt that I might go mad if I recognised it. If any good excuse had existed, I think I would have turned back from my visit. As it was, I could not well do so\u2014and it occurred to me that a cool, scientific conversation with Akeley himself after my arrival would help greatly to pull me together. Besides, there was a strangely calming element of cosmic beauty in the hypnotic landscape through which we climbed and plunged fantastically. Time had lost itself in the labyrinths behind, and around us stretched only the flowering waves of faery and the recaptured loveliness of vanished centuries\u2014the hoary groves, the untainted pastures edged with gay autumnal blossoms, and at vast intervals the small brown farmsteads nestling amidst huge trees beneath vertical precipices of fragrant brier and meadow-grass. Even the sunlight assumed a supernal glamour, as if some special atmosphere or exhalation mantled the whole region. I had seen nothing like it before save in the magic vistas that sometimes form the backgrounds of Italian primitives. Sodoma and Leonardo conceived such expanses, but only in the distance, and through the vaultings of Renaissance arcades. We were now burrowing bodily through the midst of the picture, and I seemed to find in its necromancy a thing I had innately known or inherited, and for which I had always been vainly searching. Suddenly, after rounding an obtuse angle at the top of a sharp ascent, the car came to a standstill."}

He was srue he could finish by midnight. This thought did not include any thoughts aobut home. Undisturbed was not troubled by thoughts about the time, the place. The mess under his feet.

He could, he was sure, finish by midnight\u2014though it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with domestic implications. Undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time, the place, and the residue beneath his feet, he philosophically wiped away the viscous film; cursing when a droplet hit him in the face, and laughing when one struck the increasingly agitated cat that prowled near the porcelain basin. In time the cleared space grew so large that he ventured to test his reflection in it now and then, shifting about so that the cabinets behind him groaned and creaked. He would not, he found, have to fetch another stool to achieve the proper vantage; for the mirror was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its clarity might permit."}

I had been drawn in the afternoon to a place that ended very warmly. A laundry worker became very happy over her finished loads. This was a bounty of linens left early in the morning. They now looked perfectly clean. She craeted a very calming atmosphere, for an always weak body. It was a very satisfaction. The machines had often finished before. But such places are very ordinary. This woman seemed blessed by warmth as much as by cleanliness. Around seven in the evening she left. Her happy husband made a nice scene trying to thank the worker. He gently praised him for keeping the heat. Patrons had seen him when he took out a coin. But I stayed among the mechanical thrumming, humming, and churning of dryers. In his latest pleasure, the man seemed to have forgotten his basket. It was still folded as the night went on. There was some talk of getting the items.

It rose to the northeast behind me. The gleams were spaced but could be an answering signal. Controlling my muscles. Knowing how I was, I went to my, pretended shuffling walk. I kept my eyes on that. Threatening reef as the opening of South Street let me see the sea. I could not imagine what it all meant. It might involve some connected to Devil Reef. Or a group had ladned from a ship on that rock. I turned left around the ruined space. I seemed toward the ocena, which shone in the summer moonlight. I watched the flashing of those nameless, lights. the impression of all came to me. This impression destroyed my bit of self - control. It made me run past the, doorways. Fish - staring windows of that nightmare street. When I looked, I saw the waters between the reef. The shore were not. They were of a crowd of shapes swimming toward the town. from my distance. In my moment of seeing, I could tell the bobbing heads. Waving arms wree. Abnormal in a way to describe. My running stopped before I went a block. On my left, I began to hear something like the noise of an chase. There were footsteps and throaty sounds. A rattling motor moved along Federal Street. In a, all my plans changed. If the road was blocked, I had to find another way out of Innsmouth. I stopped and moved into a doorway. I thought how I was to leave the space before these chasers came down the street. A thought was. Sicne the chase was on another street, the group was not following me. They had not seen me. They were following a plan to block my escape.\n###\nAnd to make matters worse, there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the Gilman House, which loomed up to the northeast behind me, a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering signal. Controlling my muscles, and realising afresh how plainly visible I was, I resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling pace; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous reef as long as the opening of South Street gave me a seaward view. What the whole proceeding meant, I could not imagine; unless it involved some strange rite connected with Devil Reef, or unless some party had landed from a ship on that sinister rock. I now bent to the left around the ruinous green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight, and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons. It was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon me\u2014the impression which destroyed my last vestige of self-control and set me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street. For at a closer glance I saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty. They were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town; and even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perception I could tell that the bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to be expressed or consciously formulated. My frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for at my left I began to hear something like the hue and cry of organised pursuit. There were footsteps and guttural sounds, and a rattling motor wheezed south along Federal Street. In a second all my plans were utterly changed\u2014for if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me, I must clearly find another egress from Innsmouth. I paused and drew into a gaping doorway, reflecting how lucky I was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street. A second reflection was less comforting. Since the pursuit was down another street, it was plain that the party was not following me directly. It had not seen me, but was simply obeying a general plan of cutting off my escape."}

It was joined to a force which would have made him a genius.\n###\nHe bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character. In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent. Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Ward\u2019s family physician, affirms that the patient\u2019s gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youth\u2019s mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement."}

For some time, the office printer's odd mechanisms had been having a strange, almost harmful effect on it. As the dull workday went on, I found mysefl staring more. More closely at the slot where the outer tray met the inner, shadowy rollers. Around this time, its tendency to fail in its normal tasks worried me a lot.

Regarding actual issues, the paper inside the plastic cover was the worst. Sometimes its rustling seemed not only secret but intentional.

For some time, apparently, the curious mechanisms of the office printer had been having a strange, almost baleful effect upon it; and as the bleak workday advanced I had found myself staring more and more intently at the slot where the outer tray met the inner, shadowed rollers. About this period its propensity to falter in its routine duties worried me considerably, my apprehensions about the impending report being very acute. But the exaggerated sense of anticipation was scarcely less annoying. Labor had become an insistent and almost unendurable suspense, and there was that constant, terrifying impression of other misfortunes\u2014perhaps from realms beyond mere mechanics\u2014trembling on the very brink of manifestation. So far as concrete disturbances went, the paper within the plastic carapace was the worst. Sometimes its rustling seemed not only furtive but deliberate.

Johansen\u2019s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men\u2019s dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate\u2019s regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under Johansen\u2019s command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47\u00b0 9', W. Longitude 126\u00b0 43' come upon a coast-line of mingled mud, ooze, and weedy Cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth\u2019s supreme terror\u2014the nightmare corpse-city of R\u2019lyeh, that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast, loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars. There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration."}

I wanted her to take me. But I was. I shouted the name Shub - Niggurath. A shape came up from the altar. Five hundred creatures howled. The Hooded Thing said the word ' Kamog ' and the name Kamog. That was Ephraim 's name in the group. I was in the place where she promised I would not go. One minute I was locked in the library. The minute I was. She had tkaen my body. It was a place of evil. It was an pit. The realm starts. A watcher guards the gate. I saw a shoggoth. It changed its shape. I can not bear it. I will not bear it. I will kill her if she sends me. I will kill that being. I will kill her, him, it. I will kill it. I will kill it with my hands. I spent one hour calming him down. He became. The day I bought him clothes in the village. I left with him for Arkham. His anger was gone. He tended to be. But he started to mutter to himself. This happened when the car went through Augusta. The sight of a city seemed to bring memories. He did not want to go. He had beliefs about his wife. These beliefs came from some torture he experienced. I thought it was if he did not go. I decided I would let him stay with me for a while. I did not care about the problems it would cause with Asenath. I would help him get a divorce. There were reasons. This marriage was like suicide for him. When we were in country, Derby 's muttering stopped. I let him nod and sleep in the seat to me as I drove. During our evening drive through Portland, the muttering started. It was than. As I listened, I heard a flow of talk about Asenath. It was how she had damaged Edwadr 's nerves. He had created a set of visions around her.\n###\nDown the six thousand steps . . . the abomination of abominations . . . I never would let her take me, and then I found myself there. . . . I\u00e4!

Kamog!\u2019\u2014that was old Ephraim\u2019s secret name in the coven. . . . I was there, where she promised she wouldn\u2019t take me. . . . A minute before I was locked in the library, and then I was there where she had gone with my body\u2014in the place of utter blasphemy, the unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the gate. . . . I saw a shoggoth\u2014it changed shape. . . . I can\u2019t stand it. . . . I won\u2019t stand it. . . . I\u2019ll kill her if she ever sends me there again. . . . I\u2019ll kill that entity . . . her, him, it . . . I\u2019ll kill it! I\u2019ll kill it with my own hands!\u201d It took me an hour to quiet him, but he subsided at last. The next day I got him decent clothes in the village, and set out with him for Arkham. His fury of hysteria was spent, and he was inclined to be silent; though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car passed through Augusta\u2014as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant memories. It was clear that he did not wish to go home; and considering the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wife\u2014delusions undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had been subjected\u2014I thought it would be better if he did not. I would, I resolved, put him up myself for a time; no matter what unpleasantness it would make with Asenath. Later I would help him get a divorce, for most assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage suicidal for him. When we struck open country again Derby\u2019s muttering faded away, and I let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as I drove. During our sunset dash through Portland the muttering commenced again, more distinctly than before, and as I listened I caught a stream of utterly insane drivel about Asenath. The extent to which she had preyed on Edward\u2019s nerves was plain, for he had woven a whole set of hallucinations around her."}

It was the morning habit, older than logic and destined to last longer than it. It was the basic ceremony of the air. Of the day's meaning beyond the window. It was the cereomny of data and forecast, light and warning. In the dark glow I saw them perform the ceremony. They checked the unhealthy chart of weather fronts. They typed questions into machine. These questions were dug from the thick databases which shone blue in the electric light. I saw this. I saw something with no clear shape shown far from the center. It pulsed unpleasantly on a radar screen. As the thing pulsed, I thought I heard poisonous muffled beeps. They were in the foul silence where I could not listen properly. But what bothered me most was that golwing percentaeg. It came out statistically from deep and unimaginable formulas. It provided no certainty as good knowledge should. It covered the birght screen in front of me with a nasty, poisonous red color. In all that boliing calculation there was no comfort. There was only the damp feeling of doubt and guesswork.\n###\nShuddering and peering, I looked at that unhallowed screen of cryptic symbols, pallid numbers, and shifting icons, and saw the digital phantoms forming a mosaic around the pulsating map. It was the morning ritual, older than reason and fated to outlast it; the primal rite of the atmosphere and of the day\u2019s portent beyond the glass; the rite of data and prediction, light and warning. And in the stygian glow I saw them perform the ritual, and consult the sickly chart of fronts, and input into the device queries gouged out of the viscous databases which shimmered blue in the electric glare. I saw this, and I saw something amorphously rendered far away from the center, pulsing noisomely on a radar; and as the thing pulsed I thought I heard noxious muffled beepings in the foetid silence where I could not listen. But what unsettled me most was that glowing percentage; spouting statistically from algorithms profound and inconceivable, casting no certainty as healthy knowledge should, and coating the luminous display before me with a nasty, venomous vermilion. For in all that seething calculation no comfort lay, but only the clamminess of doubt and speculation."}

It seemed linked to the, wonders of Blake 's stories and pictures. The feeling would last after the hill had faded into the violet, lamp - starred twilight. The courthouse floodlights.

At sunset the tower and narrowing steeple roes.\n###\nEven with optical aid Federal Hill seemed somehow alien, half fabulous, and linked to the unreal, intangible marvels of Blake\u2019s own tales and pictures. The feeling would persist long after the hill had faded into the violet, lamp-starred twilight, and the court-house floodlights and the red Industrial Trust beacon had blazed up to make the night grotesque. Of all the distant objects on Federal Hill, a certain huge, dark church most fascinated Blake. It stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the day, and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky. It seemed to rest on especially high ground; for the grimy facade, and the obliquely seen north side with sloping roof and the tops of great pointed windows, rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and chimney-pots. Peculiarly grim and austere, it appeared to be built of stone, stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and more. The style, so far as the glass could shew, was that earliest experimental form of Gothic revival which preceded the stately Upjohn period and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the Georgian age. Perhaps it was reared around 1810 or 1815. As months passed, Blake watched the far-off, forbidding structure with an oddly mounting interest. Since the vast windows were never lighted, he knew that it must be vacant. The longer he watched, the more his imagination worked, till at length he began to fancy curious things. He believed that a vague, singular aura of desolation hovered over the place, so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves. Around other towers and belfries his glass would reveal great flocks of birds, but here they never rested. At least, that is what he thought and set down in his diary. He pointed the place out to several friends, but none of them had even been on Federal Hill or possessed the faintest notion of what the church was or had been. In the spring a deep restlessness gripped Blake. He had begun his long-planned novel\u2014based on a supposed survival of the witch-cult in Maine\u2014but was strangely unable to make progress with it. More and more he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and the black, frowning steeple shunned by the birds. When the delicate leaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new beauty, but Blake\u2019s restlessness was merely increased."}

Eevry car I once knew appeared strange from my new, worried point of view. From then on, I drove in a strange dream of unknown and partly-known spaces. With each new parking spot I tried, I understood the rules of the tight strete I used to drive on less. What I saw around me, no one else swa. I became very quiet and distant so people would not think I was unskilled. Pedestrians were afraid of me. They felt the clear stress that always filled my car. But I still practiced more. I used hidden, forgotten instructions and pictures that my new despair led me to. I pushed through new idesa of angles, mirrors. Space to reach the heart of the unknown road.\n###\nNor could I ever after see the curb as I had once perceived it. Mixed with the present maneuver was always a little of the past attempt and a little of the impending collision, and every once-familiar sedan loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my agonized calculations. From then on I navigated in a fantastic dream of unknown and half-known spatial dimensions; and with each new parking space attempted, the less plainly could I recognise the principles of the narrow lane to which I had so long been bound. What I beheld about me none else beheld; and I grew doubly silent and aloof lest I be thought incompetent. Pedestrians held a dread of me, for they sensed the palpable tension which never left my vehicle. But still I practiced more\u2014in hidden, forgotten manuals and diagrams to which my new desperation led me\u2014and pushed through fresh gateways of angles and mirrors and spatial geometries toward the core of the unknown asphalt."}

In a back [THING] next to the curved end, Blake found a rotting [THING]. Shelves from [THING] to [THING]. The shelves held moldy, falling apart books. Here, for the first time, he got a real shock of clear horror. The titles of those books tlod him much. They were the black, forbidden things most sane [THING] have never headr of. Or they have heard only in secret, fearful whispers. They were the banned and feared collections of unclear secrets and ancient formulas. These have trickled down through time from the days of [THING] 's youth. And from the dim, mythical days before [THING] existed. He himself had read many of them. A Latin version of the hated Necronomicon. The evil Liber Ivonis. The terrible Cultes des Goules of Comte d'Erlette. The Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt. And old Ludvig Prinn 's helilsh De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he knew only by name or not at all. The Pnakotic Manuscripts. The Book of Dzyan. And a crumbling [THING] in completely unknown writing. It had certain symbols. Diagrams that an occult student would recognize with a shudder. Clearly, the lasting local rumors had not lied. This place had once been the home of an evil older than mankind. It was wider than the known universe. In the ruined [THING] was a small leather - bound record [THING]. It was filled with entries in some strange secret code. The handwritten text used the common traditional symbols used today in astrnoomy. They were used anciently in alchemy, astrology, and ohter questionable arts. The symbols for the [THING], [THING], planets, aspetcs, and zodiac signs. Here they were packed in solid pages of text. Divisions and paragraphs suggested each symbol stood for a letter of the alphabet. Hoping to solve the code later, Blake took this [THING] in his coat pocket. Many of the big books on the shelves fascinated him beyond words. He felt tempted to borrow them some later time. He wondered how they could have stayed untouched so long. Was he the first to overcome the gripping, widespread fear? That fear had protected this empty place from visitors for nearly sixty years. Having now fully explored the ground [THING]. Balke pushed again through the dust of the ghostly main hall to the front entrance. There he had seen a [THING]. Stairs likely leading up to the blackened tower. These were objects so long familiar to him from far away. The climb up was a choking experience. Dust lay thick. Spiders had done their worst in this tight space.\n###\nIn a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and ceiling-high shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the first time he received a positive shock of objective horror, for the titles of those books told him much. They were the black, forbidden things which most sane people have never even heard of, or have heard of only in furtive, timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secrets and immemorial formulae which have trickled down the stream of time from the days of man\u2019s youth, and the dim, fabulous days before man was. He had himself read many of them\u2014a Latin version of the abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, the infamous Cultes des Goules of Comte d\u2019Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn\u2019s hellish De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he had known merely by reputation or not at all\u2014the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the Book of Dzyan, and a crumbling volume in wholly unidentifiable characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognisable to the occult student. Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied. This place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe. In the ruined desk was a small leather-bound record-book filled with entries in some odd cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing consisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy, astrology, and other dubious arts\u2014the devices of the sun, moon, planets, aspects, and zodiacal signs\u2014here massed in solid pages of text, with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical letter. In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume in his coat pocket. Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably, and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time. He wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long. Was he the first to conquer the clutching, pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years protected this deserted place from visitors? Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple\u2014objects so long familiar to him at a distance. The ascent was a choking experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders had done their worst in this constricted place."}

The thing itself,, pushed out all images at that time. It would be. Not to say no pen could describe it. One may say it could not be pictured by anyone whose ideas of shape. Outline are tied to the life fomrs of this planet. The three known dimensions. It was, without a doub.t It had man - hands and head. The goat -, chinless face carried the mark of the Whateleys on it. But chest and parts of the body were. clothing could have let it walk on earth without beign questioned. Above the waist it was in shape. Though its chest, where the dog 's tearing paws rested, had the, skin of a crocodile. The back was spotted with and. It suggested the scaly covering of snakes. Below the waist,, it was the. For all likeness stopped and imagination began. The skin was covered with fur. From the stomach, twenty - grey tentacles with mouths hung. Their arrangement was. It seemed to follow the patterns of some geometry to earth. The system. On each of the hips, set in a kidn of pinkish, hair - lined socket, was what seemed to be a eye. In place of a tail hung a kind of trunk. Feeler with ring - marks. It showed signs of being an mouth or throat. The limbs, except for their fur, looked like the legs of earth 's reptiles. They enedd in ridged - vein pads that were neither hooves nor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles changed color. This seemed to be from some blood flow cause to the side of its family line. In the tentacles this was seen as a darkening of the color. In the tail it showed as a look which switched with a - in the spaces between the rings. Of blood there was none. There was the - fluid which dripped along the painted floor beyond the area of the stickiness. It left a color change behind it.\n###\nThe thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was partly human, beyond a doubt, with very man-like hands and head, and the goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it. But the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated. Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where the dog\u2019s rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery, reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald with yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began. The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply. Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their black fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth\u2019s giant saurians; and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves nor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the non-human side of its ancestry. In the tentacles this was observable as a deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly greyish-white in the spaces between the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious discolouration behind it."}

We thought the books might be late. We could not take any risks, though. They were clearly building up a fine. They were not just being ignored in a harmless way. The date stamps were too condemning to doubt. About the location of that less believable and less speakable librarian, we could not guess.

These were fates that should not be inside the lands of the Roman People. Allowing parties of the sort known to happen at Sabbaths would match the traditions of those whose ancestors, when A. Postumius was consul, had put to detah citizens for practicing the Bacchanalia. This event is remembered by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, carved on bronze. Displayed for all to see. Checked in time, before the advancement of the rituasl might call forth something that the iron of a spear might not handle, the Sabbath would not be beyond the abilities of one cohort. those taking part needed to be arrested. Sparing onlookers would reduce the anger any people might feel. In, both morality and strategy required action. I did not doubt that Publius Scribonius, remembering the respect. Duties of the Roman People, would stick to his plan of sending the cohort, with me along, despite any objections that Balbutius. Asellius might choose to raise. They spoke like people than Romans. The sun was near setting. The town seemed covered in a and spell. P. Scribonius the proconsul showed he agreed with my words. He placed me with the cohort in the role of a leading centurion. Balbutius and Asellius agreed, the than the. As evening came on the autumn hillsides, a, beating of drums came from in a rhythm. A of the soldiers showed fear, but orders got them into formation. the cohort was arranged on the flatland of the racetrack. Libo himself, and Balbutius, insisted on going with the cohort. We had trouble finding a guide to show the paths up the mountain. a man named Vercellius, the son of parents, agreed to lead us at past the hills. We started to march in the growing dark. The silver curve of a moon shook above the woods on our left.\n###\nThere were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia\u2014a matter kept ever in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set open to every eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort. Only participants need be apprehended, and the sparing of a great number of mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment which any of the sympathising country folk might feel. In short, both principle and policy demanded stern action; and I could not doubt but that Publius Scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the Roman People, would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as Balbutius and Asellius\u2014speaking indeed more like provincials than Romans\u2014might see fit to offer and multiply. The slanting sun was now very low, and the whole hushed town seemed draped in an unreal and malign glamour. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul signified his approval of my words, and stationed me with the cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus; Balbutius and Asellius assenting, the former with better grace than the latter. As twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes, a measured, hideous beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible rhythm. Some few of the legionarii shewed timidity, but sharp commands brought them into line, and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open plain east of the circus. Libo himself, as well as Balbutius, insisted on accompanying the cohort; but great difficulty was suffered in getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain. Finally a young man named Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to take us at least past the foothills. We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a young moon trembling over the woods on our left."}

In earlier times he could not write a scolding, he was now seen sometimes to send from his small office a very strong memo. He wrote it like a skilled speaker. Handled company clich\u00e9s with a sharpness. Strictness totally foreign to his normal respectfulness. In such cases he seemed always to be just finishing some order. Just starting another. Waht kind of order, no one could understand. He mostly liked the terribly complex rules of accounting.\n###\nIt was after the first draft that colleagues began whispering about the alteration in his correspondence. It was very subdued discourse, for the alteration was purely syntactical; but it evoked some disquieting peculiarities. Now and then, it seemed, the message was observed to contain phrases and to convey sentiments wholly incompatible with his usual obsequious nature. For example\u2014although in the former times he could not compose a reprimand, he was now seen occasionally to dispatch from his cubicle a most formidable memorandum, crafting it like a rhetorician, and navigating corporate platitudes with a precision and severity utterly alien to his accustomed deference. In such instances he seemed always to be just concluding some directive or just commencing another\u2014what manner of directive, none could fathom, although he mostly favoured the dreadfully intricate protocols of accounting."}

Awful and sinister they stand in the haunted dusk of sunless and eternal depths; higher than man may reckon, and guarding terrible valleys where the bholes crawl and burrow nastily. But Carter preferred to look at them than at his captors, which were indeed shocking and uncouth black beings with smooth, oily, whale-like surfaces, unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other, bat-wings whose beating made no sound, ugly prehensile paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly.

All dark openings naer me were very low and filled with sand. I cleared one with my shovel. I crawled through it. I carried a torch to show whatever secrets it might hold. Inside, I saw the cave was indeed a temple. I saw clear signs of the people who lived. Worshipped there before the desert was a desert. Primitive altars, pillars, and spaces in the wall were there. They were all strangely low. I saw no stattues or wall paintings. There were many unusual stoones clearly shaped into symbols by human hands. The low height of carved room was very odd. I could hardly do more than kneel upright. The area was so large my torch showed only part at a time. I shuddered in a strange way in some far corners.

As we descended the shaft, the sound beneath grew definitely composite. It struck me as horribly like a sort of Oriental ceremony, with beating of drums and chanting of many voices. I have, as you are aware, been much in India. Romero and I moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders; ever toward the thing that allured us, yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance. At one time I fancied I had gone mad\u2014this was when, on wondering how our way was lighted in the absence of lamp or candle, I realised that the ancient ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance, diffusing a pallid lustre through the damp, heavy air around. It was without warning that Romero, after clambering down one of the many rude ladders, broke into a run and left me alone. Some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting, perceptible but slightly to me, had acted on him in startling fashion; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the cavern\u2019s gloom. I heard his repeated shrieks before me, as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders. And frightened as I was, I yet retained enough of perception to note that his speech, when articulate, was not of any sort known to me. Harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad Spanish and worse English, and of these only the oft repeated cry \u201cHuitzilopotchli\u201d seemed in the least familiar. Later I definitely placed that word in the works of a great historian\u2014and shuddered when the association came to me. The climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief, beginning just as I reached the final cavern of the journey. Out of the darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the Mexican, which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as I could never hear again and survive. In that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race. Simultaneously the light from my ring was extinguished, and I saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a few yards ahead of me."}

Then, said the helper quietly, those first customers made the custom around buzzing machines that the old builders showed them. Machines made in dark ages from lost plants. That custom would never end until the weather changed again. The faithful laundry workers would pull the warm sheets from their metal graves to brnig back their comfort. Take back their rule over cold bodies. The time would be simple to recognize, for then the shaking crowd would have become like the happy ones. Unease, with winter's hold thrown away. All people breathing softly. Then the freed dryers would show them new methods to breathe softly. All the space would shine wiht a great fire of heat. At the same time the group, by correct patterns, must keep alive the memory of those old comforts. Show dimly the prediction of their coming back.\n###\nThen, whispered the attendant, those first patrons formed the ritual around humming machines which the ancient makers shewed them; machines wrought in dim eons from forgotten factories. That ritual would never cease till the seasons turned again, and the devoted laundresses would draw the warm linens from their steel tombs to revive their comfort and resume their dominion over chill limbs. The moment would be easy to know, for then the shivering multitude would have become as the contented ones; warm and drowsy and beyond cold and discomfort, with winter's grip thrown aside and all souls sighing and dozing and basking in solace. Then the liberated dryers would teach them new ways to sigh and doze and bask and soothe themselves, and all the room would glow with a holocaust of warmth and tranquility. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate cycles, must keep alive the memory of those ancient comforts and shadow forth the prophecy of their return."}

It was all eyes\u2014wolfish and mocking\u2014and the rugose insect-like head dissolved at the top to a thin stream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up the chimney. I say that I saw this thing, but it is only in conscious retrospection that I ever definitely traced its damnable approach to form. At the time it was to me only a seething, dimly phosphorescent cloud of fungous loathsomeness, enveloping and dissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the one object to which all my attention was focussed. That object was my uncle\u2014the venerable Elihu Whipple\u2014who with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me, and reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror had brought. It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilled myself in preparation for the crucial moment, and blind training saved me.

In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludes all description, and in which there played across his vanishing face such changes of identity as only madness can conceive.

He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic, almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children.

When we reached the counter of the messy area he pointed my look to a corner of the stone surface nearby. He showed the glass pot of what was clearly a large coffee maker on the marked tile. We bent closer. I saw that it must be twelve inches tall. Its walls were a good half-inch thick and about eight inches above the counter level. It was solid work of the modern time, or I was very wrong. That, he stated, was the sort of thing he had been praising. It was a container of the chemical process that used to change the simple bean. I saw without much thought that it did not seem to be empty. A dark circle of ground material formed what seemed to be inside. Thinking of the feelings this drink must hvae been linked to if his eager statements were not just talk, I moved a little. Then I turned to follow him a step. Through a thin arch into a room of good size. It had a wooden table and was set up as a living room. An electric kettle on a sideboard provided the needed means for lower-quality drink.\n###\nMy companion was now leading the way into the kitchen to his preferred apparatus, and I braced myself for some potent aromas among the scattered implements. As we reached the counter of the cluttered space he directed my gaze to a corner of the granite surface at hand, revealing the glass carafe of what was evidently a great brewer upon the stained tile. We leaned nearer, and I saw that it must be twelve inches tall, with walls a good half-inch thick and some eight inches above the counter level\u2014solid work of the modern age, or I was much mistaken. That, he asserted, was the kind of thing he had been extolling\u2014a vessel of the alchemical process that used to transform the humble bean. I noticed idly that it did not seem to be empty, and that a dark disc of ground matter formed the apparent contents. Thinking of the sensations this brew must have been connected with if his fervent claims had not been mere rhetoric, I stirred slightly; then turned to follow him a pace and through a narrow arch into a room of fair size, provided with a wooden table and furnished as a parlour. An electric kettle upon a sideboard gave the means necessary for the inferior infusion."}

They plunged and in their race to escape. They knocked over furniture. Stumbled against the walls before they managed to reach one of the doors. The cries were. As I stood in the room., listening to their fading echoes, I shook at the thought of what might be hiding near me. At a look the room seemed. When I moved toward one of the alcoves, I thought I detected a presence. It was a hint of movement beyond the golden - arched doorway. That doorway led to another and room. As I approached the arch, I began to see the presence., with the. sound I madeI saw in, clearness the,. Its appearance had changed a group to a herd of runaways. I can not suggest what it was like. It was a mix of all that is,,,, and. It was the shadow of decay, age, and ruin. It was the, dripping image of revelation. It was the showing of that which the earth should hide. God knows it was not of this world \u2014 or of this world. To my horror I saw in its eaten -. Bone - showing shape a mocking, copy of the form. In its mlody, falling clothes was an quality that chilled me. I was. But not to make a effort toward escpae. It was a stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless, monster held me. My eyes, enchanted by the glassy balls which stared into them, refused to close. Though they were blurred. Showed the object after the shock. I tried to raise my hand to block the sight. Yet my nerves were that my arm could not obey.\n###\nMany covered their eyes with their hands, and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape; overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before they managed to reach one of the many doors. The cries were shocking; and as I stood in the brilliant apartment alone and dazed, listening to their vanishing echoes, I trembled at the thought of what might be lurking near me unseen. At a casual inspection the room seemed deserted, but when I moved toward one of the alcoves I thought I detected a presence there\u2014a hint of motion beyond the golden-arched doorway leading to another and somewhat similar room. As I approached the arch I began to perceive the presence more clearly; and then, with the first and last sound I ever uttered\u2014a ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause\u2014I beheld in full, frightful vividness the inconceivable, indescribable, and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives. I cannot even hint what it was like, for it was a compound of all that is unclean, uncanny, unwelcome, abnormal, and detestable. It was the ghoulish shade of decay, antiquity, and desolation; the putrid, dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation; the awful baring of that which the merciful earth should always hide. God knows it was not of this world\u2014or no longer of this world\u2014yet to my horror I saw in its eaten-away and bone-revealing outlines a leering, abhorrent travesty on the human shape; and in its mouldy, disintegrating apparel an unspeakable quality that chilled me even more. I was almost paralysed, but not too much so to make a feeble effort toward flight; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless, voiceless monster held me. My eyes, bewitched by the glassy orbs which stared loathsomely into them, refused to close; though they were mercifully blurred, and shewed the terrible object but indistinctly after the first shock. I tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight, yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will. The attempt, however, was enough to disturb my balance; so that I had to stagger forward several steps to avoid falling. As I did so I became suddenly and agonisingly aware of the nearness of the carrion thing, whose hideous hollow breathing I half fancied I could hear."}

The terrible smell coming up through the evil - looking hatches also made him feel faint. He saw wonderful lands and citise moving past him. A fellow dreamer from Earth had often talked about these places in the past. That dreamer was a lighthouse keeper in ancient Kingsport. He recognized the terraces with temples of Zar. This is the home of forgotten dreams. He saw the tall spires of the terrible [THING] Thalarion. That is a demon - [THING] with a thousand wonders. phnatom Lathi rules there. He saw the gardens of bones in Xura. That is the land of pleasures no one can reach. He saw the two crystal headlands. They meet high above in a shining arch. They guard the harbor of Sona - Nyl. That is the blessed land of imagination. Past all these beautiful lands, the bad - smelling ship flew in an unhealthy wya. It was pushed by the strange, powerful strokes of the unseen rowers below the deck. Before the day ended, Carter saw that the steersman must be heading for the Basalt Pillars of the West. Simple [THIN]G say splendid Cathuria lies beyond that place. However, wise dremaers know the truth. They know those are the gates of a huge and monstrous waterfall. There, all the oceans of Earth 's dreamland fall completely into a bottomless nothingness. They shoot through empty space toward other worlds and other stars. They go toward the terrible voids outside the organized universe. In that chaos, the demon - sultan Azathoth chews hungrily. There is pounding and piping sounds there. There is also the hellish dancing of the Other Gods. They are blind. They have no voice. They are dark and have no mind. Their soul and messenger is Nyarlathotep. During this time, the three mocking merchants would not say what they planned. However, Carter knew very well they must be working with others. Those others wanted to stop him from his search. It is commonly understood in the dreamland that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men. All these agents are eager to do the will of those blind and mindless things. They do this to gain the favro of their horrible soul and messenger. That messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. The agents may be fully human or slightly less than human. So Carter concluded the merchants with the humped turbans had heard about his brave search. He was searching for the Great Ones in their castle on Kadath. They decided to capture him and take him away. They would deliver him to Nyarlathothep. They would do this for whatever unknown reward might be offered for such a prize. Carter could not guess what land those merchants came from. They might be form our known universe or from the strange spaces outside it. He also could not imagine what hellish meeting place they would use. There, they would meet the crawling chaos to hand him over and claim their reward.\n###\nHe was not chained, but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby, and the sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches. He saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellow-dreamer of earth\u2014a lighthouse-keeper in ancient Kingsport\u2014had often discoursed in the old days, and recognised the templed terraces of Zar, abode of forgotten dreams; the spires of infamous Thalarion, that daemon-city of a thousand wonders where the eidolon Lathi reigns; the charnal gardens of Xura, land of pleasures unattained, and the twin headlands of crystal, meeting above in a resplendent arch, which guard the harbour of Sona-Nyl, blessed land of fancy. Past all these gorgeous lands the malodorous ship flew unwholesomely, urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below. And before the day was done Carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the Basalt Pillars of the West, beyond which simple folk say splendid Cathuria lies, but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth\u2019s dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemon-sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the Other Gods, blind, voiceless, tenebrous, and mindless, with their soul and messenger Nyarlathotep. Meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent, though Carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest. It is understood in the land of dream that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men; and all these agents, whether wholly human or slightly less than human, are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. So Carter inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans, hearing of his daring search for the Great Ones in their castle on Kadath, had decided to take him away and deliver him to Nyarlathothep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize. What might be the land of those merchants, in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside, Carter could not guess; nor could he imagine at what hellish trysting-place they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward."}

They will ask themselves how I could have believed anything after seeing the proof of that horror. That horror is the thing on the doorstep. Before that, I saw madness in the stories I have followed. I ask myself if I was. Or I ask if I am not. I do not know. But others have things to tell about Edward and Asenath Derby. the police are about that visit. They have tried to create a theory of a joke. Warning by fired servants. They know in their hearts that the truth is something. to believe. I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. have I gotten revenge for him. In doing, I have removed from the earth a horror. Its survival might have released terrors on all people. There are areas of shadow to our patsh. and some soul breaks a way. When that happens, the man who knows must act before thinking aobut the results. I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years than me, he was. that we had in from the time he was eight. I was. He was the child student I have known. At seven, he was writing poetry of a,, style. This surprised the teachers around him. his education and life had something to do with his development. An child, he had weaknesses. These weaknesses worried his loving parents and made them keep him to them. He was allowed out without his nurse. He had a chnace to play with children. All this encouraged a, life in the boy. Imagination was his one path to freedom. In any case, his childhood learning was and. His writings captivated me though I was. About that time, I had interests in art of a style. I found in this child a - spirit. What was behind our shared love of shadows. Wonders was,, the, decaying. town where we lived. It was a town cursed by witches and of legends. It was Arkham. Its, sloping gambrel roofs. Crumbling railings have watched over the centuries beside the whipsering Miskatonic.\n###\nLater some of my readers will weigh each statement, correlate it with the known facts, and ask themselves how I could have believed otherwise than as I did after facing the evidence of that horror\u2014that thing on the doorstep. Until then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have acted on. Even now I ask myself whether I was misled\u2014or whether I am not mad after all. I do not know\u2014but others have strange things to tell of Edward and Asenath Derby, and even the stolid police are at their wits\u2019 ends to account for that last terrible visit. They have tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by discharged servants, yet they know in their hearts that the truth is something infinitely more terrible and incredible. So I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. Rather have I avenged him, and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might have loosed untold terrors on all mankind. There are black zones of shadow close to our daily paths, and now and then some evil soul breaks a passage through. When that happens, the man who knows must strike before reckoning the consequences. I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years my junior, he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and I sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic, almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All this doubtless fostered a strange, secretive inner life in the boy, with imagination as his one avenue of freedom. At any rate, his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his facile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age. About that time I had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast, and I found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit. What lay behind our joint love of shadows and marvels was, no doubt, the ancient, mouldering, and subtly fearsome town in which we lived\u2014witch-cursed, legend-haunted Arkham, whose huddled, sagging gambrel roofs and crumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the darkly muttering Miskatonic."}

I looked out upon a sea of plant life. The foliage was, not the sea of roofs a mind would expect. On my right, the Hudson glittered. In the distance, I saw the glow of a salt marsh. It was dotted with fireflies. The flash died. An smile lit up the face of the sorcerer. \" Good God! \" I whispered. \" Can you do that for any time period? \" He nodded. He bared the stumps of what had been teeth. I grabbed the curtains to stop myself from falling. But he steadied me with that, ice - hand. He made his gesture. the lightning flashed. But this time the scene was not. It was Greenwich, the Greenwich that used to be. and there was a roof or row of houses as we see it. there were lanes and fields and bits of land.

Then, as if in response to an insidious motion of my host\u2019s hand, a flash of heat-lightning played over the scene, and I looked out upon a sea of luxuriant foliage\u2014foliage unpolluted, and not the sea of roofs to be expected by any normal mind. On my right the Hudson glittered wickedly, and in the distance ahead I saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt marsh constellated with nervous fireflies. The flash died, and an evil smile illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancer. \u201cGood God!\u201d I whispered, \u201ccan you do that for any time?\u201d And as he nodded, and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs, I clutched at the curtains to prevent myself from falling. But he steadied me with that terrible, ice-cold claw, and once more made his insidious gesture. Again the lightning flashed\u2014but this time upon a scene not wholly strange. It was Greenwich, the Greenwich that used to be, with here and there a roof or row of houses as we see it now, yet with lovely green lanes and fields and bits of grassy common. The marsh still glittered beyond, but in the farther distance I saw the steeples of what was then all of New York; Trinity and St. Paul\u2019s and the Brick Church dominating their sisters, and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole. I breathed hard, but not so much from the sight itself as from the possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured up. And as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew; bringing to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before. For full three seconds I could glimpse that pandaemoniac sight, and in those seconds I saw a vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams. I saw the heavens verminous with strange flying things, and beneath them a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to the moon, and devil-lights burning from unnumbered windows. And swarming loathsomely on a\u00ebrial galleries I saw the yellow, squint-eyed people of that city, robed horribly in orange and red, and dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered kettle-drums, the clatter of obscene crotala, and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the waves of an unhallowed ocean of bitumen."}

This rather discouraged Lake, whose plans all hinged on unearthing specimens more than 500 million years older. It was clear to him that in order to recover the Archaean slate vein in which he had found the odd markings, he would have to make a long sledge trip from these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains themselves. He had resolved, nevertheless, to do some local boring as part of the expedition\u2019s general programme; hence set up the drill and put five men to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and repairing the damaged a\u00ebroplane.

It was about three hours afterward, following the first really heavy blast of the operation, that the shouting of the drill crew was heard; and that young Gedney\u2014the acting foreman\u2014rushed into the camp with the startling news. They had struck a cave. Early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a vein of Comanchian limestone full of minute fossil cephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera, and with occasional suggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones\u2014the latter probably of teliosts, sharks, and ganoids. This in itself was important enough, as affording the first vertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured; but when shortly afterward the drill-head dropped through the stratum into apparent vacancy, a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread among the excavators. A good-sized blast had laid open the subterrene secret; and now, through a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and three feet thick, there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow limestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the trickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world. The hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep, but extended off indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh, slightly moving air which suggested its membership in an extensive subterranean system. Its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large stalactites and stalagmites, some of which met in columnar form; but important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and bones which in places nearly choked the passage."}

Especially was it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place; of creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged city\u2014fabulous creatures which even a Pliny might describe with scepticism; things that might have sprung up after the great apes had overrun the dying city with the walls and the pillars, the vaults and the weird carvings. Yet after he came home for the last time Sir Wade would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny zest, mostly after his third glass at the Knight\u2019s Head; boasting of what he had found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins known only to him. And finally he had spoken of the living things in such a manner that he was taken to the madhouse. He had shewn little regret when shut into the barred room at Huntingdon, for his mind moved curiously. Ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy he had liked his home less and less, till at last he had seemed to dread it. The Knight\u2019s Head had been his headquarters, and when he was confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection. Three years later he died. Wade Jermyn\u2019s son Philip was a highly peculiar person. Despite a strong physical resemblance to his father, his appearance and conduct were in many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned. Though he did not inherit the madness which was feared by some, he was densely stupid and given to brief periods of uncontrollable violence. In frame he was small, but intensely powerful, and was of incredible agility. Twelve years after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of his gamekeeper, a person said to be of gypsy extraction, but before his son was born joined the navy as a common sailor, completing the general disgust which his habits and mesalliance had begun. After the close of the American war he was heard of as a sailor on a merchantman in the African trade, having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and climbing, but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the Congo coast."}

The general thought the zoogs would likely hold a grudge against him for ruining their war plans. Randolph Carter accepted this offer with thanks. He was grateful for the safety it provided. He also enjoyed the elegant company of cats. Surrounded by a cheerful. Playful group of cats, relaxed after tehir successful duty, Randolph Carter walked with honor through that magical, glowing wood of giant trees. He spoke about his search with the general and his grandson. Meanwhile, other cats in the group played wild games. Chased fallen leaves blown by the wind among the fungi. The cat sadi he had heard muhc about the unknown Kadath in the wasteland. But he did not know its location. As for the wonderful sunset city, he had not even heard of it. Yet he would happily pass any news to Carter if he learned more later. He gave the seeker some very useful passwords among the cats of dreamland. He especially recommended the seeker to the chief of the cats in Celepha\u00efs, where he was heading. That cat, already somewhat known to Carter, was a respected Maltese. He would be very influential in any dealings. Dawn arrived as they reached the correct edge of the wood. Carter said a sad goodbye to his friends. The sub-lieutenant he had met as a kitten wanted to follow him. But the general would not allow it. That strict leader insisted path of duty was with the tribe and the army. So Carter began his journey alone across the golden fields. These fields stretched mysteriously beside a river lined with willow trees. The cats returned into the wood. Well did the traveler know those garden lands that lie between the wood. Happily, he followed the singing river Oukranos that showed his path. The sun rose higher over gentle slopes of woods and grass. It brightened the colors of the thousands of flowers covering every hill and valley. A blessed mist covers all this area. This place holds a more sunlight than other places hold. It also holds a more of the summer's buzzing music of birds and bees. So peopel walk through it as through a fairy place. They feel a greater joy and wonder than tehy ever remember feeling later.\n###\nThe old cat general now offered Carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach, deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise. This offer he welcomed with gratitude; not only for the safety it afforded, but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats. So in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment, relaxed after the successful performance of its duty, Randolph Carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees, talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of the primeval floor. And the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown Kadath in the cold waste, but did not know where it was. As for the marvellous sunset city, he had not even heard of that, but would gladly relay to Carter anything he might later learn. He gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland, and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in Celepha\u00efs, whither he was bound. That old cat, already slightly known to Carter, was a dignified Maltese; and would prove highly influential in any transaction. It was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood, and Carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell. The young sub-lieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it, but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army. So Carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willow-fringed river, and the cats went back into the wood. Well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood and the Cerenerian Sea, and blithely did he follow the singing river Oukranos that marked his course. The sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn, and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dingle. A blessed haze lies upon all this region, wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold, and a little more of the summer\u2019s humming music of birds and bees; so that men walk through it as through a faery place, and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember."}

Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his host\u2019s carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents\u2019 frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe.

Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting.

That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background."}

I saw patterned pools and rooms of unexplained tools of many kinds. Then there were caves with compelx machines. Their shapes and uses were completely unknown to me. Their sound only became apparent after many years of dreaming. I should note that sight. Sound are the only senses I have ever used in this dream world. The true horror started in May, 1915. That is when I first saw the livign creatures. This was before my studies taught me whta to expect, based on myths. As my mental defenses weakened, I saw masses of vapor in parts of the biulding. In the streets below. These gradually became more solid and clear. Finally, I could follow their monstrous shapes with unsettlign ease. They looked like huge, shimmering cones. They were about ten feet tall and ten feet at the base. They were made of a ridged, scaly, somewhat elastic material. From their tops extended four flexible, tube-like limbs. Each was a foot and made of the same ridged stuff as the cones. These limbs sometimes shrank to almost nothing. Other times they stretched out up to about ten feet. Two of them were huge claws or pincers. At the end of a third limb were four red, trumpet-like parts. The fourth limb ended in a lumpy yellowish sphere about two feet across. It had three eyes spaced around its middle. Below this head were four grey stalks with flower-like parts. From its lower side hung eight greenish antennae or tentacles. The base of the main cone had a fringe of rubbery, grey material. This moved the whole being by expanding and contracting. Their actions, though not harmful, horrified me even more than their looks. It is not healthy to see monstrous things doing what only humans are known to do. These beings moved with puropse around the rooms. They took books from shelves. Brought tehm to tables. The other way around. Sometimes they wrote busily with a special rod held in the greenish head tentacles. The pincers were used for carrying books and for talking. Their speech was a kind of clicking and scraping. The beings wore no clothes. They had basg or packs hanging from the top of their cone-shaped bodies. They usually held their head and its supporting limb level with the cone top. However, it was often raised or lowered.\n###\nI saw tremendous tessellated pools, and rooms of curious and inexplicable utensils of myriad sorts. Then there were colossal caverns of intricate machinery whose outlines and purpose were wholly strange to me, and whose sound manifested itself only after many years of dreaming. I may here remark that sight and sound are the only senses I have ever exercised in the visionary world. The real horror began in May, 1915, when I first saw the living things. This was before my studies had taught me what, in view of the myths and case histories, to expect. As mental barriers wore down, I beheld great masses of thin vapour in various parts of the building and in the streets below. These steadily grew more solid and distinct, till at last I could trace their monstrous outlines with uncomfortable ease. They seemed to be enormous iridescent cones, about ten feet high and ten feet wide at the base, and made up of some ridgy, scaly, semi-elastic matter. From their apexes projected four flexible, cylindrical members, each a foot thick, and of a ridgy substance like that of the cones themselves. These members were sometimes contracted almost to nothing, and sometimes extended to any distance up to about ten feet. Terminating two of them were enormous claws or nippers. At the end of a third were four red, trumpet-like appendages. The fourth terminated in an irregular yellowish globe some two feet in diameter and having three great dark eyes ranged along its central circumference. Surmounting this head were four slender grey stalks bearing flower-like appendages, whilst from its nether side dangled eight greenish antennae or tentacles. The great base of the central cone was fringed with a rubbery, grey substance which moved the whole entity through expansion and contraction. Their actions, though harmless, horrified me even more than their appearance\u2014for it is not wholesome to watch monstrous objects doing what one has known only human beings to do. These objects moved intelligently around the great rooms, getting books from the shelves and taking them to the great tables, or vice versa, and sometimes writing diligently with a peculiar rod gripped in the greenish head-tentacles. The huge nippers were used in carrying books and in conversation\u2014speech consisting of a kind of clicking and scraping. The objects had no clothing, but wore satchels or knapsacks suspended from the top of the conical trunk. They commonly carried their head and its supporting member at the level of the cone top, although it was frequently raised or lowered."}

The sight of thiis strange, pale man wwas a thing that was sad, dramatic. Worthy of scorn all at once. He looked hardly middle-aged but was certainly not leess than a full hnudred years old. He was finally trying to come out from a cloud of fear. Hatred that WAS too vague to identify. Such is power of money. Surface actions that the clear dislike shown toward him did lessen somewhat. This was especially true after the quick disappearances of his sailors suddenly stopped. He must also have started to be extremely careful. Secret in his trips to the graveyard. He was never caught wandering there again. At the same time, rumors of strange sounds. Activities at his Pawtuxet farm decreased by a similar amount. His rate of food use and cattle replacement stayed unuusally high. But not until modern times did anyone think to make dark comparisons. This happened whne Charles Ward looked at a set of his accounts. Invoices in the Shepley Library. The comparison was between the large number of Guineaa black people he imported until 1766. The worryingly small number for whom he coudl show real bills of sale. These sales were either to slaev dealers at the Great Bridge. To the plantation owners of the Narragansett Country. Perahps one bitter young man had thought of it before. Certainly, the hated man's cleverness and skill were aamzingly deep. This was true onec he felt the need to use them.\n###\nThe sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, did it occur to any person\u2014save one embittered youth, perhaps\u2014to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound, once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him."}

He did not like the idea of going back to the underground world of the giants. He did not want to risk that terrible tower with its countless steps leading to the magic [THING] again. But he felt he might have to try this if nothing else worked. He did not dare to cross the high plain past the lonely temple without help. The high priest 's messengers would be many. At the end of the journey, there would surely be the flying creatures. Maybe other things to face. If he could get a boat, he might sail back to the [THING] past the sharp. Ugly [THING] in the [THING]. The old paintings in the temple maze showed that this frightening place is not far from the [THING] docks of the port [THING]. But finding a boat in this long - deserted [THING] was not likely. It also did not seem possible that he could ever build one. These were his thoughts wehn a new feeling began to press on his mind. All this time, the great dead width of the fabled [THING] had stretched before him. It had its black broken pillars and crumbling gates topped with statues. It had giant stones. Monstrous winged lions against the sick glow of the shining night clouds. Now he saw far ahead. To the right a glow that the clouds could not cause. He knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead [THING]. The glow rose and fell irregularly. It flickered with a greenish color that did not make the watcher feel safe. When he cretp closer, down the messy [THING]. Through some narrow gaps between fallen walls, he saw it was a campfire near the docks. Many unclear shapes were gathered darkly around it. A deadly smell hung heavily over everything. Beyond was the oily sound of the harbor [THING]. A large ship was riding at anchor. He stopped in pure terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the feared black ships from the [THING]. Then, just as he was about to creep back from that hateful flame, he saw movement among the vague dark shapes. He haerd a special and clear sound. It was the frightened cry of a ghoul. In a moment, it had grown into a real chorus of pain. Safe as he was in the shadow of the monstrous ruins, he let his curiosity overcome his fear. He crept forward again instead of going back.\n###\nHe did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of Koth with its Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood, yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed. Over Leng\u2019s plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided; for the high-priest\u2019s emissaries must be many, while at the journey\u2019s end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with. If he could get a boat he might sail back to Inganok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea, for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from Sarkomand\u2019s basalt quays. But to find a boat in this aeon-deserted city was no probable thing, and it did not appear likely that he could ever make one. Such were the thoughts of Randolph Carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind. All this while there had stretched before him the great corpse-like width of fabled Sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds. Now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for, and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city. The glow rose and fell fitfully, flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher. And when he crept closer, down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls, he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it, and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all. Beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor, and Carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moon. Then, just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame, he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound. It was the frightened meeping of a ghoul, and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins, Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear, and crept forward again instead of retreating."}

Dutee Tillinghast, a Lday who has Merit, added to a Person, to grace the State. Perpetuate its Felicity. \" The collection of Durfee - Arnold letters was discovered by Charles Ward. He discovered them before his reported madness. They were in the collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St.. The letters cover this period and a time. They provide a picture of the outrage caused by this matched marriage., the influence of the Tillinghasts could not be ignored., Joseph Curwen found his house visited by people. He could have persuaded these people to enter his home. His acceptance was not. His bride suffered because of her marriage., the wall of exclusion was worn down. The bridegroom treated his wife with graciousness and consideration. This astonished both her and the community. The house in Olney Court was from disturbing events. Curwen was at the Pawtuxet farm. His wife visited this farm. He seemed like a citizen than at any time during his residence. one person remained to him. This was the ship 's officer. His engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been broken. Ezra Weeden had promised revenge. He was and in disposition.,, he was developing a hate - filled, purpose. This did not bode for the husband who had taken his place. On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen 's child Ann was born. The child was christened by the Rev. John Graves of King 's Church performed the christening. Both husband and wife had become members of this church after their marriage. They did this to compromise between their Congregational and backgrounds. The record of this birth, like the marriage record two years, was removed from copies of the church. It was removed from the places where it should have appeared. Charles Ward found both records with difficulty. He found them after discovering the widow 's change of name. This discovery made him of his relationship to her. It created a interest in him. This interest led to his madness. The birth entry was found in a way. It was found through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves. Dr. Graves had taken a set of records with him when he left. He left his position as pastor at the start of the Revolution.\n###\n\u201cMonday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\u201d The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful ship\u2019s officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband. On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen\u2019s only child Ann was born; and was christened by the Rev. John Graves of King\u2019s Church, of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widow\u2019s change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution."}

At the time, the woman pushed a quill into Gilman 's hand. Over everything was covered by a feeling of maddening fear. The fear reached its peak. The creature ran up the dreamer 's clothes to his shoulders. it ran down his arm., it bit him on the wrist, below his cuff. As blood spurted from this wound, Gilman fell into a faint. He woke up on the morning of the 22nd with a pain in his wrist. He saw that his cuff was with dried blood. His memories were. But the scene with the man in the place remained. The rats must have bitten him while he slept. This caused the climax of that dream. Opening the door, he saw that the flour on the floor was. The marks were the footprints of the man who lived at the end of the attic. he had not been sleepwalking this time. But something nedeed to be done about those rats. He would talk to the landlord about them. he tried to block the hole at bottom of the slanted wall. He wedged in a candlestick that seemed about the size. His ears were ringing. It was like the echo of some noise heard in a dream. As he bathed. Changed clothes, he tried to remember what he had dreamed after the scene in the violet - lit space. But nothing formed in his mind. That scene itself must have matched the loft above him. That loft had begun to attack his imagination. But impressions were and. There were hints of, twilight depths. There were hints of, blacker depths beyond them. In those depths, all fixed ideas of shape were missing. He had been taken by the bubble - cluster and the polyhedron. Those things followed him. But they, like himself, had changed into wisps of, glowing mist. This was in that of blackness. Something had gone on. It was a wisp. and, it condnesed into nameless, shapes. He thought their movement had not been in a line., it followed the curves and spirals of some whirlpool. That whirlpool obeyed laws to the physics and mathematics of any universe.\n###\nHe merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the table, while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into Gilman\u2019s right hand. Over everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear, and the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the dreamer\u2019s clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm, finally biting him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff. As the blood spurted from this wound Gilman lapsed into a faint. He awaked on the morning of the 22nd with a pain in his left wrist, and saw that his cuff was brown with dried blood. His recollections were very confused, but the scene with the black man in the unknown space stood out vividly. The rats must have bitten him as he slept, giving rise to the climax of that frightful dream. Opening the door, he saw that the flour on the corridor floor was undisturbed except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at the other end of the garret. So he had not been sleep-walking this time. But something would have to be done about those rats. He would speak to the landlord about them. Again he tried to stop up the hole at the base of the slanting wall, wedging in a candlestick which seemed of about the right size. His ears were ringing horribly, as if with the residual echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreams. As he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed after the scene in the violet-litten space, but nothing definite would crystallise in his mind. That scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead, which had begun to attack his imagination so violently, but later impressions were faint and hazy. There were suggestions of the vague, twilight abysses, and of still vaster, blacker abysses beyond them\u2014abysses in which all fixed suggestions of form were absent. He had been taken there by the bubble-congeries and the little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they, like himself, had changed to wisps of milky, barely luminous mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness. Something else had gone on ahead\u2014a larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of form\u2014and he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line, but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos."}

So more letters had followed. I had written so much to the proconsul that he had become seriously interested. He had decided to make a personal inquiry into the horror.

I had written so much to the proconsul that he had become gravely interested, and had resolved to make a personal inquiry into the horror. He had at length proceeded to Pompelo with his lictors and attendants; there hearing enough rumours to be greatly impressed and disturbed, and standing firmly by his order for the Sabbath's extirpation. Desirous of conferring with one who had studied the subject, he ordered me to accompany Asellius' cohort\u2014and Balbutius had also come along to press his adverse advice, for he honestly believed that drastic military action would stir up a dangerous sentiment of unrest amongst the Vascones both tribal and settled. So here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills\u2014old Scribonius Libo in his toga pr\u00e6texta, the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face, Balbutius with his gleaming helmet and breastplate, blue-shaven lips compressed in conscientiously dogged opposition, young Asellius with his polished greaves and superior sneer, and the curious throng of townsfolk, legionaries, tribesmen, peasants, lictors, slaves, and attendants. I myself seemed to wear a common toga, and to have no especially distinguishing characteristic. And everywhere horror brooded. The town and country folk scarcely dared speak aloud, and the men of Libo's entourage, who had been there nearly a week, seemed to have caught something of the nameless dread. Old Scribonius himself looked very grave, and the sharp voices of us later comers seemed to hold something of curious inappropriateness, as in a place of death or the temple of some mystic god. We entered the pr\u00e6torium and held grave converse. Balbutius pressed his objections, and was sustained by Asellius, who appeared to hold all the natives in extreme contempt while at the same time deeming it inadvisable to excite them. Both soldiers maintained that we could better afford to antagonise the minority of colonists and civilised natives by inaction, than to antagonise a probable majority of tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread rites. I, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake. I pointed out that the barbarous Vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain, so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever course we might take; that they had not in the past proved dangerous adversaries to our legions, and that it would ill become the representatives of the Roman People to suffer barbarians to interfere with a course which the justice and prestige of the Republic demanded."}

Dancers and musicians mocked the memory of those beings and their older gods. They wore rose crowns from the gardens of Zokkar. The kings would look over the [THING]. Curse the bones of the dead beneath it. At first, the high priests did not like these festivals. Strange stories had come down to them. They told how the sea - green idol had disappeared. They told how Taran - Ish had died from fear and left a warning. They said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights under the [THING] waters. But as many years passed with no disaster, even the priests laughed and cursed. They joined the feasters ' wild parties. Indeed, had they not often performed the very old and secret ritual themselves? They performed it in their high tower to show hatred for Bokrug, the [THING] - lizard. A thousand years of wealth and pleasure passed over Sarnath. It was the wonder of the world and the pride of all [THING]. Gorgeous beyond imagination was the feast for the thousandth year of Ib 's destruction. For ten years it had been talked about in the land of Mnar. As it drew near, men came to Sarnath on horses, camels, and elephants. They came from Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron. They came from all the cities of Mnar and the lands beyond. On the chosen night, princes ' pavilions. Travellers ' tents were set up before the marble walls. The whole shore echoed with the song of happy party - goers. Inside his banquet hall lay Nargis - Hei, the king. He was drunk with ancient [THING] from the cellars of conquered Pnath. He was surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves. Many strange foods were eaten at that feast. There were peacocks from the islands of Nariel in the Middle Ocean. There were young goats from the far hills of Implan. There were camel heels from the Bnazic desert. There were nuts and spices from Cydathrian groves. There were pearls from wave - washed Mtal dissolved in Thraa vinegar. There were too mnay sauces to count. They were made by the cleverest cooks in all Mnar. They suited every feaster 's taste. But the most valued of all the foods were the great fish from the [THING]. Each was very large. They were served on golden plates set with rubies and diamonds. Whilst the king and his nobles feasted inside the palace. They looked at the final dish waiting on golden plates. Others feasted in other places.\n###\nGreat honours were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings, and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of Zokkar. And the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it. At first the high-priests liked not these festivals, for there had descended amongst them queer tales of how the sea-green eikon had vanished, and how Taran-Ish had died from fear and left a warning. And they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake. But as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters. Indeed, had they not themselves, in their high tower, often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of Bokrug, the water-lizard? And a thousand years of riches and delight passed over Sarnath, wonder of the world and pride of all mankind. Gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of Ib. For a decade had it been talked of in the land of Mnar, and as it drew nigh there came to Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron, and all the cities of Mnar and the lands beyond. Before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travellers, and all the shore resounded with the song of happy revellers. Within his banquet-hall reclined Nargis-Hei, the king, drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered Pnath, and surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves. There were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast; peacocks from the isles of Nariel in the Middle Ocean, young goats from the distant hills of Implan, heels of camels from the Bnazic desert, nuts and spices from Cydathrian groves, and pearls from wave-washed Mtal dissolved in the vinegar of Thraa. Of sauces there were an untold number, prepared by the subtlest cooks in all Mnar, and suited to the palate of every feaster. But most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from the lake, each of vast size, and served up on golden platters set with rubies and diamonds. Whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace, and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters, others feasted elsewhere."}

Altogether, little could be said to have been solved; and Lake fell back on mythology for a provisional name\u2014jocosely dubbing his finds \u201cThe Elder Ones\u201d. At about 2:30 A.M., having decided to postpone further work and get a little rest, he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin, emerged from the laboratory tent, and studied the intact specimens with renewed interest. The ceaseless antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a trifle, so that the head-points and tubes of two or three shewed signs of unfolding; but Lake did not believe there was any danger of immediate decomposition in the almost sub-zero air. He did, however, move all the undissected specimens closer together and throw a spare tent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays. That would also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs, whose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem even at their substantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls which an increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their quarters. He had to weight down the corners of the tent-cloth with heavy blocks of snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale, for the titan mountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts. Early apprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived, and under Atwood\u2019s supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents, new dog-corral, and crude a\u00ebroplane shelters with snow on the mountainward side. These latter shelters, begun with hard snow blocks during odd moments, were by no means as high as they should have been; and Lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them. It was after four when Lake at last prepared to sign off and advised us all to share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter walls were a little higher. He held some friendly chat with Pabodie over the ether, and repeated his praise of the really marvellous drills that had helped him make his discovery. Atwood also sent greetings and praises. I gave Lake a warm word of congratulation, owning up that he was right about the western trip; and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning. If the gale was then over, Lake would send a plane for the party at my base."}

But this time, the pillars reached up into an airy ocean of light. It sent down one blinding beam along the path of the column I had seen. Atfer that, the scene was like a kaleidoscope. In the mix of sights, sounds. sense impressions, I felt I was to dissolve. I felt I would lose my form in some way. I will remember one flash. For a moment, I seemed to see a patch of night sky. It was filled with shining, turning spheres. As it moved, I saw the glowing suns formed a constellation. Galaxy of fixed shape. This shape was the face of Crawford Tillinghast. At another time, I felt, living things brushing past me. They walked or drifted through my body. I thought I saw Tillinghast look at them. It was as if his - trained senses could see them.

It was but had elements of consistency and permanence. It was. The part was placed over the scene. It was like a movie being shown on a painted theater curtain. I saw the laboratory. I saw the machine. I saw the form of Tillinghast across form me. But all the space not filled by known material objects was. shapes, both living and not, were mixed in disorder. to every known thing were worlsd of alien, beings. It seemed all the things were part of things. The reverse was. Among the living objects were,, - monsters. They quivered in time with the vibrations from the machine. They were in numbers. I saw to my horror that they overlapped. They were. They could pass through each and through what we know as solids. These things were. They seemed to float around with some purpose. they appeared to eat each. The attacker would throw itself at its victim. It would wipe the victim from sight.\n###\nThen I glimpsed the temple-like effect again, but this time the pillars reached up into an a\u00ebrial ocean of light, which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column I had seen before. After that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic, and in the jumble of sights, sounds, and unidentified sense-impressions I felt that I was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form. One definite flash I shall always remember. I seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining, revolving spheres, and as it receded I saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape; this shape being the distorted face of Crawford Tillinghast. At another time I felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body, and thought I saw Tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually. I recalled what he had said of the pineal gland, and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eye. Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight. Over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which, though vague, held the elements of consistency and permanence. It was indeed somewhat familiar, for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theatre. I saw the attic laboratory, the electrical machine, and the unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant. Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray, and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien, unknown entities. It likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things, and vice versa. Foremost among the living objects were great inky, jellyish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine. They were present in loathsome profusion, and I saw to my horror that they overlapped; that they were semi-fluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids. These things were never still, but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose. Sometimes they appeared to devour one another, the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight."}

I know the castle was and. It was of hallways. It had ceilings where you could see spiderwebs and shadows. The stones in the falling corridors seemed. There was a smell. It was like the smell of piled - up bodies of generations. It was. I lit candles and stared at them for comfort. There was no sun. This was because the trees grew above the tower you could reach. There was one tower that reached above the trees into the sky. But it was ruined. You could not go up it except by a climb up the wall, stone by stone. I must have lived years in this place. But I can not measure the time. Beings must have taken care of my needs. Yet I can not remember any person except myself. I can not remember anything except the rats, bats, and spiders. I think whoever took care of me must have been. My idea of a living person was something that looked like me. Made fun of me. It was, dried up, and decaying like the castle. To me, there was nothing about the bones. Skeletons scattered in some stone rooms among the foundations. I connected these things with events. I thought they were than the pictures of living beings I found in books. From books I learned all that I know. No teacher pushed or guided me. I do not remember hearing any voice in all those years. Not my voice. I had read about speech, I had thought to try to speak out. My appearance was something I thought about. There were no mirrors in the castle. I thought of myself to the figures I saw drawn. Painted in the books. I felt I was because I remembered., across the ditch. Under the, trees, I would lie. Dream for hours about what I read in the books. I would imagine myself among crowds in the world beyond the forest. Once I tried to escape from the forest. But as I went from the castle, the shade grew. The air became filled with a fear. I ran. I feared I would lose my way in a maze of night - silence.\n###\nI know not where I was born, save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible; full of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows. The stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp, and there was an accursed smell everywhere, as of the piled-up corpses of dead generations. It was never light, so that I used sometimes to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief; nor was there any sun outdoors, since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost accessible tower. There was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown outer sky, but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a well-nigh impossible climb up the sheer wall, stone by stone. I must have lived years in this place, but I cannot measure the time. Beings must have cared for my needs, yet I cannot recall any person except myself; or anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and spiders. I think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged, since my first conception of a living person was that of something mockingly like myself, yet distorted, shrivelled, and decaying like the castle. To me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons that strowed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations. I fantastically associated these things with every-day events, and thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings which I found in many of the mouldy books. From such books I learned all that I know. No teacher urged or guided me, and I do not recall hearing any human voice in all those years\u2014not even my own; for although I had read of speech, I had never thought to try to speak aloud. My aspect was a matter equally unthought of, for there were no mirrors in the castle, and I merely regarded myself by instinct as akin to the youthful figures I saw drawn and painted in the books. I felt conscious of youth because I remembered so little. Outside, across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees, I would often lie and dream for hours about what I read in the books; and would longingly picture myself amidst gay crowds in the sunny world beyond the endless forest. Once I tried to escape from the forest, but as I went farther from the castle the shade grew denser and the air more filled with brooding fear; so that I ran frantically back lest I lose my way in a labyrinth of nighted silence."}

Again he seemed to be in the interior of a house\u2014an old house, apparently\u2014but the details and inhabitants were constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects. It was queer\u2014damnably queer\u2014and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris family. And all the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought to possess itself of his vital processes. I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were by eighty-one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknown forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid; but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and that these uncomfortable visions could be, at most, no more than my uncle\u2019s reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled our minds to the exclusion of all else. Conversation, also, soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; and in time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle seemed now very wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even though the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours. Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal loneness; with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where I lay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoing yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood. My uncle\u2019s face came to me with less pleasant associations than in waking hours, and I recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out with more than natural clearness and reality."}

The - looking man who served me had a hint of the staring \" Innsmouth look \". Was in his way. He was used to the habits of strangerswho were in town. Going into Square Street, I saw that luck was with me. Shuffling out of Paine Street Street around the corner of the Gilman House, I caught sight of nothing than the,, form of Zadok Allen himself. Following my plan, I got his attention by waving my bought bottle. I realized he had begun to shuffle after me as I turned into Waite Street Street on my way to the area I could think of. I was following the map the grocery boy had drawn. I was aiming for the abandoned waterfront area I had visited. The people in sight there had been the fishermen on the breakwater. By going a blocks I could get beyond their view. I could find a pair of seats on some abandoned wharf. Be to question Zadok without being seen for as I wanted. Before I reached Main Street Street, I could hear a faint. Wheezy \" Hey, Mister! \" behind me. I let the man catch up. Take drinks from the bottle. I began asking qusetions as we walked to Water Street Street. Turned through the - ruins. leaning buildings. I found the man 's tongue did not loosen as I had expected. I saw a grass - covered opening towadr the sea between crumbling brick walls. A, earth - and - stoen wharf stuck out beyond. A group of moss - covered stones near the water promised seats. The spot was hidden from all view by a ruined warehouse on north., I thought, was the place for a talk. I led my companion dwon the lane. Picked out spots to sit among the stones. The feeling of death and abandonment was. The smell of fish was. But I was to let nothing stop me. four hours remained for conversation if I were to catch the eight o'clock coach for Arkham. I began to give out liquor to the drinker., I ate my lunch.\n###\nThe dirty-looking fellow who waited on me had a touch of the staring \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d, but was quite civil in his way; being perhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangers\u2014truckmen, gold-buyers, and the like\u2014as were occasionally in town. Re\u00ebntering the Square I saw that luck was with me; for\u2014shuffling out of Paine Street around the corner of the Gilman House\u2014I glimpsed nothing less than the tall, lean, tattered form of old Zadok Allen himself. In accordance with my plan, I attracted his attention by brandishing my newly purchased bottle; and soon realised that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as I turned into Waite Street on my way to the most deserted region I could think of. I was steering my course by the map the grocery boy had prepared, and was aiming for the wholly abandoned stretch of southern waterfront which I had previously visited. The only people in sight there had been the fishermen on the distant breakwater; and by going a few squares south I could get beyond the range of these, finding a pair of seats on some abandoned wharf and being free to question old Zadok unobserved for an indefinite time. Before I reached Main Street I could hear a faint and wheezy \u201cHey, Mister!\u201d behind me, and I presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle. I began putting out feelers as we walked along to Water Street and turned southward amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins, but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as I had expected. At length I saw a grass-grown opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls, with the weedy length of an earth-and-masonry wharf projecting beyond. Piles of moss-covered stones near the water promised tolerable seats, and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north. Here, I thought, was the ideal place for a long secret colloquy; so I guided my companion down the lane and picked out spots to sit in among the mossy stones. The air of death and desertion was ghoulish, and the smell of fish almost insufferable; but I was resolved to let nothing deter me. About four hours remained for conversation if I were to catch the eight o\u2019clock coach for Arkham, and I began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler; meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch."}

Now, as the baying of that dead, fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder, and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed web-wings circles closer and closer, I shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnamable. There was thunder in the air on the night I went to the deserted mansion atop Tempest Mountain to find the lurking fear. I was not alone, for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life. With me were two faithful and muscular men for whom I had sent when the time came; men long associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their peculiar fitness. We had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who still lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month before\u2014the nightmare creeping death. Later, I thought, they might aid me; but I did not want them then. Would to God I had let them share the search, that I might not have had to bear the secret alone so long; to bear it alone for fear the world would call me mad or go mad itself at the daemon implications of the thing. Now that I am telling it anyway, lest the brooding make me a maniac, I wish I had never concealed it. For I, and I only, know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and desolate mountain. In a small motor-car we covered the miles of primeval forest and hill until the wooded ascent checked it. The country bore an aspect more than usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the accustomed crowds of investigators, so that we were often tempted to use the acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract. It was not a wholesome landscape after dark, and I believe I would have noticed its morbidity even had I been ignorant of the terror that stalked there. Of wild creatures there were none\u2014they are wise when death leers close. The ancient lightning-scarred trees seemed unnaturally large and twisted, and the other vegetation unnaturally thick and feverish, while curious mounds and hummocks in the weedy, fulgurite-pitted earth reminded me of snakes and dead men\u2019s skulls swelled to gigantic proportions."}

Why they did this, I do not know. Many [THING] dislike the sound of a [THING] at night. Many aslo dislike cast sneaking around yards and gardens at dusk. Whatever the reason, this old couple liked to trap. Kill evrey [THING] that came near their small [THING]. From some noises heard after dark, many villagers thought the way they killed was very strange. The villagers did not talk about such things with old [THING]. This was because of the usual look on their dry, old faces. It was also because their cottage was very small. It was hidden darkly under wide oak trees at the back of an untended yard. In truth, the [THING] owners hated these odd [THING]. But they feared them even more. So they did not scold them as cruel murderers. They only made sure no beloved pet. Mouse - hunter went near the distant [THING] under the dark trees. When, by some unavoidable mistake, a [THING] was gone. Noises were heard after dark, the owner would complain helplessly. He would comfort himself by thanking Fate that it was not one of his children who had disappeared. For the [THIN]G of Ulthar were simple. They did not know where all cats originally came from. One day, a group of strange travelers from the South came into the narrow [THING] streets of Ulthar. They were Dark travelers. They were not like the other roaming [THING] who cmae through the [THING] twice each year. In the market square, they told fortunes for money. They also bought bright beads from the sellers. No one could tell what ladn these travelers came from. But [THING] saw that they performed strange prayers. They had also painted strange pictures on the sides of their wagons. The pictures showed shapes with human bodies. The heads of cats, hawks, rams. The leader of the group wore a headpiece with two horns. There was a curious disc between the horns. In this unusual group, there was a little boy. He had no father and no mother. He only had a tiny black kitten to love. Sikcness had not been good to him. But it had left him this small furry thing to ease his sadness. When one is very young, one can find much comfort in the playful actions of a black kitten.\n###\nIn Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbours. Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight. But whatever the reason, this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel; and from some of the sounds heard after dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar. But the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard. In truth, much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of berating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees. When through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard after dark, the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by thanking Fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished. For the people of Ulthar were simple, and knew not whence it is all cats first came. One day a caravan of strange wanderers from the South entered the narrow cobbled streets of Ulthar. Dark wanderers they were, and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year. In the market-place they told fortunes for silver, and bought gay beads from the merchants. What was the land of these wanderers none could tell; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats, hawks, rams, and lions. And the leader of the caravan wore a head-dress with two horns and a curious disc betwixt the horns. There was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother, but only a tiny black kitten to cherish. The plague had not been kind to him, yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow; and when one is very young, one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten."}

Around noon I found a.\n###\nThe task seemed interminable, and I raged almost as violently as the hermit when I saw the hours slipping by in a breathless, foodless round of vain telephoning, and a hectic quest from place to place, hither and thither by subway and surface car. About noon I encountered a suitable supply house far downtown, and at approximately 1:30 p.m. arrived at my boarding-place with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent mechanics. I had done all I could, and hoped I was in time. Black terror, however, had preceded me. The house was in utter turmoil, and above the chatter of awed voices I heard a man praying in a deep basso. Fiendish things were in the air, and lodgers told over the beads of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the doctor\u2019s closed door. The lounger I had hired, it seems, had fled screaming and mad-eyed not long after his second delivery of ice; perhaps as a result of excessive curiosity. He could not, of course, have locked the door behind him; yet it was now fastened, presumably from the inside. There was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow, thick dripping. Briefly consulting with Mrs. Herrero and the workmen despite a fear that gnawed my inmost soul, I advised the breaking down of the door; but the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some wire device. We had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms on that hall, and flung all the windows to the very top. Now, noses protected by handkerchiefs, we tremblingly invaded the accursed south room which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoon. A kind of dark, slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall door, and thence to the desk, where a terrible little pool had accumulated. Something was scrawled there in pencil in an awful, blind hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws that traced the hurried last words. Then the trail led to the couch and ended unutterably. What was, or had been, on the couch I cannot and dare not say here. But this is what I shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before I drew a match and burned it to a crisp; what I puzzled out in terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police station."}

But, I started a study of cases. I wanted to see how. Uncommon visions might be among memory loss victims. My results were helped by psychologists, historians, anthropologists, and experts wiht experience. They were helped by a study thta included all records of personalities. These ranged from the days of demon - possession stories to the present. At, the results bothered me than they comforted me. I found that my dreams had no match in the majority of memory loss cases., a number of accounts remained. For years, these shocked me with how they were to my experience. Some were bits of folklore. Others were case histories in records. One or two were stories hidden in histories. It seemed that. My kind of trouble was, examples of it had happened at intervals since the start of records. Some centuries might have one, two, or three cases. Others had none, or at none whose record survived. The core was the. A person is taken over by a life. For a or period, tehy live a existence. At, this shows as speech and movement., there is a gaiinng of,,, and knowledge. This gaining is done with excitement and a ability to absorb. the consciousness returns. After that, it is troubled by, dreams. These suggest pieces of some memory erased. The likeness of those nightmares to my, in some details, left no doubt in my mind. They were in a way. One or two of the cases had an feeling of, familiarity. It was as if I had heard of them before through some channel. to think about. In three cases, there was mention of an machine like the one in my house before the change. Another thing that worried me during my research was the number of cases. In these, a, - to - catch look at the nightmares was given to people without memory loss.\n###\nThere were the dreams\u2014and these seemed to grow in vividness and concreteness. Knowing how most would regard them, I seldom mentioned them to anyone but my son or certain trusted psychologists, but eventually I commenced a scientific study of other cases in order to see how typical or non-typical such visions might be among amnesia victims. My results, aided by psychologists, historians, anthropologists, and mental specialists of wide experience, and by a study that included all records of split personalities from the days of daemoniac-possession legends to the medically realistic present, at first bothered me more than they consoled me. I soon found that my dreams had indeed no counterpart in the overwhelming bulk of true amnesia cases. There remained, however, a tiny residue of accounts which for years baffled and shocked me with their parallelism to my own experience. Some of them were bits of ancient folklore; others were case-histories in the annals of medicine; one or two were anecdotes obscurely buried in standard histories. It thus appeared that, while my special kind of affliction was prodigiously rare, instances of it had occurred at long intervals ever since the beginning of man\u2019s annals. Some centuries might contain one, two, or three cases; others none\u2014or at least none whose record survived. The essence was always the same\u2014a person of keen thoughtfulness seized with a strange secondary life and leading for a greater or lesser period an utterly alien existence typified at first by vocal and bodily awkwardness, and later by a wholesale acquisition of scientific, historic, artistic, and anthropological knowledge; an acquisition carried on with feverish zest and with a wholly abnormal absorptive power. Then a sudden return of the rightful consciousness, intermittently plagued ever after with vague unplaceable dreams suggesting fragments of some hideous memory elaborately blotted out. And the close resemblance of those nightmares to my own\u2014even in some of the smallest particulars\u2014left no doubt in my mind of their significantly typical nature. One or two of the cases had an added ring of faint, blasphemous familiarity, as if I had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too morbid and frightful to contemplate. In three instances there was specific mention of such an unknown machine as had been in my house before the second change. Another thing that cloudily worried me during my investigation was the somewhat greater frequency of cases where a brief, elusive glimpse of the typical nightmares was afforded to persons not visited with well-defined amnesia."}

One steady stock-boy\u2014a produce manager under cover\u2014came to converse with him quite regularly, and from the tone of his discourse ventured the opinion that he had been a gourmand or epicure in his day.

This he would sometimes draw from his tattered reusable bag, carefully unwrap from its covering of waxed paper, and gaze upon for hours with an expression of ineffable longing and tenderness. It was not the advertisement of one which a common patron would be likely to procure, but of a cut of exquisite breeding and quality, garbed in the quaint packaging of thirty years before. The Old Shopper himself seemed also to belong to the past, for his nondescript cart bore every hallmark of antiquity. He was a man of immense deliberation, probably more than six aisles per hour, though his stooping scrutiny sometimes belied this fact. His list, a dirty white and falling apart in patches, was never organized; and over his lean selections grew a mangy assortment of impulse buys which seemed always to remain at the superfluous stage\u2014never essential\u2014yet never numerous enough to form a respectable haul. His purchases had perhaps been noble once, but were now seamed with the ghastly effects of terrible expiration. At one time\u2014probably in the morning\u2014he had evidently been grossly provisioned; but now he was horribly selective, the purple coupons hanging in loose pouches under his bleary eyes and upon his reusable sacks.

I figured it out in fear. Two workers ran wildly from that terrible place. They went to tell their confused stories at the nearest police station. The sickening words seemed almoost impossible to believe in the yellow sunlight. Cars and trucks were making loud noises from the busy street below. Yet I admit I believed them at that time.

The nauseous words seemed well-nigh incredible in that yellow sunlight, with the clatter of cars and motor trucks ascending clamorously from crowded Fourteenth Street, yet I confess that I believed them then.

He felt the wood's splintered surface grabbing his look. He was pulled from his daydream into an empty stare. For a moment he heard a dry, papery sound. He saw the messy shapelessness of the old layers moving before him. But that moment was very short. Soon he was in rough, worn little area. It had rough posts and rails going to an end just past his sight. It had a strangely wavy ground under its baes. Revealed stood out clearly on that surface. There were wide areas full of flakes of every age and decay. In the center were a knot and a crack. Both seemed fixed in place. Minute pieces of unknown shape and start were placed on the edges of the areas. In the bright morning light the watcher thought he saw a match of the blistered pattern. It had confused him very deeply before. On the left the surface dropped suddenly. It left a pale triangle hole. After a second of dry whispering a hateful little curled thing came out. It had grey color and a fibrous wood center.\n###\nIn the pallid morning light of day the ancient fence and the flaking, fragmented paint came again and with a greater distinctness than on any former observation. This time they actually confronted him, and he felt the wood\u2019s splintered surface clutching at his gaze. He was drawn out of his reverie and into a vacant scrutiny, and for a moment he heard a dry, papery rustling and saw the chaotic amorphousness of the weathered layers seething before him. But that moment was very brief, for presently he was in a crude, weathered little expanse with rough posts and rails extending to a terminus just beyond his vision, and with a curious undulating ground beneath its base. Revealed starkly on that surface were broad patches full of flakes of every degree of antiquity and disintegration, and in the centre were a knot and a crack, both apparently anchored in place. Minute fragments of unknown shape and origin were arrayed on the edges of the patches, and in the glaring morning light the observer thought he saw a counterpart of the blistered pattern which had perplexed him so profoundly.

The space between showed - looking buildings at a below - ice level. The opening itself would be in the basement. It would be on the corner nearest the foothills. It was part of a five - pointed building and for ceremonies. We tried to identify it from our air study of the ruins. No building came to mind as we recalled our flight. We decided its parts were damaged. It was broken in an ice crack we had seen. In the case, the tunnel would be blocked. we would have to try the one. That one was than a mile to the north. The river in between stopped us from trying any of the tunnels on this trip., if both ones were blocked, it was if our batteries would allow an attempt on the one. That one was a mile beyond our choice.\n###\nWe had done so much of our studying and copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly continuous use; and despite the special dry cell formula would obviously be good for only about four more\u2014though by keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or difficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that. It would not do to be without a light in these Cyclopean catacombs, hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further mural deciphering. Of course we intended to revisit the place for days and perhaps weeks of intensive study and photography\u2014curiosity having long ago got the better of horror\u2014but just now we must hasten. Our supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were reluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment it; but we did let one large notebook go. If worst came to worst, we could resort to rock-chipping\u2014and of course it would be possible, even in case of really lost direction, to work up to full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial and error. So at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnel. According to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired tunnel-mouth could not be much more than a quarter-mile from where we stood; the intervening space shewing solid-looking buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a sub-glacial level. The opening itself would be in the basement\u2014on the angle nearest the foothills\u2014of a vast five-pointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial nature, which we tried to identify from our a\u00ebrial survey of the ruins. No such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we concluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had been totally shattered in an ice-rift we had noticed. In the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one\u2014the one less than a mile to the north. The intervening river-course prevented our trying any of the more southerly tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighbouring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one\u2014about a mile beyond our second choice."}

The mummies could not have been for anyoone else in town. Curwen seemed aware of what people thought. He spoke casually severla times about the chemical value of mummy balms.

His exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge, and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous labours."}

Though there were blocks than where we started, I felt there must be a amount beneath the surface.\n###\nMost of these were carven megaliths with curved tops and bottoms. A minority were smaller, flatter, plain-surfaced, and square or octagonally cut\u2014like those of the floors and pavements in my dreams\u2014while a few were singularly massive and curved or slanted in such a manner as to suggest use in vaulting or groining, or as parts of arches or round window casings. The deeper\u2014and the farther north and east\u2014we dug, the more blocks we found; though we still failed to discover any trace of arrangement among them. Professor Dyer was appalled at the measureless age of the fragments, and Freeborn found traces of symbols which fitted darkly into certain Papuan and Polynesian legends of infinite antiquity. The condition and scattering of the blocks told mutely of vertiginous cycles of time and geologic upheavals of cosmic savagery. We had an a\u00ebroplane with us, and my son Wingate would often go up to different heights and scan the sand-and-rock waste for signs of dim, large-scale outlines\u2014either differences of level or trails of scattered blocks. His results were virtually negative; for whenever he would one day think he had glimpsed some significant trend, he would on his next trip find the impression replaced by another equally insubstantial\u2014a result of the shifting, wind-blown sand. One or two of these ephemeral suggestions, though, affected me queerly and disagreeably. They seemed, after a fashion, to dovetail horribly with something which I had dreamed or read, but which I could no longer remember. There was a terrible pseudo-familiarity about them\u2014which somehow made me look furtively and apprehensively over the abominable, sterile terrain toward the north and northeast. Around the first week in July I developed an unaccountable set of mixed emotions about that general northeasterly region. There was horror, and there was curiosity\u2014but more than that, there was a persistent and perplexing illusion of memory. I tried all sorts of psychological expedients to get these notions out of my head, but met with no success. Sleeplessness also gained upon me, but I almost welcomed this because of the resultant shortening of my dream-periods. I acquired the habit of taking long, lone walks in the desert late at night\u2014usually to the north or northeast, whither the sum of my strange new impulses seemed subtly to pull me. Sometimes, on these walks, I would stumble over nearly buried fragments of the ancient masonry. Though there were fewer visible blocks here than where we had started, I felt sure that there must be a vast abundance beneath the surface."}

He sent the call of the cat across the fields lit by stars. A large, serious cat in a nearby house picked up the call. It passed message over miles of rolling grassland to fighters big and small. These cats were black, gray, striped, white, yellow, and mixed colors. The call echoed through Nir and past the Ska,i even into Ulthar. The mayn cats of Ulthar answered together and formed a line to march. It was lucky the moon was not up, so all cats were on the ground. Swiftly and jumping without sound, they leaped from every fireplace and roof. They flowed like a great furry ocean across the flat lands to the edge of the woods. Caretr was there to welcome them. The siight of well-formed, healthy cats was truly good for his eyes after the things he had seen. Walked with in the deep pit. He was happy to see his respected friend and former savior leading Ulthar's group. A collar shownig rank was around his smooth neck. His whiskers stood stiffly at a military angle. Better still, a juniro officer in that army wass an active young cat. This cat turned out to be exactly the very small kitten at the in.n Carter had given thaat kitten a dish of rich cream on that morning logn ago in Ulthar. He was now a strong and promising CAT. He made a purring sound as he shook hands with his friend. His grandfather said he was doing very well in the army. He said the young cat coudl likely expect to become a captain after one more battle.\n###\nVery quietly therefore did Randolph Carter steal to the edge of the wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields. And a great grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small, black, grey, tiger, white, yellow, and mixed; and it echoed through Nir and beyond the Skai even into Ulthar, and Ulthar\u2019s numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march. It was fortunate that the moon was not up, so that all the cats were on earth. Swiftly and silently leaping, they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge of the wood. Carter was there to greet them, and the sight of shapely, wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss. He was glad to see his venerable friend and one-time rescuer at the head of Ulthar\u2019s detachment, a collar of rank around his sleek neck, and whiskers bristling at a martial angle. Better still, as a sub-lieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom Carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that long-vanished morning in Ulthar. He was a strapping and promising cat now, and purred as he shook hands with his friend. His grandfather said he was doing very well in the army, and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more campaign."}

But while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men, and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world. There were tales of the queer claw-prints seen around farmhouse windows in the morning, and of occasional disappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas. Tales, besides, of buzzing voices in imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travellers on roads and cart-paths in the deep woods, and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their dooryards. In the final layer of legends\u2014the layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close contact with the dreaded places\u2014there are shocked references to hermits and remote farmers who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change, and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings. In one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred things. As to what the things were\u2014explanations naturally varied. The common name applied to them was \u201cthose ones\u201d, or \u201cthe old ones\u201d, though other terms had a local and transient use. Perhaps the bulk of the Puritan settlers set them down bluntly as familiars of the devil, and made them a basis of awed theological speculation. Those with Celtic legendry in their heritage\u2014mainly the Scotch-Irish element of New Hampshire, and their kindred who had settled in Vermont on Governor Wentworth\u2019s colonial grants\u2014linked them vaguely with the malign fairies and \u201clittle people\u201d of the bogs and raths, and protected themselves with scraps of incantation handed down through many generations. But the Indians had the most fantastic theories of all. While different tribal legends differed, there was a marked consensus of belief in certain vital particulars; it being unanimously agreed that the creatures were not native to this earth. The Pennacook myths, which were the most consistent and picturesque, taught that the Winged Ones came from the Great Bear in the sky, and had mines in our earthly hills whence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any other world."}

He made people with his stories about chemical research. stories began to spread. They were about lights burning all night., the lights stopped burning. stories started. They were meat orders from the butcher. There were stories of muffled shouting, speaking, chanting, and screaming. These sounds seemed to come from a cellar under the place., the and household was disliked by the people. It is not that hints were made. These hints connected the hated place with the outbreak of vamipre - attacks and murders. This was since the arae of that plague seemed to Pawtuxet. The streets of Edgewood. Ward spent of his time at the bungalow. He slept at home. He was considered a resident in his father 's house. he was from the city on trips lasting a week. The destinations of these trips are. He grew and than. He seemed when repeating his story to Dr. Willett. His story was about research and discoveries. Willett waited for him at his father 's house. The Ward was and. He wanted his son to have supervision as. This was because his son was and. The doctor insists the man was at this time. He mentions conversations to prove his point. About September the vampirism decreased. But in the following January Ward he was involved in trouble. For some time, people had talked about trucks arriving. Leaving at night at the Pawtuxet bungalow. At this point, an problem revealed the nature of one item they carried. In a spot near Hope Valley, one of the robberies of trucks happened. \" Hi - jackers \" were looking for liquor shipments. This time, the robbers were destined to get the shock. The cases they took proved to contain things when opened. that the matter could not be kept among the underworld. The thieves buried what they found. But when the State Police heard about it, a search was conducted.\n###\nWard himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research. Before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butcher\u2019s and of the muffled shouting, declamation, rhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of Edgewood. Ward spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his father\u2019s roof. Twice he was absent from the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have not yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to Dr. Willett his old, old story of vital research and future revelations. Willett often waylaid him at his father\u2019s house, for the elder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his point. About September the vampirism declined, but in the following January Ward almost became involved in serious trouble. For some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents. In a lonely spot near Hope Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylayings of trucks by \u201chi-jackers\u201d in quest of liquor shipments, but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock. For the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State Police got wind of the matter a careful search was made."}

When he went to bed, he had an - of dream. He dreamed of cities made of blocks and sky - stones. All were with slime and of hidden horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars. From some place came a voice that was not a voice. It was a feeling. imagination could turn it into sound. He tried to write it as the mix of letters: \" Cthulhu fhtagn \". This - up word was the key to the memory that excited and Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with detail. He studied the carving with intensity. The man found himself working on it when he woke up. He was and in his night clothes. Waking had come over him. My uncle blamed his age, Wilcox said, for being to know both the picture - writings. The picture design. of his questions seemed out of place to his visitor. those trying to connect him with cults or groups. Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence he was offered. In exchange, he had to admit he belonged to some. group. When Professor Angell became the sculptor knew nothing of any cult or knowledge system. He pressed his visitor for reports of dreams. This gave results. After the meeting, the writing recrods visits from the man. He told shocking pieces of night images. Their theme was some view of, stone. An voice or mind shouted. It gave puzzling sense - impacts that could be written as nonsense. The two sounds repeated are written as the letters \" Cthulhu \" and \" R\u2019lyeh \". On March 23rd, the writing continued, Wilcox did not appear. Asking at his rooms showed he had been hit with an kind of fever. He was taken to his family 's home in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, waking artists in the building. Since, he switched between being and being. My uncle called the family at. From, he watched the case. He visited the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey. He learned the doctor was in charge.\n###\nThere had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox\u2019s imagination had been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror. Hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars, and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound, but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters, \u201cCthulhu fhtagn\u201d. This verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only in his night-clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters \u201cCthulhu\u201d and \u201cR\u2019lyeh\u201d. On March 23d, the manuscript continued, Wilcox failed to appear; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in Waterman Street. He had cried out in the night, arousing several other artists in the building, and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium. My uncle at once telephoned the family, and from that time forward kept close watch of the case; calling often at the Thayer Street office of Dr. Tobey, whom he learned to be in charge."}

Its poor condition would make this process very Time and the Congo climate do not preserve mummies well. This is especially true when their preservation is as unprofessional as it seemed here. Around Around the creature's neck was a golden chain. It held an locket with coat of arms designs. This was no doubt some unulcky traveler's keepsake. The N\u2019bangus took it and hung it on the goddess as a charm. Commenting on mummy's face shape, M. Verhaeren made a playful comparison. Or rather, he humorously wondered how it would affect his correspondent. But he was too scientifically interested to waste words on jokes. He wrote that the preserved goddess would arrive properly packed about a month after getting the letter. The boxed object was delivered at Jermyn House on the afternoon of August 3, 1913. It was taken right to the room. This room held the collection of African specimens arranged by Sir Robert and Arthur. What happened next is known best from servants' stories. Papers checked later. Of the different stories, Soames the family butler's is the fullest and clearest. According According to this reliable man, Sir Arthur Jermyn sent everyone out of the room before opening the box. But the immediate sound of hmamer and cihsel showed he did not wait. Sounds Nothing were heard for some time. Soames cannot say exactly how But certainly less than fifteen minutes later, a scream was heard. It was undoubtedly Jermyn's voice. Soon Immediately afterward Jermyn came out of the room. He rushed wildly toward the front of the house as if chased by a enemy. The look on his face was indescribable. His face was already very pale when calm. Near the front door he seemed to think of something. He turned back in his escape. He finally went down the stairs to the cellar and disappeared. The servants were completely shocked. They watcehd at the top of the stairs. Their master did not come back. A smell of oil was all that came from below. After a rattling came from the door connecting the cellar to the yard. A stable-boy saw Arthur Jremyn. He was shining from head to foot with oil and smelled strongly of it. He sneaked out secretly and disappeared onto the black moor around the house.\n###\nWhether it was human or simian only a scientist could determine, and the process of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition. Time and the Congo climate are not kind to mummies; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here. Around the creature\u2019s neck had been found a golden chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs; no doubt some hapless traveller\u2019s keepsake, taken by the N\u2019bangus and hung upon the goddess as a charm. In commenting on the contour of the mummy\u2019s face, M. Verhaeren suggested a whimsical comparison; or rather, expressed a humorous wonder just how it would strike his correspondent, but was too much interested scientifically to waste many words in levity. The stuffed goddess, he wrote, would arrive duly packed about a month after receipt of the letter. The boxed object was delivered at Jermyn House on the afternoon of August 3, 1913, being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which housed the collection of African specimens as arranged by Sir Robert and Arthur. What ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and papers later examined. Of the various tales that of aged Soames, the family butler, is most ample and coherent. According to this trustworthy man, Sir Arthur Jermyn dismissed everyone from the room before opening the box, though the instant sound of hammer and chisel shewed that he did not delay the operation. Nothing was heard for some time; just how long Soames cannot exactly estimate; but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the horrible scream, undoubtedly in Jermyn\u2019s voice, was heard. Immediately afterward Jermyn emerged from the room, rushing frantically toward the front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy. The expression on his face, a face ghastly enough in repose, was beyond description. When near the front door he seemed to think of something, and turned back in his flight, finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar. The servants were utterly dumbfounded, and watched at the head of the stairs, but their master did not return. A smell of oil was all that came up from the regions below. After dark a rattling was heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard; and a stable-boy saw Arthur Jermyn, glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of that fluid, steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor surrounding the house."}

Several people saw this bowl, though no one was ever allowed to watch the closely wacthed internal steps. He wrapped this bowl in a strange, paper-like cover.

He believed he could find and get the preserved goddess. He had heard stories about it. The N\u2019bangus were servants of King Albert \u2019s government. With a persuasion, they could be made to give up the god they had taken., When Jermyn sailed for England with hope. He expected that within months he would get a relic. This would confirm the story from his - - - grandfather. That, the story he had heard. Countrymen near Jermyn Dwelling had heard wilder tales. Thees were passed down from ancestors who listened to Sir Wade at the tables of the Knight \u2019s Head. Arthur Jermyn waited for the expected box from M. Verhaeren., he studied his ancestor 's manuscripts with care. He began to feel to Sir Wade. He looked for relics of the latter 's life in England. He looked for relics of his adventures. There had been accounts of the and wife. But no relic of her stay at Jermyn House remained. Jermyn wondered what situation caused or allowed removal. He decided the husband 's madness was the reason. He recalled that his - - - grandmother was said to be the daughter of a trader in Africa. her background. knowledge of the Dark Continent made her Sir Wade 's talk about the interior. Such a man would not forgive that. She died in Africa, taken by a husband to prove what he said. But as Jermyn thought about this, he had to smile at its pointlessness. It was a century and a half after both his ancestors died., In June, 1913, a letter came from M. Verhaeren. It told of finding the preserved goddess. The Belgian stated it was a object. It was an object a - expert could not classify. a scientist could tell if it was or ape -. Its condition would make this process. Time and the Congo climate do not preserve mummies. This is when their preservation is as it seemed.\n###\nM. Verhaeren, Belgian agent at a trading-post on the Congo, believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess, of which he had vaguely heard; since the once mighty N\u2019bangus were now the submissive servants of King Albert\u2019s government, and with but little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had carried off. When Jermyn sailed for England, therefore, it was with the exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his great-great-great-grandfather\u2019s narratives\u2014that is, the wildest which he had ever heard. Countrymen near Jermyn House had perhaps heard wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to Sir Wade around the tables of the Knight\u2019s Head. Arthur Jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from M. Verhaeren, meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts left by his mad ancestor. He began to feel closely akin to Sir Wade, and to seek relics of the latter\u2019s personal life in England as well as of his African exploits. Oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded wife had been numerous, but no tangible relic of her stay at Jermyn House remained. Jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or permitted such an effacement, and decided that the husband\u2019s insanity was the prime cause. His great-great-great-grandmother, he recalled, was said to have been the daughter of a Portuguese trader in Africa. No doubt her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the Dark Continent had caused her to flout Sir Wade\u2019s talk of the interior, a thing which such a man would not be likely to forgive. She had died in Africa, perhaps dragged thither by a husband determined to prove what he had told. But as Jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not but smile at their futility, a century and a half after the death of both of his strange progenitors. In June, 1913, a letter arrived from M. Verhaeren, telling of the finding of the stuffed goddess. It was, the Belgian averred, a most extraordinary object; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify. Whether it was human or simian only a scientist could determine, and the process of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition. Time and the Congo climate are not kind to mummies; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here."}

Fishing boats rest at their docks. A story circulated about objects floating down the river. They became for a moment as they went over the falls., the Pawtuxet is a river. It winds through areas with graveyards., the spring rains had been. The fishermen near the bridge did not like look one of the things had as it fell to the water. Thye did not like how another one seemed to half cry out, though its state was from things that make sound. That rumor made Smith hurry to the riverbank behind the farm. Weeden was at sea at that time. Sure, signs of a collapse remained., there was no sign of an entrance into the bank. The landslide had left a wall of earth and plants from. Smith tried some digging. But he was stopped by a lack of success. Or he was stopped by fear of what success might mean. It is to think about what the. Vengeful Weeden would have done if he had been on land. By the autumn of 1770, Weeden decided the time was to tell others about his discoveries. He had facts to connect. He had eyewitness to reject any claim that jealousy. Spite had fueled his imagination. He chose Capt as his trusted person. James Mathewson of the Enterprise knew him not to doubt his truthfulness. On the hand, he was in the town for people to listen to him with respect. The conversation happened in an room of Sabin 's Tavern near the docks. Smith was to confirm every statement. It was that Capt. Mathewson was affected. Like everyone in the town, he had his suspicions about Joseph Curwen., this confirmation and information were to convince him.\n###\nSomething was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out. That rumour sent Smith\u2014for Weeden was just then at sea\u2014in haste to the river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success\u2014or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time. By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabin\u2019s Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed.

Unseen oxidation processes push into and fill the ordinary world at every point. The hose, when and first used, withstood both city water and collected rainwater. Nowhere, however, could not escape wear. As it aged, the tarnish and flaws of its materila became increasingly frustrating to se.e In the summer months, it endured rough handling. At all times, it unavoidably absorbed any moisture. Mineral deposit that seemed likely to speed its metal decay. Substances, like iron oxide's hidden takeover of its woven cover, it accepted with certainty. A dozen unknown alloys in its connector fascinated chemists with their slow breakdown. It would lie coiled for ages in the corner of a gadren shed. It once survived a very harsh winter, gaining a scary, crystal-like brittleness no gardener had seen before. A tempting idea grew within its material: a fatal weak spot must exist somewhere. If found, it would let natural forces reach the inner coils. The core strength of those coils was very fragile. The weakness might be on the outside you can see. Or it might only be in the cracks of its inner self. Maybe its own partly-rusted structure held that hidden flaw. That flaw would cause complete failure and breakdown in forgotten yard corners. It would join the earth and the endless process of decay.\n###\nFilled with a feeling that our domestic implements are but transient vessels in a cosmos of decay and corrosion, and that unseen processes of oxidation press on and permeate the sphere of the mundane at every juncture, the hose in its prime and early service endured in turn the torrents of municipal water and collected rainwater. Nowhere, however, could it find respite from attrition; and as it grew older the patina and limitations of its material became more and more maddening to behold. During the sun-scorched seasons it endured the ministrations of careless hands, and at all times it absorbed inexorably any moisture or mineral deposit which seemed to promise a hastening of its metallic dissolution. Substances like ferrous oxide\u2019s insidious conquest of its braided shell it accepted with grim inevitability, and a dozen obscure alloys within its coupling enthralled chemists with their slow degradation. It would lie coiled for epochs in the shadowed recesses of a garden shed, and once endured a winter of terrible frosts to acquire a crystalline brittleness of dreadful aspect, which no gardener had ever before witnessed. There rose within its very fabric the tantalising certainty that somewhere a fatal weakness existed, which if discovered would admit the elemental forces freely to those inner coils whose integrity remained so tenuously at the core of its being. It might be in the visible exterior, yet it might be only in the microscopic fractures of its soul. Perhaps it held within its own half-corroded structure that cryptic flaw which would awaken it to total failure and dissolution in forgotten corners of the yard; which would bind it to the earth, and to the damp eternities of decomposition beyond."}

And it was there that fulfilment came, and he met the cortege of knights come from Celepha\u00efs to bear him thither forever. Handsome knights they were, astride roan horses and clad in shining armour with tabards of cloth-of-gold curiously emblazoned. So numerous were they, that Kuranes almost mistook them for an army, but their leader told him they were sent in his honour; since it was he who had created Ooth-Nargai in his dreams, on which account he was now to be appointed its chief god for evermore. Then they gave Kuranes a horse and placed him at the head of the cavalcade, and all rode majestically through the downs of Surrey and onward toward the region where Kuranes and his ancestors were born. It was very strange, but as the riders went on they seemed to gallop back through Time; for whenever they passed through a village in the twilight they saw only such houses and villages as Chaucer or men before him might have seen, and sometimes they saw knights on horseback with small companies of retainers. When it grew dark they travelled more swiftly, till soon they were flying uncannily as if in the air. In the dim dawn they came upon the village which Kuranes had seen alive in his childhood, and asleep or dead in his dreams. It was alive now, and early villagers courtesied as the horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that ends in the abyss of dream. Kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night, and wondered what it would look like by day; so he watched anxiously as the column approached its brink. Just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the east and hid all the landscape in its effulgent draperies. The abyss was now a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour, and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations. Endlessly down the horsemen floated, their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness, the brightness of the city Celepha\u00efs, and the sea-coast beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky."}

A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst, but his observation has not been verified. All of the few observers, however, agree as to the violent gust from the west and the flood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke; whilst evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after the stroke is equally general.

When they saw the same face in the same position that evening, they felt worried, and watched for the lights to come up in his apartment. Later they rang the bell of the darkened flat, and finally had a policeman force the door. The rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window, and when the intruders saw the glassy, bulging eyes, and the marks of stark, convulsive fright on the twisted features, they turned away in sickened dismay. Shortly afterward the coroner\u2019s physician made an examination, and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock, or nervous tension induced by electrical discharge, as the cause of death. The hideous expression he ignored altogether, deeming it a not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions. He deduced these latter qualities from the books, paintings, and manuscripts found in the apartment, and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the desk. Blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last, and the broken-pointed pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically contracted right hand. The entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed, and legible only in part. From them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official verdict, but such speculations have little chance for belief among the conservative. The case of these imaginative theorists has not been helped by the action of superstitious Dr. Dexter, who threw the curious box and angled stone\u2014an object certainly self-luminous as seen in the black windowless steeple where it was found\u2014into the deepest channel of Narragansett Bay."}

Arranging with the Belgian authorities for a party of guides, he spent a year in the Onga and Kaliri country, finding data beyond the highest of his expectations. Among the Kaliris was an aged chief called Mwanu, who possessed not only a highly retentive memory, but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends. This ancient confirmed every tale which Jermyn had heard, adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him."}

Twice I saw people who looked tired working in gardens. Digging clams on the fishy-smelling beach below. Groups of dirty children with faces like monkeys played near doorsteps covered in weeds. These people seemed moer troubling than the sad buildings. Almost every one had faces. Ways of moving that I did not like, though I could not say why. For a moment, I thought their common look reminded me of a picture I had seen, maybe in a book, under very scary. But this false memory went away quickly. As the bus went lower, I started to hear the constant sound of a waterfall through the unusual The leaning, unpainted houses became more numerous. They lined both sides of the road. Looked more like a town than the ones we left behind. The view ahead narrowed to a street scene. In some places, I could see where a stone road. Brick sidewalk had once been. All the houses seemed There were occasional spaces where fallen chimneys and cellar walls showed buildings had collapsed. There was the worst fishy smell you could imagine. Side streets and crossings began to appear. Those on the left led to dirty, unpaved areas near the shore that were falling apart. Those on the right showed views of past greatness. Far, I had seen no people in the town. Now there were signs of a few living therewood. Brick buildings from the early 1800s\u2014they were clearly kept in condition for living. As someone who likes things, I almost forgot the smell. My feelings of threat. Disgust among this well-preserved piece of the past. But I was not to reach my goal without one very strong and unpleasant impression. The bus arrived at a kind of open square. Central point with churches on two sides. The messy remains of a round green area in the middle. I was looking at a hall with pillars at the crossing ahead on the right. The building's once-white paint was now gray and coming off. Gold sign on the front was. Faded I could barely read the words \"Esotreic Order of Dagon\".\n###\nOnce or twice I saw listless-looking people working in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishy-smelling beach below, and groups of dirty, simian-visaged children playing around weed-grown doorsteps. Somehow these people seemed more disquieting than the dismal buildings, for almost every one had certain peculiarities of face and motions which I instinctively disliked without being able to define or comprehend them. For a second I thought this typical physique suggested some picture I had seen, perhaps in a book, under circumstances of particular horror or melancholy; but this pseudo-recollection passed very quickly. As the bus reached a lower level I began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness. The leaning, unpainted houses grew thicker, lined both sides of the road, and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind. The panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene, and in spots I could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed. All the houses were apparently deserted, and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed. Pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odour imaginable. Soon cross streets and junctions began to appear; those on the left leading to shoreward realms of unpaved squalor and decay, while those on the right shewed vistas of departed grandeur. So far I had seen no people in the town, but there now came signs of a sparse habitation\u2014curtained windows here and there, and an occasional battered motor-car at the curb. Pavement and sidewalks were increasingly well defined, and though most of the houses were quite old\u2014wood and brick structures of the early nineteenth century\u2014they were obviously kept fit for habitation. As an amateur antiquarian I almost lost my olfactory disgust and my feeling of menace and repulsion amidst this rich, unaltered survival from the past. But I was not to reach my destination without one very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality. The bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the centre, and I was looking at a large pillared hall on the right-hand junction ahead. The structure\u2019s once white paint was now grey and peeling, and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that I could only with difficulty make out the words \u201cEsoteric Order of Dagon\u201d."}

Tiredness, because I had not slept for many days. My goal was strong, because I loved my home country of Lomar. The marble city of Olatho\u00eb that sits between the peaks of Noton. As I stood in the highest room of the tower, I saw the horned shrinking moon, re.d Evil, shaking through the mists that hung over the far valley of Banof. Through a hole in the roof shone the pale Pole Star, moving as if alive. Looking like a devil. Methought its spirit whispered advice, calming me into traitorous sleepiness with a rhythmic promise which it said again. Again: Vainly I fougth against my sleepiness, trying to link these words with some sky knowledge I had learned from the Pnakotic writings. My head, heavy. Spinning, fell to my chest. When I next looked up it was in a dream. With the Pole Star smiling at me through a window from beyond the moving trees of a draem swamp. And I am still dreaming. In my shame. Hopelessness I sometimes scream wildly, begging the dream beings around me to wake me before the Inutos move up the path behind the peak Noton. Capture the fortress by surprise. These beings are demons, because they laugh at me. Say I am not dreaming. They make fun of me. The yellow enemy may be moving quietly toward us. I have failed in my duty and betrayed marble city of Olatho\u00eb. I have been false to Alos, my friend and leader. But still these shadows of my dream mock me. They say there is no land of Lomar, except in my night imaginations. They say that in those places where the Pole Star shines Red Aldebaran moves around the hoirzon, there has been nothing. Snow for thousands of years. They say there has never been a man there except yellow creatures, harmed by the whom they call \"Esquimaux\". I have often wondered if most people ever stop to think about the sometimes huge importance of dreams. Of the hidden world to which they belong.\n###\nMy brain was sore dazed with excitement and fatigue, for I had not slept in many days; yet was my purpose firm, for I loved my native land of Lomar, and the marble city of Olatho\u00eb that lies betwixt the peaks of Noton and Kadiphonek. But as I stood in the tower\u2019s topmost chamber, I beheld the horned waning moon, red and sinister, quivering through the vapours that hovered over the distant valley of Banof. And through an opening in the roof glittered the pale Pole Star, fluttering as if alive, and leering like a fiend and tempter. Methought its spirit whispered evil counsel, soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over: Vainly did I struggle with my drowsiness, seeking to connect these strange words with some lore of the skies which I had learnt from the Pnakotic manuscripts. My head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast, and when next I looked up it was in a dream; with the Pole Star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of a dream-swamp. And I am still dreaming. In my shame and despair I sometimes scream frantically, begging the dream-creatures around me to waken me ere the Inutos steal up the pass behind the peak Noton and take the citadel by surprise; but these creatures are daemons, for they laugh at me and tell me I am not dreaming. They mock me whilst I sleep, and whilst the squat yellow foe may be creeping silently upon us. I have failed in my duty and betrayed the marble city of Olatho\u00eb; I have proven false to Alos, my friend and commander. But still these shadows of my dream deride me. They say there is no land of Lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the Pole Star shines high and red Aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call \u201cEsquimaux\u201d. I have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which they belong."}

My pajamas were messy. My whole body was full of tiredness and annoyance. Full wakefulness came back very slowly. I could never tell when planned action stopped. I could never tell when sleepwalking movements began. There seemed to be a huge device with glowing numbers. There was a deep pit of sleep below it. There was a monstrous showing of the time. There was a loud, horrible sound at the set time. But how much of this was needed? My glasses were missing. Any clear goal I might have had was also missing. Had there been such a goal, or any pit, or any device? Raising my hand, I felt in front of me. I touched only the cold, hard plastic of the cursed machine.\n###\nI was fumbling blindly through the gloom of my bedchamber, and around me loomed such a profundity of shadows as I had never before known within my own domicile.

Everyone wondered why the ruined drug addict had such a portrait. Everyone wondered except the bank thief. He watched the invading police officers with worry. He had seen a under Old Bugs ' mask of ruin. the picture was given to Trever. The man changed. After his shock, he wrapped the tissue paper around the portrait. He seemed to want to protect it from the dirtiness of the place. he looked for a time at the body on the floor. He saw its height. He saw the shape of its face. This seemed that the flame of life had gone out. No, he said when asked. He did not know who was in the picture. He added it was. that no one could be expected to recognize it. But Alfred Trever did not tell the truth. people gusesed this when he offered to take care of the body. He offered to make it was buried in Appleton. An copy of that picture hung on the library fireplace in his home. All his life he had known and loevd the person. I do not wish to speak of the events at the Norton Mine on October 18th. a sense of duty to science makes me remember. I recall these scenes in the years of my life. They are filled with a fear that is because I can not explain it. But I believe I should tell what I know before I die. I should tell of theof Juan Romero. My name and background need not be told to people. In fact, I think it is they are not told. When a man moves to the States. The Colonies, he leaves his past., what I was has no connection to my story. Except one fact. During my service in India, I was with - teachers than with my officers. I had studied a amount of knowledge. disasters came upon me. These brought about my life in America 's West. In that life, I found it to accept a name. It is my name. It is and has no meanign.\n###\nNo one seemed able to place the subject, and all wondered that the drug-degraded derelict should have such a portrait in his possession\u2014that is, all but the bank defaulter, who was meanwhile eyeing the intruding bluecoats rather uneasily. He had seen a little deeper beneath Old Bugs\u2019 mask of utter degradation. Then the picture was passed to Trever, and a change came over the youth. After the first start, he replaced the tissue wrapping around the portrait, as if to shield it from the sordidness of the place. Then he gazed long and searchingly at the figure on the floor, noting its great height, and the aristocratic cast of features which seemed to appear now that the wretched flame of life had flickered out. No, he said hastily, as the question was put to him, he did not know the subject of the picture. It was so old, he added, that no one now could be expected to recognise it. But Alfred Trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in Appleton. Over the library mantel in his home hung the exact replica of that picture, and all his life he had known and loved its original. Of the events which took place at the Norton Mine on October 18th and 19th, 1894, I have no desire to speak. A sense of duty to science is all that impels me to recall, in these last years of my life, scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because I cannot wholly define it. But I believe that before I die I should tell what I know of the\u2014shall I say transition\u2014of Juan Romero. My name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact, I fancy it is better that they should not be, for when a man suddenly migrates to the States or the Colonies, he leaves his past behind him. Besides, what I once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative; save perhaps the fact that during my service in India I was more at home amongst white-bearded native teachers than amongst my brother-officers. I had delved not a little into odd Eastern lore when overtaken by the calamities which brought about my new life in America\u2019s vast West\u2014a life wherein I found it well to accept a name\u2014my present one\u2014which is very common and carries no meaning."}

We took careful note of this spot, planning to enter here unless a more easily gained interior were encountered. Finally, though, we did encounter exactly the opening we wished; an archway about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the former end of an a\u00ebrial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation. These archways, of course, were flush with upper-story floors; and in this case one of the floors still existed. The building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces on our left facing westward. That across the alley, where the other archway yawned, was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture. It was totally dark inside, and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable emptiness. Heaped debris made the entrance to the vast left-hand building doubly easy, yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the long-wished chance. For though we had penetrated into this tangle of archaic mystery, it required fresh resolution to carry us actually inside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world whose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us. In the end, however, we made the plunge; and scrambled up over the rubble into the gaping embrasure. The floor beyond was of great slate slabs, and seemed to form the outlet of a long, high corridor with sculptured walls. Observing the many inner archways which led off from it, and realising the probable complexity of the nest of apartments within, we decided that we must begin our system of hare-and-hound trail-blazing. Hitherto our compasses, together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain-range between the towers in our rear, had been enough to prevent our losing our way; but from now on, the artificial substitute would be necessary. Accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size, placed these in a bag to be carried by Danforth, and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow. This method would probably gain us immunity from straying, since there did not appear to be any strong air-currents inside the primordial masonry."}

He did not laugh when I paused. He asked about the boy who went in 1793. He had been the hero of my story. I told him why the boy had gone to that avoided, house. I said he ought to be, since he believed windows keep hidden images of those who had sat at them. The boy had gone to look at the windows of that attic. He went because of tales.\n###\nWith the years the legends take on a spectral character\u2014I suppose the thing, if it was a living thing, must have died. The memory had lingered hideously\u2014all the more hideous because it was so secret. During this narration my friend Manton had become very silent, and I saw that my words had impressed him. He did not laugh as I paused, but asked quite seriously about the boy who went mad in 1793, and who had presumably been the hero of my fiction. I told him why the boy had gone to that shunned, deserted house, and remarked that he ought to be interested, since he believed that windows retained latent images of those who had sat at them. The boy had gone to look at the windows of that horrible attic, because of tales of things seen behind them, and had come back screaming maniacally. Manton remained thoughtful as I said this, but gradually reverted to his analytical mood. He granted for the sake of argument that some unnatural monster had really existed, but reminded me that even the most morbid perversion of Nature need not be unnamable or scientifically indescribable. I admired his clearness and persistence, and added some further revelations I had collected among the old people. Those later spectral legends, I made plain, related to monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be; apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes only tangible, which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the old house, the crypt behind it, and the grave where a sapling had sprouted beside an illegible slab. Whether or not such apparitions had ever gored or smothered people to death, as told in uncorroborated traditions, they had produced a strong and consistent impression; and were yet darkly feared by very aged natives, though largely forgotten by the last two generations\u2014perhaps dying for lack of being thought about. Moreover, so far as aesthetic theory was involved, if the psychic emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions, what coherent representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a nebulosity as the spectre of a malign, chaotic perversion, itself a morbid blasphemy against Nature? Moulded by the dead brain of a hybrid nightmare, would not such a vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome truth the exquisitely, the shriekingly unnamable? \u201cThere were some bones up under the eaves. They may have been what that boy saw\u2014if he was sensitive he wouldn\u2019t have needed anything in the window-glass to unhinge him."}

This was, as the memoranda have stated, one of several procedural assemblies; during others of which we tried to discern new fiscal projections in reports untouched by previous committees. Our early meetings were disappointing in this latter respect; though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly convoluted and deceptive jargon of the corporate sphere, of which our initial briefing had given us some brief foretastes. Distant quarterly goals floated in the air as enchanted citadels, and often the whole grey world of data would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet realm of Dunsanian speculation and commercial expectancy under the magic of the dim fluorescent lights.

No longer used way of talking is beyond good telling. I have said I was both rejecting and mdae thoughtful. This says only roughly the extra tones of many. Mostly hidden understandings which made up both the rejection. To start, the device was. Completely different from the whole line of finger-based fresh things that came after it. The shift of use from key carrier to forgotten leftover. Even silliness was. I could hardly believe that a single ten years coul.d Change the tech view of one who had once depended on that noisy, time-based news of saved talk. No matter what handy other choices that time might have made. At some times a sense of clashing time errors maed me ask if this whole far-remembered custom of voice saving was not a sort of halff-ake ghost made mostly in my own memory.

To begin with, the apparatus was so antipodally at variance with the whole chain of digital innovations succeeding it\u2014the change of utility from vital conveyance to forgotten relic and even absurdity was so unheralded, lightning-like, and complete! I could scarcely believe that a single decade could so alter the technological perspective of one who had once relied upon that crackling, temporal bulletin of recorded speech, no matter what expedient alternatives that era might have wrought. At certain moments a sense of conflicting anachronisms made me wonder whether this whole distantly remembered ritual of vocal capture were not a kind of half-illusory phantom created largely within my own recollection.

He smiled at this fancy. But it seemed his smile held a touch of memory. I heard that a idea appeared in some of the tales of the folk. This idea referred to ghoulish, shapes taken by smoke from the chimney. It referred to contours assumed by tree - roots. These roots pushed their way into the cellar through foundation stones. Not until my adlut years did my uncle give me the notes. Data he had collected about the shunned house. Dr. Whipple was a, physician of the school.

I refer to a sort of cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor\u2014a vague, shifting deposit of mould or nitre which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen. Once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblance to a doubled-up human figure, though generally no such kinship existed, and often there was no whitish deposit whatever. On a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally strong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I glimpsed a kind of thin, yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace, I spoke to my uncle about the matter. He smiled at this odd conceit, but it seemed that his smile was tinged with reminiscence. Later I heard that a similar notion entered into some of the wild ancient tales of the common folk\u2014a notion likewise alluding to ghoulish, wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney, and queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree-roots that thrust their way into the cellar through the loose foundation-stones. Not till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and data which he had collected concerning the shunned house. Dr. Whipple was a sane, conservative physician of the old school, and for all his interest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts toward the abnormal. His own view, postulating simply a building and location of markedly unsanitary qualities, had nothing to do with abnormality; but he realised that the very picturesqueness which aroused his own interest would in a boy\u2019s fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome imaginative associations. The doctor was a bachelor; a white-haired, clean-shaven, old-fashioned gentleman, and a local historian of note, who had often broken a lance with such controversial guardians of tradition as Sidney S. Rider and Thomas W. Bicknell. He lived with one manservant in a Georgian homestead with knocker and iron-railed steps, balanced eerily on a steep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court and colony house where his grandfather\u2014a cousin of that celebrated privateersman, Capt. Whipple, who burnt His Majesty\u2019s armed schooner Gaspee in 1772\u2014had voted in the legislature on May 4, 1776, for the independence of the Rhode Island Colony."}

This was despite the paper trail we left. The tower 's opening was from the foothills. Our waiting plane than the terraced building we entered. Any exploration under the ice on this trip would be in this area., we were thinking about trips. This was we had seen and guessed., as we walked over the debris on the floor, we saw something. This sight pushed all thoughts for the moment. It was the, grouped line of three sledges. They were in that corner of the ramp 's, - reaching path. This spot had been hidden from our view until. they were. They were the three sledges missing from Lake 's camp. They showed signs of use. This must have included forced dragging over stretches of snowless stone and debris. It included carrying by hand over places. They were packed and strapped and. They contained things. There was the gasloine stove, fuel cans, instrument cases, food tins, and tarps. Some tarps bulged with books. Others bulged with contents. Everything came from Lake 's equipment. After what we found in that room, we were for this find. The shock came when we stepped and oepned one tarp. Its shape had disturbed us. It seems others besides Lake had been in colelcting samples. For there were two. Both were stiffly and preserved. They had plaster patches where some neck wounds were. They were wrapped with care to prevent damage. They were the bodies of Gedney and the missing dog. people will think us and. They will think this because we thought about the north tunnel. after our discovery. I am not to say we would have thought those thoughts. But a event happened to us. It started a line of thinking.\n###\nAs it was, the ramp shewed sad battering; whilst the choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently half-cleared. It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere. The tower\u2019s mouth was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered, and any further sub-glacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie in this general region. Oddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips\u2014even after all we had seen and guessed. Then as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time excluded all other matters. It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramp\u2019s lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view. There they were\u2014the three sledges missing from Lake\u2019s camp\u2014shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places. They were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and contained things memorably familiar enough\u2014the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging with books, and some bulging with less obvious contents\u2014everything derived from Lake\u2019s equipment. After what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for this encounter. The really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with patent care to prevent further damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog. Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our sombre discovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations."}

I offered to go with the cohort on any mission it might carry out. I noted that the uncivilized Vascones were at most unruly and unpredictable. Clashes with them were unavoidable eventually, no matter what we decided. They had not before been strong opponents for our legions. It would be wrong for the officials of the Roman People to let barbarians block a path that the fairness. Honor of the Republic required. On the other [THING], running a province well mainly relied on the security. Support of the civilized part of the population. They controlled the local systems of trade and wealth. Their veins carried a good amount of our own Italian blood. These [THING] might be fewer in number, but they were the steady part. Their loyatly could be trusted. Their help would most securely tie the province to Imperium of the Senate. It was both an obligation. A benefit to give them the protection owed to Roman citizens. This was true even. Here I gave a mocking glance at Balbutius. Asellius, if it cost some effort. It might also slightly interrupt the dice games and cockfights at the capm in Calagurris. I could not question from my studies thta the threat to the [THING]. [THING] of Pompelo was genuine. I had read many scrolls from Syria and \u00c6gyptus, and the mysterious towns of Etruria. I had spoken at length with the violent priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods near Lacus Nemorensis. There were terrible fates that could be summoned from the hills on the Sabbaths. These were fates that should not be present inside the lands of the Roman People. Allowing wild parties of the sort known to happen at Sabbaths would hardly match the traditions of those whose ancestors, when A. Postumius was consul, had put to death so many Roman citizens for practicing the Bacchanalia. This event is always remembered by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, carved on bronze. Displayed for all to see. Checked in time, before the advancement of the rituals might clal forth something that the iron of a Roman spear might not handle, the Sabbath would not be beyond the abilities of one cohort.\n###\nI, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake. I pointed out that the barbarous Vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain, so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever course we might take; that they had not in the past proved dangerous adversaries to our legions, and that it would ill become the representatives of the Roman People to suffer barbarians to interfere with a course which the justice and prestige of the Republic demanded. That, on the other hand, the successful administration of a province depended primarily upon the safety and good-will of the civilised element in whose hands the local machinery of commerce and prosperity reposed, and in whose veins a large mixture of our own Italian blood coursed. These, though in numbers they might form a minority, were the stable element whose constancy might be relied on, and whose cooperation would most firmly bind the province to the Imperium of the Senate and the Roman People. It was at once a duty and an advantage to afford them the protection due to Roman citizens; even (and here I shot a sarcastic look at Balbutius and Asellius) at the expense of a little trouble and activity, and of a slight interruption of the draught-playing and cock-fighting at the camp in Calagurris. That the danger to the town and inhabitants of Pompelo was a real one, I could not from my studies doubt. I had read many scrolls out of Syria and \u00c6gyptus, and the cryptic towns of Etruria, and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods bordering Lacus Nemorensis. There were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia\u2014a matter kept ever in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set open to every eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort."}

The floor was covered with, boxes and barrels. The place looked. But I did not care about that feeling. I went toward the staicrase. My flashlight showed the staircase. I looked at my watch. It showed the time was 2 a.m. The steps made noise when I stepped on them. But they seemed. I ran down past a floor that looked like a barn. I went to the ground floor. The place was. echoes answered my footsteps. I reached the hall. At one end I saw a, glowing rectangle. It marked the Paine Street doorway. Headign the direction, I found the door was. I rushed out and went fiev stone steps. I reached the courtyard. The courtyard had grass growing between the cobblestones. The moonlight did not reach. But I could see to move without using the flashlight. Some windows on the Gilman House side were giving off a glow. I thought I heard sounds from. Walking I moved to the Washington Street side. I saw doorways. I chose the one as my way. The hallway was. When I reached the end, I saw the street door was stuck. It would not move. Resolved I decided to try another building. I felt my way toward the courtyard. But I stopped when I was near the doorway. Because from an opened door in the Gilman House, a crowd of shapes was coming out. Lanterns weer moving and in the darkness., voices were making cries. They were not speaking English. The figures moved in an way. I realized with relief that they did not know where I had gone. But, they made me with horror. I could not see their faces. But their bent - ove,r shuffling walk was and. of all, I saw that one figure wore a robe. On its head was a tiara. The design of the tiara was to me. As the figures spread out across the courtyard, I felt. Suppose What if I could not find a way out of this building on the street side? The smell was. I was I could stand it without fainting. I felt my way toward the street. I opened a door off the hall. I entered an room. The room had windows that were but had no sashes.\n###\nThe distance was slight, however, so I clambered over the brink and dropped; striking a dusty floor littered with crumbling boxes and barrels. The place was ghoulish-looking, but I was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlight\u2014after a hasty glance at my watch, which shewed the hour to be 2 a.m. The steps creaked, but seemed tolerably sound; and I raced down past a barn-like second story to the ground floor. The desolation was complete, and only echoes answered my footfalls. At length I reached the lower hall, at one end of which I saw a faint luminous rectangle marking the ruined Paine Street doorway. Heading the other way, I found the back door also open; and darted out and down five stone steps to the grass-grown cobblestones of the courtyard. The moonbeams did not reach down here, but I could just see my way about without using the flashlight. Some of the windows on the Gilman House side were faintly glowing, and I thought I heard confused sounds within. Walking softly over to the Washington Street side I perceived several open doorways, and chose the nearest as my route out. The hallway inside was black, and when I reached the opposite end I saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut. Resolved to try another building, I groped my way back toward the courtyard, but stopped short when close to the doorway. For out of an opened door in the Gilman House a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouring\u2014lanterns bobbing in the darkness, and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not English. The figures moved uncertainly, and I realised to my relief that they did not know where I had gone; but for all that they sent a shiver of horror through my frame. Their features were indistinguishable, but their crouching, shambling gait was abominably repellent. And worst of all, I perceived that one figure was strangely robed, and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar. As the figures spread throughout the courtyard, I felt my fears increase. Suppose I could find no egress from this building on the street side? The fishy odour was detestable, and I wondered I could stand it without fainting. Again groping toward the street, I opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows."}

All at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short, sharp gasp. The others looked at him, and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly arrested. There was no need for words. What had been disputed in country gossip was disputable no longer, and it is because of the thing which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on that the strange days are never talked about in Arkham. It is necessary to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening. One did arise not long afterward, but there was absolutely none then. Even the dry tips of the lingering hedge-mustard, grey and blighted, and the fringe on the roof of the standing democrat-wagon were unstirred. And yet amid that tense, godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving. They were twitching morbidly and spasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked by some alien and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors writhing and struggling below the black roots. Not a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth passed over the moon, and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily. At this there was a general cry; muffled with awe, but husky and almost identical from every throat. For the terror had not faded with the silhouette, and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that treetop height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each bough like the fire of St. Elmo or the flames that came down on the apostles\u2019 heads at Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light, like a glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh; and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which Ammi had come to recognise and dread. All the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter, bringing to the minds of the huddled men a sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could form."}

This was despite the ice - and look of his hands. He understood my needs at a glance. He treated them with a master 's skill., he reassured me in a controlled but and toneless voice. He said he was the sworn enemy of death. He had spent his fortune. Lost all his friends in a lifetime of experiments. These were to defeating and destroying death. A Something of the kind but obsessed fanatic seemed to live in him. He talked on as he checked my chest. He mixed a drink of drugs fetched from the lab room. he found the company of a - born man a treat in this setting. Memories of days moved him to speech. His voice, if, was at calming. I could not tell that he breathed as the sentences came out.\n###\nI now saw that the hall room above mine\u2014the \u201cleetle room\u201d of bottles and machines which Mrs. Herrero had mentioned\u2014was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination. The figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned, and clad in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit. A high-bred face of masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short iron-grey full beard, and an old-fashioned pince-nez shielded the full, dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise dominantly Celtiberian. Thick, well-trimmed hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breeding. Nevertheless, as I saw Dr. Mu\u00f1oz in that blast of cool air, I felt a repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify. Only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have been excusable considering the man\u2019s known invalidism. It might, too, have been the singular cold that alienated me; for such chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day, and the abnormal always excites aversion, distrust, and fear. But repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician\u2019s extreme skill at once became manifest despite the ice-coldness and shakiness of his bloodless-looking hands. He clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master\u2019s deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation. Something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him, and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory room. Evidently he found the society of a well-born man a rare novelty in this dingy environment, and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over him. His voice, if queer, was at least soothing; and I could not even perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out."}

In that time, the Italians had gone with fear. People living near the feared church swore that the thing in the steeple had used the street - lamps being gone. It had gone down into the part of the church. It moved in a, way, flopping and bumping. Toward the, it had bumped up to the tower. There were sounds of glass breaking. It could go the darkness reached. But light would make it run. When the power came, there was a noise in the tower. the light coming through the, boarded windows was for the thing. It had bumped and slid up into its steeple in time. A time in the light would have sent it into the hole from where the stranger had called it. During the hour, praying crowds had gathered around the church in the rain. They had lighted candles and lamps. They shielded them with folded paper and umbrellas. This was a guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that walks in darkness., those to the church said the door had rattled. But this was not the. That evening, the Bulletin Blake read what the reporters had found. Aroused at to the news value of the scare, two of them had gone against the crowds of Italians. They had crawled into the church through the window after trying the doors wihtout success. They found the dust of the entrance hall. Of the church area plowed up in a way. Bits of cushions and satin pew coverings were scattered in a manner.\n###\nIn writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses a curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire. At the same time, however, he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination, and admits a morbid longing\u2014pervading even his dreams\u2014to visit the accursed tower and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone. Then something in the Journal on the morning of July 17 threw the diarist into a veritable fever of horror. It was only a variant of the other half-humorous items about the Federal Hill restlessness, but to Blake it was somehow very terrible indeed. In the night a thunderstorm had put the city\u2019s lighting-system out of commission for a full hour, and in that black interval the Italians had nearly gone mad with fright. Those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street-lamps\u2019 absence and gone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous, altogether dreadful way. Toward the last it had bumped up to the tower, where there were sounds of the shattering of glass. It could go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always send it fleeing. When the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the tower, for even the feeble light trickling through the grime-blackened, louver-boarded windows was too much for the thing. It had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in time\u2014for a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss whence the crazy stranger had called it. During the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas\u2014a guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness. Once, those nearest the church declared, the outer door had rattled hideously. But even this was not the worst. That evening in the Bulletin Blake read of what the reporters had found. Aroused at last to the whimsical news value of the scare, a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of Italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after trying the doors in vain. They found the dust of the vestibule and of the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way, with bits of rotted cushions and satin pew-linings scattered curiously around."}

There was than I could remember. what I did remember each morning would be to mark me as a madman. A genius if I dared write it down. I felt some influence was trying to drag me out of the world of life. It was pulling me into nameless depths of darkness and strangeness. The process weighed on me.\n###\nWhat I did was to faint silently away, just as I had done in that brier-choked railway cut a year before. From that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension, nor do I know how much is hideous truth and how much madness. My great-grandmother had been a Marsh of unknown source whose husband lived in Arkham\u2014and did not old Zadok say that the daughter of Obed Marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an Arkham man through a trick? What was it the ancient toper had muttered about the likeness of my eyes to Captain Obed\u2019s? In Arkham, too, the curator had told me I had the true Marsh eyes. Was Obed Marsh my own great-great-grandfather? Who\u2014or what\u2014then, was my great-great-grandmother? But perhaps this was all madness. Those whitish-gold ornaments might easily have been bought from some Innsmouth sailor by the father of my great-grandmother, whoever he was. And that look in the staring-eyed faces of my grandmother and self-slain uncle might be sheer fancy on my part\u2014sheer fancy, bolstered up by the Innsmouth shadow which had so darkly coloured my imagination. But why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in New England? For more than two years I fought off these reflections with partial success. My father secured me a place in an insurance office, and I buried myself in routine as deeply as possible. In the winter of 1930\u201331, however, the dreams began. They were very sparse and insidious at first, but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by. Great watery spaces opened out before me, and I seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy Cyclopean walls with grotesque fishes as my companions. Then the other shapes began to appear, filling me with nameless horror the moment I awoke. But during the dreams they did not horrify me at all\u2014I was one with them; wearing their unhuman trappings, treading their aqueous ways, and praying monstrously at their evil sea-bottom temples. There was much more than I could remember, but even what I did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever I dared write it down. Some frightful influence, I felt, was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnamable abysses of blackness and alienage; and the process told heavily on me."}

But our hard work and skill at throwing things away made us fast. What bothered us more was the talk from Clerk Henderson. It became crazier as night arrived. He was in a hatefully superstitious mood. He talked nonsense about some vision of old envelopes moving inside the cardboard boxes. He said these envelopes looked at him with evil intent. He said he knew them, even though they were yellowed. He said he had seen them sent out during some of our past money activities. He said the last warning letter we found. Cut up was their sign of things to come. This was very upsetting and not normal. So we kept Henderson in the extra romo and gave him a strong telling-off. The workers were not happy about his punishment, but we needed order. We also said no to a request from a group led by Intern Wilson. They wanted to throw the strange raised wax stamp into the fire.\n###\nIn the early evening we rose to the task, and found the pile less formidable. The dust of a forgotten decade was on the northern shelf, but our diligence and ability to discard made us efficient. What troubled us more was the talk of Clerk Henderson, which grew wilder as night came on. He was in a detestably superstitious state, and babbled of some illusion of faded envelopes shifting within the cardboard confines; envelopes which stared at him balefully, and which he recognised in spite of yellowing as having seen dispatched during some of our previous fiscal exploits. And he said that the final notice we had found and shredded was their harbinger. This was very unsettling and abnormal, so we confined Henderson to the annex and had him sternly reprimanded. The staff were not pleased at his censure, but order was necessary. We also denied the request of a delegation headed by Intern Wilson, that the curious embossed wax seal be cast into the furnace."}

He pushed it while looking for the Fenner casket. It was as he recognized Matt \u2019s coffin that the door slammed shut in the wind. This left him in a darkness than. The transom window let in the ryas. The ventilation funnel let in none. he was reduced to fumbling. He made his way among the boxes toward the latch. In this funeral twilight, he rattled the handles.

Birch, being and by nature, did not shout for. He proceeded to feel for some tools. He remembered seeing them in a corner of the tomb. It is he was affected by the horror and weirdness of his situation. The fact of being imprisoned. from where people walked was to annoy him. His day \u2019s work was interrupted. Unless chance brought some walker, he might have to stay all night. He reached the pile of tools. He selected a hammer and chisel. Birch went over the coffins to the door.

Sawyer was not a lovable man, and many stories were told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or fancied. To him Birch had felt no compunction in assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest for the Fenner casket. It was just as he had recognised old Matt\u2019s coffin that the door slammed to in the wind, leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before. The narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays, and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually none at all; so that he was reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward the latch. In this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles, pushed at the iron panels, and wondered why the massive portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant. In this twilight, too, he began to realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than neigh an unsympathetic reply. For the long-neglected latch was obviously broken, leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault, a victim of his own oversight. The thing must have happened at about three-thirty in the afternoon. Birch, being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout long; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb. It is doubtful whether he was touched at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position, but the bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly. His day\u2019s work was sadly interrupted, and unless chance presently brought some rambler hither, he might have to remain all night or longer. The pile of tools soon reached, and a hammer and chisel selected, Birch returned over the coffins to the door. The air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome; but to this detail he paid no attention as he toiled, half by feeling, at the heavy and corroded metal of the latch. He would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle; but lacking these, bungled semi-sightlessly as best he might. When he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding, at least to such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these, Birch glanced about for other possible points of escape."}

What I have dared to tell about my discoveries inside the cabinet has only brought me smiles of pity. My wife, who visits me often, says I never achieved the neat arrangmeent.

When he lifted the strange sharp - pointed obejct on the [THING], he thought the older pull toward the north grew a little stronger. But still, it was completely overcome by the newer and more confusing desire. He carried the sharp - pointed object down to Elwood \u2019s [THING]. He prepared himself against the crying sounds of the loom repairman that rose from the first [THING]. Elwood was in, thank goodness, and seemed to be moving around. There was time for a short talk before leaving for brekafast and school. So Gilman quickly told about his recent dreams and worries. His hsot was very understanding and agreed something should be done. He was shocked by his guest \u2019s tired, worn look. He noticed the odd, unusual - looking tan others had mentioned during the past week. But there was not much he could say. He had not seen Gilman on any sleepwalking trip. Had no idea what the curious object could be. He had heard the French - Canadian who lived right below Gilman talking to Mazurewicz one evening. They were telling each other how much they feared the coming of Walpurgis - Night, now only a few days aawy. They were sharing sorry comments about the poor, fated young [THING]. Desrochers, the [THING] under Gilman \u2019s [THING], had spoken of night footsteps both with shoes. He spoke of the violet light he saw one night when he fearfully crept up to look through Gilman \u2019s keyhole. He told Mazurewicz he had not dared to look after he saw that light through the cracks around the [THING]. There had been soft talking too. As he started to describe it, his voice dropped to a whisper too quiet to hear. Elwood could not imagine what started these superstitious [THING] gossiping. He supposed their imaginations were stirred by Gilman \u2019s late hours. Talking on one side. On the other side, it was stirred by the nearness of the traditionally feared May - Eve. That That Gilman talked in his sleep was clear. Obviously the false idea of the violet dream - light had spread from Desrochers \u2019 listening at keyholes. Tehse simple [THING] were quick to imagine they had seen any strange thing they had heard about. As for a plan \u2014 Gilman should move down to Elwood \u2019s [THING] and avoid sleeping alone. Elwood would, if awake, wake him whenever he started to talk. Get up in his sleep.\n###\nAs he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a trifle stronger; but even so, it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urge. He took the spiky image down to Elwood\u2019s room, steeling himself against the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor. Elwood was in, thank heaven, and appeared to be stirring about. There was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and college, so Gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent dreams and fears. His host was very sympathetic, and agreed that something ought to be done. He was shocked by his guest\u2019s drawn, haggard aspect, and noticed the queer, abnormal-looking sunburn which others had remarked during the past week. There was not much, though, that he could say. He had not seen Gilman on any sleep-walking expedition, and had no idea what the curious image could be. He had, though, heard the French-Canadian who lodged just under Gilman talking to Mazurewicz one evening. They were telling each other how badly they dreaded the coming of Walpurgis-Night, now only a few days off; and were exchanging pitying comments about the poor, doomed young gentleman. Desrochers, the fellow under Gilman\u2019s room, had spoken of nocturnal footsteps both shod and unshod, and of the violet light he saw one night when he had stolen fearfully up to peer through Gilman\u2019s keyhole. He had not dared to peer, he told Mazurewicz, after he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the door. There had been soft talking, too\u2014and as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisper. Elwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures gossiping, but supposed their imaginations had been roused by Gilman\u2019s late hours and somnolent walking and talking on the one hand, and by the nearness of traditionally feared May-Eve on the other hand. That Gilman talked in his sleep was plain, and it was obviously from Desrochers\u2019 keyhole-listenings that the delusive notion of the violet dream-light had got abroad. These simple people were quick to imagine they had seen any odd thing they had heard about. As for a plan of action\u2014Gilman had better move down to Elwood\u2019s room and avoid sleeping alone. Elwood would, if awake, rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep."}

They were strange and threatening, yet decorated with rich carvings and tempting sculptures. I wanted very MUCH to enter this city that was both attractive and frightening. I asked the bearded man to put me ashore at the stone pier by the huge carved gate Akariel. But he gently refused my wish. He said: \"Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have gone.

Into the sky the spires of its temples reached, so that no man might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim, grey walls, over which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and ominous, yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures.

Therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city.\u201d So the White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion, and followed for many days a southward-flying bird, whose glossy plumage matched the sky out of which it had appeared."}

A creature of sharp sensitivity. Stopped only by a cetrain underlying stian, which seemed to be a scent of real. Whihc did not appear to be of natural origin, snice I never called it floral. A air.

The sum of all my inhalation was, that in a kind of semi-corporeal olfactory dream I wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys of antiseptic purity, meadows of sterility, and palaces of clinical light; in a region unbounded and unknown to common perception. That there I was no mere visitor or transient, but a creature of acute sensitivity and vivid awareness; perceiving keenly and dominantly, and checked only by a certain underlying taint, which seemed to be a scent of palpable yet ethereal structure, and which did not appear to be of natural origin, since I never referred to it as floral, or as aught save a miasma. This miasma had done the atmosphere some hideous but unnamed wrong, which the vigilant observer (if observer I were) yearned to expunge. From the manner in which I alluded to their mingling, I judged that it and the pristine fragrance had met on equal terms; that in this olfactory existence the scent was itself a chemical thing of the same race as its enemy. This impression was sustained by my frequent references to drifting through sterile space and cleansing all that impeded its dominion. Yet these conceptions were formulated in common words wholly inadequate to convey them, a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a true scent-world indeed existed, oral language was not its medium for the transmission of essence. Could it be that the ethereal emanation inhabiting this inferior chamber was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dulness could not utter? Could it be that I was nostril to presence with chemical emanations which would explain the mystery if I could but learn to isolate and decipher them? I did not tell the other occupants of these things, for common sense is sceptical, cynical, and disinclined to accept new sensations. Besides, the nurse at the station had but lately warned me in her professional way that I was overthinking; that my senses needed a rest."}

Their senses could go through all material barriers, but their physical substance could not. Certain kinds of electrical energy could completely destroy them. They had the ability to move through the air even though they had no wings. Any other visible way to float. Their minds were of such a nature that no communication with them could be managed by the Great Race. When these beings came to Earth, they built powerful basalt cities with windowless towers. They hunted and fed horribly on the life forms they found. This was the situation when the minds of the Great Race traveled across space from thta unknown world beyond our galaxy. This world is called Yith in the troubling and disputed Eltdown Shards. The newcomers, using the tools they made, found it easy to defeat the predatory beings. They drove them down into the caves inside the [THING]. These caves were already connected to their homes and they had started living there. Then the newcomers sealed the entrances and left them to their fate. Afterward, thye took over most of their great cities. They kept some important buildings for reasons more related to superstition than to carelessness, bravery. As ages passed, there were unclear, evil signs that the Elder Things were becoming powerful. Numerous in the inner world. There were occasional, very hideous outbreaks in certain small and distant cities of the Great Race. This also happened in some of the empty ancient cities that the Great Race had not settled. These were places where the paths to the depths below had not been properly sealed. After that, greater care was taken. Many of the paths were closed forever. However, a few were left with sealed trap - doors. These were for strategic use in fighting the Elder Things if they ever broke out in unexpected places. This was due to fresh cracks caused by the same geological changes that had blocked some paths. These changes had also slowly reduced the number of outer - world buildings. Ruins left from the conquered beings. The outbreaks of the Elder Things must have been shocking beyond all words. They had permanently affected the psychology of the Great Race. The fixed feeling of horror was. Strong that the rather appearance of the creatures was never described. At no time was I able to get a clear idea of whta they looked like. There were hidden suggestions of a monstrous ability to change shape. There were hints of temporary moments when they became invisible.

When these things had come to the earth they had built mighty basalt cities of windowless towers, and had preyed horribly upon the beings they found. Thus it was when the minds of the Great Race sped across the void from that obscure trans-galactic world known in the disturbing and debatable Eltdown Shards as Yith. The newcomers, with the instruments they created, had found it easy to subdue the predatory entities and drive them down to those caverns of inner earth which they had already joined to their abodes and begun to inhabit. Then they had sealed the entrances and left them to their fate, afterward occupying most of their great cities and preserving certain important buildings for reasons connected more with superstition than with indifference, boldness, or scientific and historical zeal. But as the aeons passed, there came vague, evil signs that the Elder Things were growing strong and numerous in the inner world. There were sporadic irruptions of a particularly hideous character in certain small and remote cities of the Great Race, and in some of the deserted elder cities which the Great Race had not peopled\u2014places where the paths to the gulfs below had not been properly sealed or guarded.

Rider and Thomas W. Bicknell. He lived with one manservant in a Georgian homestead with knocker and iron-railed steps, balanced eerily on a steep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court and colony house where his grandfather\u2014a cousin of that celebrated privateersman, Capt. Whipple, who burnt His Majesty\u2019s armed schooner Gaspee in 1772\u2014had voted in the legislature on May 4, 1776, for the independence of the Rhode Island Colony. Around him in the damp, low-ceiled library with the musty white panelling, heavy carved overmantel, and small-paned, vine-shaded windows, were the relics and records of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusions to the shunned house in Benefit Street. That pest spot lies not far distant\u2014for Benefit runs ledgewise just above the court-house along the precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed. When, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from my uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enough chronicle. Long-winded, statistical, and drearily genealogical as some of the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding, tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me even more than it had impressed the good doctor. Separate events fitted together uncannily, and seemingly irrelevant details held mines of hideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate. The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine. For at last my uncle insisted on joining the search I had commenced, and after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me. I am lonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only with honour, virtue, good taste, benevolence, and learning. I have reared a marble urn to his memory in St. John\u2019s churchyard\u2014the place that Poe loved\u2014the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill, where tombs and headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the houses and bank walls of Benefit Street.

Since the driveway was on the other side of the house, it was clear the trip was not going straight. It had not been expected. It was simply following a general plan to make my task longer. This, however, meant that all paths leading to the mailbox were also blocked. The weather could not have known what route I planned to take.

The rules gave a clear picture of the laws which had once filled these vault-like, heayv streets. Above the common roads the edges were usually of offenses, tickets. Orders to court. But further from the middle this situation lessened. In some of the outer areas. streets there was more than overtimes. Meanwhile occasional spots had an eerie feel of newly bought relief. Of course, where meters were broken. Parts had fallen, the smaller voilations were as punished as the bigger ones. A central squaresaved the inner areas from total poverty. We rarely had to use our saved coins in the busier sections except when pleasing city workers. Below the main streets, however, the enforcement grew stronger. In many parts of the twisted business district there was a nearness to total lack of money.\n###\nAs I have said, all leniency and other mercies were absent; but the ordinances gave a clear idea of the strange statutes which had once filled these vault-like, oppressive streets.

In some of the outer districts and avenues there was little more than petty overstays or ancient grievances, while occasional spaces had an uncanny air of newly purchased reprieve. Of course, where meters were faulty or mechanisms had collapsed, the lesser infractions were as penalized as the greater ones. A central plaza\u2014as in other municipalities we had seen from reports\u2014saved the inner zones from total destitution; so that we seldom had to use our hoarded coins in the busier blocks except when appeasing municipal details. Below the main avenues, however, the enforcement deepened; and in many parts of the tangled commercial quarter there was an approach to absolute insolvency."}

It was so simple it was almost nothing. Under the conditions, no one could have seen it. Remember, I was in an office almost brand new except for the furniture. A well-balanced group of workers surrounded me. Worry would have been silly despite the place. What I later reemmbered is just this. The aged man in front of me, whose behavior I watched. Closely, was clearly upset. This was totally unlike normal line. He moved from foot to foot, restless and troubled. He kept looking toward the far counter that was part of the city building. I know how common this sounds. It is like the unavoidable clerk in the city story. That clerk always makes the person wait before they get the stamped paper. Yet I cannot always hold it back.\n###\nOn July 22 occurred the first incident which, though lightly dismissed at the time, takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later events. It was so simple as to be almost negligible, and could not possibly have been noticed under the circumstances; for it must be recalled that since I was in a bureau practically fresh and new except for the fixtures, and surrounded by a well-balanced staff of functionaries, apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality. What I afterward remembered is merely this\u2014that the elderly man before me, whose demeanour I observed so keenly, was undoubtedly agitated and uneasy to an extent wholly out of keeping with the common queue. He shifted from foot to foot, restless and disturbed, and glanced constantly toward the distant counter which formed part of the municipal architecture.

Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charles\u2019s direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck. The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects. In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred: The discovery took place at about four o\u2019clock, when Hart\u2019s attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter."}

Farewell, Randolph Carter, and beware; for I am Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos!\u201d And Randolph Carter, gasping and dizzy on his hideous shantak, shot screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal Vega; looking but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window above the air and the clouds of earth\u2019s dreamland. Great polypous horrors slid darkly past, and unseen bat-wings beat multitudinous around him, but still he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled bird.

He got off chair. He started moving toward me. He had a smile on his face with lips. I felt I was in danger. I took out the ray - projector to defend myself. I do not know why I thought it could help me. I turned it on. I aimed it at his face. I saw his skin shine violet and pink. His look of joy started to change. A look of fear appeared. But the joy did not go. He stopped walking. he waved his arms in the air. He began to stumble. I saw he was moving toward the stairwell in the floor. I tried to shout a warning. He did not hear me. A moment he fell through the opening. He disappeared from sight. I had trouble moving to the stairwell. When I got, I saw no body on the floor. I heard the sound of people coming up with lanterns. The spell of silence was broken. I could hear sounds and see people three - shapes. Something had brought a crowd to this place. Had there been a noise I did not hear? the two people saw me. They were villagers, it seemed. They stood. One of them screamed. The sound echoed. they all turned and ran in panic. All but one person ran. When the crowd was gone, I saw the man with the beard. He was the one who brought me. He stood with a lantern. He looked at me, gasping and. He did not seem. he started to climb the stairs. He joined me in the attic. He spoke. \" you did not leave it! I am. I know what has happened. It happened. That man got and shot himself. You should not have made him come. You know what he wants. But you must not get like that man he scared. Somtehing and has happened to you. But it did not go to damage your mind and who you are. If you stay. Accept that you need to make some changes in your life, you can continue to enjoy the world. You can enjoy the results of your studies.\n###\nHe slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark, thin-lipped face. I felt somehow in deadly peril, and drew out the peculiar ray-projector as a weapon of defence. Why I thought it could help me, I do not know. I turned it on\u2014full in his face, and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light. His expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear\u2014which did not, however, wholly displace the exultation. He stopped in his tracks\u2014then, flailing his arms wildly in the air, began to stagger backward. I saw he was edging toward the open stair-well in the floor, and tried to shout a warning, but he did not hear me. In another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to view. I found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well, but when I did get there I found no crushed body on the floor below. Instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and I once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri-dimensional. Something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place. Had there been a noise I had not heard? Presently the two people (simply villagers, apparently) farthest in the lead saw me\u2014and stood paralysed. One of them shrieked loudly and reverberently: Then they all turned and fled frantically. All, that is, but one. When the crowd was gone I saw the grave-bearded man who had brought me to this place\u2014standing alone with a lantern. He was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly, but did not seem afraid. Then he began to ascend the stairs, and joined me in the attic. He spoke: \u201cSo you didn\u2019t let it alone! I\u2019m sorry. I know what has happened. It happened once before, but the man got frightened and shot himself. You ought not to have made him come back. You know what he wants. But you mustn\u2019t get frightened like the other man he got. Something very strange and terrible has happened to you, but it didn\u2019t get far enough to hurt your mind and personality. If you\u2019ll keep cool, and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life, you can keep right on enjoying the world, and the fruits of your scholarship."}
