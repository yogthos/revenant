You are a precise text editor. Make surgical fixes to the text below.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. If the text ends mid-sentence, COMPLETE IT with a sensible ending
2. Do NOT repeat content - if something is already said, don't say it again
3. Weave missing terms into EXISTING sentences, don't add new paragraphs
4. Keep the existing vocabulary and sentence structure
5. Output ONLY the fixed text, no commentary or explanations
6. DELETE any sentences about topics marked for REMOVAL - these are invented content

STYLE PRESERVATION (critical for quality):
1. PRESERVE the existing sentence rhythm - do NOT create choppy fragments
2. Integrate missing content smoothly INTO existing sentences
3. Match the vocabulary level of the surrounding text
4. Maintain varied sentence lengths - avoid monotonous short sentences
5. Avoid stilted formal phrases (viz, herein, thus, hence, e.g.)
6. When adding content, ensure it flows naturally with context

BEFORE OUTPUTTING: Check that your output ends with a complete sentence (period, not mid-word)

AVOID AI PATTERNS - DO NOT USE:
- Transition words: "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally", "Consequently"
- Hedge phrases: "It is important to note", "It should be mentioned"
- Formal connectors: "In order to", "Due to the fact that"
- Precision markers: "specifically", "particularly", "fundamentally"
- Robotic verbs: "demonstrates", "indicates", "encompasses", "constitutes"
- Em dashes (—), semicolons (;), colons (:) - these are overused in AI text
- Archaic formality: "viz", "viz.", "i.e.", "e.g." - use plain English instead

INSTEAD USE: Natural flowing prose. Common words. Periods and commas. Varied rhythm.
