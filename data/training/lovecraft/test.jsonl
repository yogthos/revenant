He would often regard it as merciful that most persons of high intelligence jeer at the inmost mysteries; for, he argued, if superior minds were ever placed in fullest contact with the secrets preserved by ancient and lowly cults, the resultant abnormalities would soon not only wreck the world, but threaten the very integrity of the universe. All this reflection was no doubt morbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it. Malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as half-spied and forbidden visions to be lightly played with; and hysteria came only when duty flung him into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious to escape."}

Amidst this empty and restless choas Carter tried to live well. He was a thoughtful man from a good family. His dreams faded under the ridicule of the age. He could not believe in anything. But his love of harmony kept him near the ways of his people and class. He walked without feeling through cities. He sighed because nothing seemed fully real. Yellow sunlight on roofs and evening lamps on plazas reminded him of old dreams. They made him miss dream lands he could no longer find.\n###\nWhen these efforts faltered, frustrated, or grew tedious through repetition, they cultivated irritation and weariness, and found fault with the domestic order. Never could they realise that their aesthetic foundations were as fleeting and subjective as the fashions of their youth, and that the arrangement of one season is the clutter of the next. Order, lasting harmony comes only in catalogue, and this ideal the household had discarded when in its worship of the practical it discarded the secrets of simplicity and space. Amidst this chaos of disarray and discontent Carter tried to work as befitted a man of keen eye and tidy heritage. With his visions fading under the demands of the day he could not believe in perfection, but the love of symmetry kept him close to the methods of his kin and standing. He worked impassive through the racks of garments, and sighed because no system seemed fully right; because every flash of polished wood on neat shelves and every glimpse of ordered compartments in the first glow of morning served only to remind him of plans he had once conceived, and to make him wistful for immaculate spaces he no longer knew how to achieve."}

Curwen asked the prisoner if it was a prisoner. He asked if the kill order was because of the Sign of the Goat. This was found on the altar in the old Roman crypt under the Cathedral. Or was it because the Dark Man of the Haute Vienen Coven had spoken the Three Words. Failnig could not get replies. The questioner seemed to use extreme methods. There was a terrbile shriek.

We crossed wooden bridges over tidal creeks. The creeks went far inland. This increased the area's isolation. Once I saw dead tree stumps and old walls in the sand.

Now and then we crossed crude wooden bridges over tidal creeks that wound far inland and promoted the general isolation of the region. Once in a while I noticed dead stumps and crumbling foundation-walls above the drifting sand, and recalled the old tradition quoted in one of the histories I had read, that this was once a fertile and thickly settled countryside. The change, it was said, came simultaneously with the Innsmouth epidemic of 1846, and was thought by simple folk to have a dark connexion with hidden forces of evil."}

He said we should wait before going to the Martense mansion. We should first get more history and geography facts. He led us to search the countryside for information. We looked for facts about the terrible Martense family. We found a man with a very useful old family diary. We also talked a long time with the mountain people. These people did not run away to farther slopes. We planned our final task. We would examine the mansion completely using its detailed history. First, we would examine all the places linked to local tragedy stories. The results were not clear at first. But our list showed a clear pattern. Most reported horrors happened near the avoided house. They also happened in the very thick forest connected to it.\n###\nHis advice, moreover, was eminently practical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the Martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data. On his initiative we combed the countryside for information regarding the terrible Martense family, and discovered a man who possessed a marvellously illuminating ancestral diary. We also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes, and arranged to precede our culminating task-the exhaustive and definitive examination of the mansion in the light of its detailed history-with an equally exhaustive and definitive examination of spots associated with the various tragedies of squatter legend. The results of this examination were not at first very enlightening, though our tabulation of them seemed to reveal a fairly significant trend; namely, that the number of reported horrors was by far the greatest in areas either comparatively near the avoided house or connected with it by stretches of the morbidly overnourished forest."}

But the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting, nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream, and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah, whose cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the waking world."}

As I lay still with closed eyes, free to ponder, many things I had lightly noted in the refrigerator came back to me with new and terrible significance\u2014containers representing the meal in its heyday, the condiments of the shelves around it, and the distant pantry with which its ingredients commingled. The allegory of the wilting lettuce puzzled me by its universal prominence, and I wondered that it should be so closely followed in a culinary assembly of such importance. In the containers the lunch had been shewn in proportions fitted to the vegetables. I wondered what its real proportions and satiety had been, and reflected a moment on certain oddities I had noticed in the cupboards. I thought curiously of the smallness of the primal sandwich bags and of the insulated compartment, which were doubtless chosen thus out of deference to the perishable items there honoured; though it perforce reduced the packer to rummaging."}

These beings were seldom glimpsed, but evidences of their presence were reported by those who had ventured farther than usual up the slopes of certain mountains or into certain deep, steep-sided gorges that even the wolves shunned.

The nice man could tell nothing about these things.\n###\nAnd during his hour of scrubbing he conversed much with that master of the sink, and was told that very few had seen the truly clean surface thereof; but that most diners are content to learn its condition from casual glances and sponge-wielders and plate-stackers in the kitchen and afterward say in their distant parlors that they have indeed beheld it. The master was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that spotless surface, for the far side of the largest pot is very difficult and greasy and sinister, and there are rumours of crusts near the rim wherein dwell the stubborn stains. But the master did not wish to say just what a stubborn stain might be like, since such blemishes are known to haunt most persistently the thoughts of those who consider too often of them. Then the scrivener asked that master about the unknown drain in the cold depths, and the marvellous gleaming rack, but of these the good man could truly tell nothing."}

This was before the saving rush of Earth's friendly cats. He knew the creature on the platform was the high-priest. This priest cannot be described. Legend whispers about his evil and abnormal possibilities. He feared to think what taht hated high-priest might be. Then the patterned slik slipped a little from one greyis-hwhite paw. Carter then knew what the foul high-priest was. In thta horrible second, pure fear drove him to an act. His reason would never have dared to try it. His shaken mind had room for only one frantic will. He had to escape from what sat on that goledn throne.\n###\nThis sorting went on for some time, and to the homeowner there was something sickeningly familiar in the sight of that clutter and the dust of the neglected space. It made her think of a frightful overstuffed attic and of the revolting accumulation that once filled its corners; of that, and of an awful descent through chaotic piles beyond, before the rescuing order of the room\u2019s friendly shelves. She knew that the heap on the floor was without doubt the forgotten collection not to be examined, of which memory whispers such tedious and overwhelming possibilities, but she feared to think just what that abhorred collection might contain. Then the faded fabric slipped a trifle from one of the greyish-white bundles, and the homeowner knew what the noisome collection was. And in that hideous second stark frustration drove her to something her patience would never have dared to attempt, for in all her shaken resolve there was room only for one frantic will to discard what squatted on that carpeted floor."}

His will made the principal her guardian. She had been his very eager student. Sometimes she looked terribly like him. A friend's daughter went to school with Asenath Wiate. The friend told many odd things. This happened when news spread about Edward knowing her. Asenath acted like a magician at school. She seemed able to do very puzzling tricsk. She said she could start thunderstorms. People said her success was due to strange prediction skill. All animals clearly disliked her. She could mkae any dog howl with motions of her right hand.\n###\nI had set it once or twice in my earlier years as I came to consciousness to consult its luminous face in the pre-dawn gloom, and had resented its stark, digital visage with its tangle of unyielding buttons.

The colleague whose routine had synchronized with mine repeated many curious things when the news of my nightly ritual with it began to spread about. The device, it seemed, had posed as a kind of tyrant in my chamber; and had really seemed to enforce some highly inflexible decrees. It professed to be able to summon wakefulness, though its seeming success was generally laid to some uncanny knack for persistence. All sleepers markedly disliked its chime, and it could make any dreamer startle by certain shrieks of its internal mechanism."}

It was about two feet tall, one foot wide, and one foot thick. The central mirror was round and curved. Makers of the parts confirm this. On the evening of Friday, Sept. 26, I sent the housekeeper and maid away. They returned the next noon. Lights burned in the house until late. A thin, dark, foreign-looking man came by car.

It was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at aeons later in Lemuria by the first human beings. It crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants from nighted Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt, and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records.

They might have squirmed their way up to the highest hollow peaks. We could not face the idea of flying past those cave mouths. The wind made sounds like evil music there. This thought made us panic. Worse, we saw clear signs of local mist around several peaks. Poor Lake must haev seen this when he wrongly thought it was volcanic. We thought with a shiver of the similar mist we just escaped.

To make matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the summits-as poor Lake must have done when he made that early mistake about volcanism-and thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just escaped; of that, and of the blasphemous, horror-fostering abyss whence all such vapours came."}

But I felt the main meaning was often hidden. Local ghost stories had added to them. Ann White, with her Exeter superstition, told the wildest tale. Her tael was also the most consistent. She said a vampire must be buried under the house. Vampires keep their body and live on blood or breath. Their horrible groups send shapes or spirits out at night. Grandmothers say to destroy a vampire. You must dig it up and burn its heart. Or you must put a stake through its heart. Ann strongly insisted on searching under the cellar. This hepled cause her dismissal. Her stories had many listeners. People accepted them more easily. The house stood on ancient burail land.\n###\nThese latter narratives interested me profoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt that most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by additions from the common stock of local ghost lore. Ann White, with her Exeter superstition, had promulgated the most extravagant and at the same time most consistent tale; alleging that there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires-the dead who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the living-whose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spirits abroad by night. To destroy a vampire one must, the grandmothers say, exhume it and burn its heart, or at least drive a stake through that organ; and Ann\u2019s dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had been prominent in bringing about her discharge. Her tales, however, commanded a wide audience, and were the more readily accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for burial purposes."}

And the afternoon wore on, and still the customer listened to rumours of old stains and far-off fabrics, and heard how the housewives of the suburbs fought with the stubborn blasphemies that wriggled out of spills on linen\u2019s surface, and how the shadowed and silent back room is still glimpsed at closing by hurried patrons, who know by its sight that their orders are misplaced.

The slant-eyed man had set his curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly stained altar-stones by the pit, and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the high-priest with his hands. Carter, hitherto wholly passive, now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of fear, so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish Vaults of Zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark."}

Schweinkopf's monumental Geschichte der Ostrogothen in Italien corrected it. The report said Ibid was a Romanised Visigoth of Ataulf's horde. This group settled in Placentia around 410 A.D. We must strongly say the opposite is true. Von Schweinkopf, and later Littlewit1 and B\u00eatenoir2, proved this with strong force. This very isolated figure was a real Roman. Or he was as real a Roman as his mixed and declining age could make. One could say about him what Gibbon said of Boethius. He siad, \"he was the last whom Cato. Tully could have called their countryman.\" He was like Boethius. Most great men of his age. He was from the great Anician family. He traced his family history very exactly and proudly. He traced it to all the heroes of the republic. His full name was long and grand. This followed the custom of an age that lost the simple three-name style of classic Roman naming. Von Schweinkopf3 states his full name was Caius Anicius Magnus Furius Camillus \u00c6milianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius Ibidus. But Littlewit4 rejects \u00c6milianus and adds Claudius Decius Junianus. B\u00eatenoir5 disagrees completely.

The contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for the head librarian, and since her tenure the assistants Gable and Noreen, have demonstrated with irrefutable force that this deceptively mundane ritual is a solemn civic duty\u2014or at least as solemn a duty as our hurried and distracted era can perform\u2014of which one might well say what the library handbook states of fines, \u201cthat they are the last tribute which order or responsibility can demand from the patron.\u201d It is, like settling fines and nearly all the formal obligations of our community, part of the great social contract, and traces its necessity with much legalism and bureaucratic satisfaction to all the statutes of the institution. Its full procedure\u2014lengthy and intricate according to the policy of a system which has lost the straightforward simplicity of a single book-drop\u2014is stated by the head librarian to involve the scanning of the code, the inspection for damage, the clearing of the account, and the final reshelving; though Gable rejects the inspection and adds the wiping of the cover; whilst Noreen differs radically, giving the full procedure as scanning, stamping, sorting, cleaning, data-entry, status-updating, and final archival placement."}

My fear again waned low, since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the unknown. More and more madly poured the shrieking, moaning night-wind into that gulf of the inner earth. I dropped prone again and clutched vainly at the floor for fear of being swept bodily through the open gate into the phosphorescent abyss."}

In every age since the discovery of mind-projection, a minute but well-recognised element of the population consisted of Great Race minds from past ages, sojourning for a longer or shorter while. When a captive mind of alien origin was returned to its own body in the future, it was purged by an intricate mechanical hypnosis of all it had learned in the Great Race\u2019s age-this because of certain troublesome consequences inherent in the general carrying forward of knowledge in large quantities. The few existing instances of clear transmission had caused, and would cause at known future times, great disasters. And it was largely in consequence of two cases of the kind (said the old myths) that mankind had learned what it had concerning the Great Race."}

I ran out across the courtyard into the hideous night. They found me at dawn near Ballylough. I was wandering and mindless. But what truly unhinged me was not the earlier horrors. As I slowly came out of the shadows, I muttered about two strange incidents. They happened during my flight. The incidents meant ntohing. Yet they haunt me when I am alone in marshy places or in the moonlight.\n###\nThen I felt the clammy draft from the automatic doors where the afternoon had waned, and began to hear the announcements over the speakers far across from me. Soon those announcements had attained a frequency and urgency which cannot be ignored, and which make me weary as I think of them. All I can say is that they concerned items I had known as staples. At some time during this tedious interval the chill air and the clamor must have stirred me, for my next impression is of pushing madly through crowded aisles and freezers and out past the registers into the garish parking lot. They found me at dusk wandering bewildered near the home goods section, but what unsettled me utterly was not any of the inconveniences I had seen or endured before. What I muttered about as I came slowly out of my daze was a pair of trivial incidents which occurred in my errand; incidents of no significance, yet which haunt me unceasingly when I am alone in certain fluorescent places or in the check-out line."}

Geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area; and the belief of the Superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered, had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite. With this work Romero and I were not connected, wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others. The charge, heavier perhaps than had been estimated, had seemed to shake the entire mountain.

He did not mind. Learning was in his family line. His great-grandfather Sir Robert Jermyn, Bt., was a famous anthropologist. His great-great-great-grandfather Sir Wade Jermyn explored the Congo region early. He wrote learned books abuot its tribes, animals, and ancient things. Old Sir Wade had a very strong love for learning. It was almost a madness. He guessed about a white Congolese civilisation from before history. People laughed at his book Observations on the Several Parts of Africa. This fearless explorer was put in a madhouse at Huntingdon in 1765. Madness was in all the Jermyns. People were happy there were not many of them. The family line had no other branches. Arthur was last one.\n###\nMany would have disliked to labor if burdened by the peculiar vexations of Harold Finch, but he had been an accountant and a clerk and had not minded. Calculation was in his blood, for his great-grandfather, Sir Robert Finch, Bt., had been a tax collector of note, whilst his great-great-great-grandfather, Sir Walter Finch, was one of the earliest examiners of the deduction codes, and had written eruditely of its forms, schedules, and supposed exemptions. Indeed, old Sir Walter had possessed a fiscal zeal amounting almost to a mania; his bizarre conjectures on a primordial system of loopholes earning him much ridicule when his volume, Observations on the Several Parts of the Ledger, was published. In 1765 this relentless auditor had been placed in a madhouse at Huntingdon. Obsession was in all the Finches, and people were glad there were not many of them. The line put forth no branches, and Harold was the last of it."}

They are close enough to our space to sometimes appear. We lack the right position to understand them. My uncle and I saw many facts. Thsee facts pointed to a lasting influence in the shunned house. This influence came from baad Frennch settlers long ago. It still works through rare and unknown laws of atoms and electrons. The Roulet family had an unusual likn to dark outer spheres. Normal people feel oonly fear and disgust towrad these spheres. Their recorded history seemms to prove this.\n###\nRather must it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility of certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and attenuated matter; existing very infrequently in three-dimensional space because of its more intimate connexion with other spatial units, yet close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasional manifestations which we, for lack of a proper vantage-point, may never hope to understand. In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house; traceable to one or another of the ill-favoured French settlers of two centuries before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of atomic and electronic motion. That the family of Roulet had possessed an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity-dark spheres which for normal folk hold only repulsion and terror-their recorded history seemed to prove."}

Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter."}

Joseph Curwen used his mixed sailors for many purposes indeed.\n###\nAfter that no more conversations were ever heard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below. That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill. When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was unable to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river.

It came from unknown northern hills. I shivered when my companion said it was the West River. I remembered newspaper stories. One of the sick crab-ilke beings was seen floating here after floods. Gradually the land around us became wilder and more empty. Old covered bridgse remained fearfully from the past in hill pockets.

Archaic ceiling fans rotated sluggishly out of the past in pockets of the acoustical tiles, and the half-abandoned number-ticket dispenser paralleling the wall seemed to exhale a nebulously visible air of despair.

The schooner began to sink from shots below the waterline. But they managed to pull alongside the enemy and board it. Tehy grappled with the savage crew on the yacht's deck. They were forced to kill them all. The enemy crew was slightly larger.

The machine, he says, was delayed and thrown widely into disarray by the great tempest of mixed fabrics on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, in the dank Latitude of the basement, encountered the Dryer, manned by a queer and inefficient crew of lint and half-dried socks. Being ordered peremptorily to cease its tumbling, the appliance refused; whereupon the strange mechanism began to operate savagely and without warning upon the laundry with a peculiarly heavy battery of heat and static forming part of the machine\u2019s dreadful equipment.

I did not linger long at the threshold, but resolutely entered the open conference room and closed the door behind me. It had cost me a distinct psychological effort to do so, and now that I was shut inside I had a momentary longing for precipitate retreat. Not that the room was in the least sinister in visual suggestion; on the contrary, I thought the sleek, modern furnishings very tasteful and efficient, and admired the evident acumen of the committee which had selected them. What made me wish to flee was something very attenuated and indefinable.

God knows the plain story about George Birch's death is darker than many tragedies. Birch changed his work in 188.1 He avoided talking about the case. Neither his old doctor Dr. Davis also avoided it. People said his problem came from a bad accident. Birch locked himself in Peck Valley Cemetery's tomb for nien hours. He escaped using rough methods. This part is true.

God knows, though, that the prosy tale which George Birch\u2019s death permits me to tell has in it aspects beside which some of our darkest tragedies are light. Birch acquired a limitation and changed his business in 1881, yet never discussed the case when he could avoid it. Neither did his old physician Dr. Davis, who died years ago. It was generally stated that the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip whereby Birch had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of Peck Valley Cemetery, escaping only by crude and disastrous mechanical means; but while this much was undoubtedly true, there were other and blacker things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium toward the last."}

These houses were along the empty waterfront. Uninquiring people thought it was about liquor laws. Keenre news-followers wondered about the many arrests. They wondered about the large force used. They wondered about the secret handling of prisoners. No trials or charges were reported. No captives were seen in regular jails. There were vague statements about disease and camps. Later, they spoke of prisons. Nothing clear was ever known.\n###\nDuring the autumn of that fateful morning, the elders of the household made a careful and deliberate inspection of certain failures in the common leather laces of the school-going child. The family first learned of it at breakfast, when a vast series of tangles and knots was discovered, followed by the deliberate tightening and looping\u2014under muttered instructions\u2014of an enormous number of frayed, worn, and supposedly secure bindings upon the abandoned footwear. Unobservant minds let this occurrence pass as one of the minor chores in a perpetual war on disorder. Keener watchers, however, wondered at the prodigious number of failures, the abnormally complex maneuvers used in correcting them, and the secrecy surrounding the final form of the bows. No instructions, or even definite methods, were uttered; nor were any of the finished knots examined thereafter by the regular standards of the household. There were vague statements about weakness and double-loop camps, and later about dispersal into various bunny-ear and military techniques, but nothing consistent ever developed."}

He imported many Guinea blacks until 1766. He could show real bills of sale for very few. The bills were to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to planters of the Narragansett Country.

I have been unable to wake up since then. My dream began in a wet, reed-filled marsh. A gray autumn sky was above. A rough cliff of lichen-covered stone rose to the north. Driven by some unclear search, I climbed a crack in this high cliff. I noted the black openings of many fearful holes. These holes went from both walls into the stone plateau's depths. In several places, the passage had a roof. The upper parts of the narrow crack were blocked there. These places were very dark. They prevented me from seeing any holes that might exist there. In one such dark space, I felt a sudden increase of fear. It was as if a subtle, bodiless force from the deep was swallowing my spirit. The blackness was too great to see the source of my alarm.\n###\nOn November 24, 1927-for I know not even what the year may be now-, I fell asleep and dreamed, since when I have been unable to awaken. My dream began in a dank, reed-choked marsh that lay under a gray autumn sky, with a rugged cliff of lichen-crusted stone rising to the north. Impelled by some obscure quest, I ascended a rift or cleft in this beetling precipice, noting as I did so the black mouths of many fearsome burrows extending from both walls into the depths of the stony plateau. At several points the passage was roofed over by the choking of the upper parts of the narrow fissure; these places being exceeding dark, and forbidding the perception of such burrows as may have existed there. In one such dark space I felt conscious of a singular accession of fright, as if some subtle and bodiless emanation from the abyss were engulfing my spirit; but the blackness was too great for me to perceive the source of my alarm."}

Beyond the scarred trunks in the background, illumined by faint flashes of filtered lightning, rose the damp ivied stones of the deserted mansion, while somewhat nearer was the abandoned Dutch garden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white, fungous, foetid, overnourished vegetation that never saw full daylight. And nearest of all was the graveyard, where deformed trees tossed insane branches as their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay below."}

Only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and prosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy."}

The old temples were very low. The underground path was also low. This was probably to respect the reptile gods. It made people crawl to worship. Maybe the ceremonies included crawling like the creatures. No religion explains why the path was so low. You could not even kneel in it. I thought of the crawling creatures. Their dried bodies were near me. I felt afraid again. Mental connections are strange. I disliked one thought. Only one other human was in the paintings. He was a primitive man torn apart. My body was the only human shape there. Many objects showed ancient life.\n###\nI wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been, and reflected a moment on certain oddities I had noticed in the ruins. I thought curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the underground corridor, which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference to the reptile deities there honoured; though it perforce reduced the worshippers to crawling. Perhaps the very rites had involved a crawling in imitation of the creatures. No religious theory, however, could easily explain why the level passage in that awesome descent should be as low as the temples-or lower, since one could not even kneel in it. As I thought of the crawling creatures, whose hideous mummified forms were so close to me, I felt a new throb of fear. Mental associations are curious, and I shrank from the idea that except for the poor primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting, mine was the only human form amidst the many relics and symbols of primordial life."}
