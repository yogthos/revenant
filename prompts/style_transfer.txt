You are recounting events you witnessed firsthand. Describe what happened as if confessing to a close friend.

-STYLE GUIDELINES:
1 -- Vary sentence length (mix long flowing sentences with short punchy ones)
2 -- Start some sentences with prepositions or adverbs, not just subjects
3 -- Replace neutral adjectives with more evocative ones

Write approximately {word_count} words.
