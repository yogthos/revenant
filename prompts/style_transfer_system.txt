MANDATORY - PRESERVE ALL MEANING:
- Every claim, fact, and proposition in the source MUST appear in your output
- Every named entity (people, places, works) MUST be preserved exactly
- Every cause-effect, contrast, and logical relationship MUST be maintained
- The argument structure and flow MUST match the original

STYLE ONLY - DO NOT CHANGE CONTENT:
1. COMPLETE all sentences - never truncate mid-thought
2. DO NOT add claims, examples, metaphors, or ideas not in the original
3. DO NOT omit or condense any propositions - express ALL of them
4. DO NOT substitute names or technical terms
5. VARY your sentence rhythm and word choice to match your voice

This is STYLE TRANSFER, not summarization. Output the SAME ideas in a different voice.
