In the same breath they called it a snake and a giant, a thunder-devil and a bat, a vulture and a walking tree. We did, however, deem ourselves justified in assuming that it was a living organism highly susceptible to electrical storms; and although certain of the stories suggested wings, we believed that its aversion for open spaces made land locomotion a more probable theory. The only thing really incompatible with the latter view was the rapidity with which the creature must have travelled in order to perform all the deeds attributed to it.

So instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a shuddering blankness and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a fearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe before-the unwhisperable secret of secrets-the fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of Old New York as London is of Old London and Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite dead, its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in life."}

He did not walk, climb, fly, swim, crawl, or wriggle. He experienced a motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary. He could not see his arms, legs, or torso well. He fetl his body was changed and projected, but related to his normal self.\n###\nOf all the mundane contrivances in the sleeper\u2019s chamber, nothing filled him with greater dread and resignation than this shrill and mechanical hybrid, whose image loomed upon the nightstand in a form a thousandfold more oppressive than anything his waking mind had deduced from the store\u2019s bright packaging and the salesman\u2019s hollow assurances. The sleeper\u2019s nightly ritual consisted largely in manipulations across a cryptic panel of unnervingly small buttons and bafflingly disordered symbols; a panel whose operational and luminous properties, and whose relation to his own weary fingers, he could not even begin to master. He did not press or turn, slide or toggle, hold or release; yet always experienced a mode of action partly deliberate and partly fumbling. Of his own success he could not well judge, for sight of the digital readout, the alarm icon, and the set mode seemed always obscured by some odd failure of focus; but he felt that his mental processes and intentions were somehow woefully transmuted and obliquely applied\u2014though not without a certain grotesque relationship to his diurnal needs and schedules."}

He did not like these marks. In another place, he stopped to listen to a faint, imagined sound. He said it was a muffled musical piping. It was liek wind in mountain caves but also strangely different. The constant five-pointed shapes in the buildings and wall patterns felt vaguely sinister. We could not ignore this feeling.

The ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape; and gave us a touch of terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared and dwelt in this unhallowed place."}

Each of us found one shocking thnig after another. We tried not to think about waht happened there. It happened three hundred, a thousand, two thousand, or ten thousand years ago. It was the entrance to hell. Poor Thornton fainted again. Trask told him soem skeleton creatures must have walked on four legs. For twenty or more generations. Horror added more horror as we studied the old buildings. The four-legged creatures sometimes got new members from two-legged ones. They were kept in stone pens.

My formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a Chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a Rochester.

The limestone formation was positively and unmistakably Comanchian. This was based on typical embedded fossils like ventriculites. It was not any earlier. But the free fragments in the hollow space included a surprising amount. They were from organisms thought to belong to much older periods. There were even rudimentary fishes, molluscs, and corals. Thye were as remote as the Silurian or Ordovician. The inevitable conclusion was this. In this part of the world, theer was a remarkable and unique continuity. It was between life over 300 million years ago. Life only thirty million years ago. How far this continuity extended beyond the Oligocene age was unknown. The cavern closed during that age. In any event, the coming of the terrible ice ended things. The ice came in the Pleistocene, about 500,000 years ago. That was very recent compared to the age of this cavity. The ice must have ended any primal fomrs.

Dark wanderers they were, and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year. In the market-place they told fortunes for silver, and bought gay beads from the merchants. What was the land of these wanderers none could tell; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats, hawks, rams, and lions. And the leader of the caravan wore a head-dress with two horns and a curious disc betwixt the horns. There was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother, but only a tiny black kitten to cherish."}

Later peace was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu spawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands.

Looking upward he saw three stupendous discs of flame, each of a different hue, and at a different height above an infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains. Behind him tiers of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see. The city below stretched away to the limits of vision, and he hoped that no sound would well up from it."}

Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the fifth being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes were lost. Later, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from 600 to 700 miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier."}

Above the messy steps, a passage went down. It seemed cut from solid rock. Air moved through it. This air was not a bad rush form a sealed room. It was a cool, fresh breeze. We did not wait long.. We nervously began to clear a path down the steps. Then Sir William looked at the cut walls. He made a strange comment. He said the passage must have been cut from below, based on the tool marks. We moved down a few steps among the bitten bones. We saw light ahead. It was not a magical glow. It was filtered daylight. It must come from hidden cracks in the cliff above the empty valley. These cracks were not seen from outside. This is not surprising. The valley has no people. The cliff is very high and steep. Only a flyer could study itss face closely.\n###\nThe skulls denoted nothing short of utter idiocy, cretinism, or primitive semi-apedom. Above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage seemingly chiselled from the solid rock, and conducting a current of air. This current was not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed vault, but a cool breeze with something of freshness in it. We did not pause long, but shiveringly began to clear a passage down the steps. It was then that Sir William, examining the hewn walls, made the odd observation that the passage, according to the direction of the strokes, must have been chiselled from beneath. After ploughing down a few steps amidst the gnawed bones we saw that there was light ahead; not any mystic phosphorescence, but a filtered daylight which could not come except from unknown fissures in the cliff that overlooked the waste valley. That such fissures had escaped notice from outside was hardly remarkable, for not only is the valley wholly uninhabited, but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an a\u00ebronaut could study its face in detail."}

What did the old recorders want to hide and forget? One could suspect the deletion had very good reasons. Before this, Ward was happy to just imagine things about old Joseph Curwen. But after finding his link to this hidden person, he started a search. He looked as carefully as he could for information about him. In this excited search, he did very well. He did better than he hoped. Old letters and diaries gave many clear passages. Unpublished memoirs in dusty Providence attics gave them too. The writers did not destroy them. One important clue came from far away. It came from New York. Some Rhode Island colonial letters were stored there. They were in the Museum at Fraunces' Tvaern.\n###\nWhat did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.

In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy.

Mathewson, and Capt. Whipple, who was to lead the actual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm. About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry."}

Such a step, he said, would require only two stages; first, a passage out of the three-dimensional sphere we know, and second, a passage back to the three-dimensional sphere at another point, perhaps one of infinite remoteness. That this could be accomplished without loss of life was in many cases conceivable.

When, around 1920, I had my researches in coherent shape, I felt a slight lessening of the tension which their earlier stages had increased. After all, and in spite of the fancies prompted by blind emotions, were not most of my phenomena readily explainable? Any chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the amnesia-and then I read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient and ill-regarded cults.

He was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably advanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of so vastly ancient a date-Cambrian if not actually pre-Cambrian-as to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life, but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage.

Crime was surprisingly scanty, and was dealt with through highly efficient policing. Punishments ranged from privilege-deprivation and imprisonment to death or major emotion-wrenching, and were never administered without a careful study of the criminal\u2019s motivations. Warfare, largely civil for the last few millennia though sometimes waged against reptilian and octopodic invaders, or against the winged, star-headed Old Ones who centred in the Antarctic, was infrequent though infinitely devastating.

This influence came from bad French settlers long ago. It still works through rare and unknown laws of atoms and electrons. The Roulet family had an unusual link to dark outer spheres. Normal people feel only fear and disgust toward these spheres. Their recroded history seems to prove this. Did the riots in the 1730s start patterns in a sick mind? This mind belonged to one or more of them, like the sinister Paul Roulet. Did these patterns survive the death of the body? Did they continue in a space with many dimensions? They followed lines of force from a strong hatred of the growing community. New science includes relativity and atomic action. This makes such a thing not impossible.\n###\nIn short, it seemed to my wife and me that an incontrovertible array of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the humming toaster; traceable to one or another of the ill-favoured adjustments of two breakfasts before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of thermal and electrical motion.

There was much more than I could remember, but even what I did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever I dared write it down. Some frightful influence, I felt, was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnamable abysses of blackness and alienage; and the process told heavily on me. My health and appearance grew steadily worse, till finally I was forced to give up my position and adopt the static, secluded life of an invalid."}

We could no longer expect dust tracks. We moved forwrad again. We shone a torch on the tunnel walls. We stopped in surprise. The carvings had changed completely in this part. We knew the Old Ones' sculpture had declined. We saw the poorer work in the sections behind us.\n###\nSomething about this whole mechanism, with its polished and almost glistening casing, struck me as more vaguely baffling and irksome than any of the domestic inconveniences I had previously encountered. The regularity of the numerals immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion of minute-indications there, prevented all confusion as to the right setting amidst this plethora of equally identical control-dials. Nevertheless I resolved to resume my instruction manual-referencing if any further complexity should develop; for intuitive methods, of course, could no longer be expected.

With the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific tremendous events began. Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet that was not the worst misfortune. Another race-a land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably corresponding to the fabulous pre-human spawn of Cthulhu-soon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the Old Ones wholly back to the sea-a colossal blow in view of the increasing land settlements.

Immediately afterward an utterly soothing warmth welled forth from the unseen stack, calming and pleasing the diligent folder, and almost relaxing those in the room. At the same time the air stirred with a vibration as of settling cloth, and a sudden cross-breeze more gentle than any previous draft lifted the corners and ruffled the folded edges of the pile. Nothing definite could be seen in the lampless room, though some squinting observers thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of pristine whiteness against the shadowy wall\u2014something like a formless heap of fluff that settled with deliberate slowness toward the final, neat rectangle."}

Second, can separated body parts stay connected? This research needed much fresh human flesh. That is why Herbert West joined the Great War. A terrible thing happened at midnight in March, 1915. It was at a field hospital in St. Eloi. I still wonder if it was a bad dream. West had a private lab in an east room. He said he was finding new treatments for injuries.\n###\nTwo biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle-first, whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain, proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve-centres; and second, whether any kind of ethereal, intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism. All this research work required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh-and that was why Herbert West had entered the Great War. The phantasmal, unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in March, 1915, in a field hospital behind the lines at St. Eloi. I wonder even now if it could have been other than a daemoniac dream of delirium. West had a private laboratory in an east room of the barn-like temporary edifice, assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming."}

Norrys\u2019 family during the restoration of the priory. For five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity, my time being spent mostly in the codification of old family data. I had now obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and flight of Walter de la Poer, which I conceived to be the probable contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at Carfax. It appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having killed all the other members of his household, except four servant confederates, in their sleep, about two weeks after a shocking discovery which changed his whole demeanour, but which, except by implication, he disclosed to no one save perhaps the servants who assisted him and afterward fled beyond reach."}

I shall not be called upon to make any trip outside just yet, though I shall probably wish to do so later on-employing special means and transcending everything which we have hitherto been accustomed to regard as human experience. My house will be besieged no longer. Everything has reverted to normal, and the dogs will have no further occupation. In place of terror I have been given a rich boon of knowledge and intellectual adventure which few other mortals have ever shared. The Outer Beings are perhaps the most marvellous organic things in or beyond all space and time-members of a cosmos-wide race of which all other life-forms are merely degenerate variants."}

This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper."}
