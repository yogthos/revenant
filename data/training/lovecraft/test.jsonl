The dream - filled [THING] lowered itself to the lonely watcher 's [THING]. It mixed with the thick air of his [THING]. It made him part of its incredible marvel. Wild rivers of violet midnight came to that [THING]. They sparkled with golden dust. Swirls of dust and [THING] came from the farthest reaches of space. They were heavy with perfumes from beyond known worlds. Opiate ocaens flowed there. They were lit by suns no [HTING] can ever see. Their whirlpools held strange dolphins and [THING] - nymphs from forgotten depths. Noiseless infinity swirled around the dreamer. It carried him away without even touching his [THING]. His [THING] stayed stiffly leaning from the lonely [THING]. For days not counted on any human calendar, the tides of distant spheres gently carried him. They took him to join the dreams he desired. They were the dremas that men have lost. After many cycles, they softly left him sleeping. He slept on a green shore at sunrise. The green shore smelled of lotus flowers. It was dotted with red [THING] hyacinths. In my tormented ears, a nightmare sound nveer stops. It is a whirring and flapping sound. There is also a fain,t far - off howling like some giant hound. This is not a dream. I fear it is not even madness. Too much has already happened to let me have those merciful doubts. St. John is a torn and mutilated [THING]. I alone know why. My knowledge is such that I am about to shoot myself. I fear I will be torn apart in the same way. Down unlit and endless hallways of strange fantasy are swept by black, formless Nemeiss. This force drives me to destroy myself. May heaven forgive the foolishness. Sickness that led us both to such a monstrous fate! Wearied with the dullness of an ordinary world, where even joys of romance. Adventure soon become boring, St. John and I eagerly followed every artistic and intellectual trend. We sought relief from our crushing boredom. The mysteries of the Symbolists. The intense joys of the pre - Raphaelites were all ours for a time. But each new interest lost its novelty and appeal too quickly. Onyl the dark philosophy of the Decadents could keep our attention. We found it powerful only by slowly increasing the depth and evil of our explorations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon used up of their excitement. Finally, only the more direct stimulation of unnatural personal experiences and adventures remained for us.\n###\nAnd one night a mighty gulf was bridged, and the dream-haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher\u2019s window to merge with the close air of his room and make him a part of their fabulous wonder. There came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold; vortices of dust and fire, swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy with perfumes from beyond the worlds. Opiate oceans poured there, litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and sea-nymphs of unrememberable deeps. Noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men\u2019s calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed; the dreams that men have lost. And in the course of many cycles they tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore; a green shore fragrant with lotus-blossoms and starred by red camalotes. In my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and flapping, and a faint, distant baying as of some gigantic hound. It is not dream\u2014it is not, I fear, even madness\u2014for too much has already happened to give me these merciful doubts. St. John is a mangled corpse; I alone know why, and such is my knowledge that I am about to blow out my brains for fear I shall be mangled in the same way. Down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldritch phantasy sweeps the black, shapeless Nemesis that drives me to self-annihilation. May heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so monstrous a fate! Wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world, where even the joys of romance and adventure soon grow stale, St. John and I had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui. The enigmas of the Symbolists and the ecstasies of the pre-Raphaelites all were ours in their time, but each new mood was drained too soon of its diverting novelty and appeal. Only the sombre philosophy of the Decadents could hold us, and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills, till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures."}

A careful examination of the Necronomicon, in the areas Wilbur had eagerly searched, appeared to provide new. These clues concerned the nature, methods. Desires of the starnge evil vaguely threatening the world. Talks consulted with several students of ancient knowledge in Boston. He also wrote letters to many others in different places. These actions caused his growing amazement. This feeling slowly changed through various levels of alarm. It finally became a state of very sharp spiritual fear. As summer approached, he vaguely felt something should be done. This concerned the hidden terrors in the upper Miskatonic valley. It also concerned the monstrous being known to [THING] as Wilbur Whateley. The Dunwich horror itself occurred between Lammas and the equinox in 1928. Dr. Armitage was one of the [THING] who saw its monstrous beginning. He had also heard about Whateley 's bziarre journey to Cambridge. He heard of Whateley 's desperate attempts to borrow. Copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those attempts had failed. Armitage had sent warnings of the strongest kind to all librarians in charge of the feared [THING]. Wilbur had been very nervous at Cambridge. He was anxious to get the [THING]. Yet he was almost equally anxious to return home. He acted as if he feared the consequences of being away for too long. Early in August, the partly anticipated result happened. In the early morning of the 3rd, Dr. Armitage was suddenly awakened. The wild, fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus woke him. Deep and terrible, the snarling, half - mad growls and barks continued. They always grew louder. But they had hideously significant pauses. Then a scream rang out from a completely different throat. This scream woke half the sleepers of Arkham. It haunted their dreams forever after. Such a scream could not come from any being born of [THING]. Entirely of [THING]. Armitage hurriedly put on some clothes. He rushed across the [THING] and lawn to the college buildings. He saw that others had arrived before him. He heard the echoes of a burglar - alarm still ringing from the library. An open [THING] showed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had indeed finished entering. The barking and the screaming were now fading fast. They became a mixed low growling and moaning. These sounds clearly came from inside the [THING]. Some instinct warned Armitage that the event happening was not for unprepared eyes to see. So he pushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule [THING].\n###\nA visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley. The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and Dr. Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue. He had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley\u2019s grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long. Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small hours of the 3d Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and terrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always in mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throat\u2014such a scream as roused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterward\u2014such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or wholly of earth. Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library. An open window shewed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door."}

It carried them up into layers of the atmosphere. Those layers are inhabited by ghosts that flyers have lived to whisper about after crashes. Looking at them, I thought of carved hints. They hinted at what the river had washed down into the city from their slopes. I wondered how sense. How foolishness had been in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them. I remembered how their end must come near the coast at Queen Mary Land. at that moment, Sir Douglas Mawson 's expedition was working than a thousand miles. I hoped no fate would let Sir Douglas. His men see what might lie beyond the protecting mountains. thoughts showed how I was at the time. Danforth seemed to be. before we passed the star - shaped ruin. Reached our plane, our fears had shifted. We feared the but range we had to cross. From these foothills, the, runi - covered slopes rose and against the east. They reminded us of those paintings of Nicholas Roerich. When we thought of the honeycombs inside them. Of the beings that might have pushed their, squirming way to the peaks, we could not face the idea of sailing past those suggestive cave mouths in the sky without panic. The wind made sounds like an piping over a area. To make things, we saw signs of mist around of the summits. Poor Lake must have seen this when he made that mistake about volcanoes. We thought, shivering, of that mist we had escaped. We thought of that. Of the, horror - spreading place where all vapors came from. The plane was. We put on our flying furs. Danforth started the engine without trouble. We took off over the nightmare city. Below us, the stonework spread out as it had when we saw it. That was, yet, a time. We began rising. Turning to test the wind for our crossing through the mountain pass.\n###\nTheir height, then, must have been tremendous beyond all known comparison\u2014carrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata peopled by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper of after unexplainable falls. Looking at them, I thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their accursed slopes\u2014and wondered how much sense and how much folly had lain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently. I recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at Queen Mary Land, where even at that moment Sir Douglas Mawson\u2019s expedition was doubtless working less than a thousand miles away; and hoped that no evil fate would give Sir Douglas and his men a glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal range. Such thoughts formed a measure of my overwrought condition at the time\u2014and Danforth seemed to be even worse. Yet long before we had passed the great star-shaped ruin and reached our plane our fears had become transferred to the lesser but vast enough range whose re-crossing lay ahead of us. From these foothills the black, ruin-crusted slopes reared up starkly and hideously against the east, again reminding us of those strange Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich; and when we thought of the damnable honeycombs inside them, and of the frightful amorphous entities that might have pushed their foetidly squirming way even to the topmost hollow pinnacles, we could not face without panic the prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave-mouths where the wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range. To make matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the summits\u2014as poor Lake must have done when he made that early mistake about volcanism\u2014and thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just escaped; of that, and of the blasphemous, horror-fostering abyss whence all such vapours came. All was well with the plane, and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs. Danforth got the engine started without trouble, and we made a very smooth takeoff over the nightmare city. Below us the primal Cyclopean masonry spread out as it had done when first we saw it\u2014so short, yet infinitely long, a time ago\u2014and we began rising and turning to test the wind for our crossing through the pass."}

This draft had spread through a crawlspace about five feet above the current insulation level. These smells were level with rooms on the upper floor. In this case, one room still remained. The air we met was a series of clear layers on our left side facing north. Across the crawlspace, where the other bad smell gaped, was an old trunk. It had no keyhole and a strange bulge about ten feet above the opening. It was very dark inside.

The atmosphere thus encountered was a series of palpable layers on our left facing northward.

It was profoundly dark inside, and the opening seemed to exhale a breath of illimitable decay."}

It was in complete darkness. It was nearly impossible because the steps were monstrously big. They were made for gugs. So they were almost a yard high. Carter could not make a good guess of their number. He became very tired very soon. The never - tiring and flexible ghouls had to help him. During the whole endless climb, there was a hidden danger. The danger was of being found and chased. No gug dares lift the [THING] [THING] to the [THING]. This is because of the Great Ones ' curse. But there are no such rules for the tower and the steps. Escaped ghasts are often chased all the way to the top. The ears of gugs are very sharp. The bare feet and hands of the climbers could be heard easily. This would happen when the [THING] woke up. It would take only a little time for the striding giants. They are used to hunting ghasts in the vaults of Zin. They are used to seeing without light. They would catch their smaller, slower prey on those Cyclopean setps. It was very discouraging to think about. The silent chasing gugs would not be heard at all. They would appear very suddenly and shockingly in the dark. They would appear right upon the climbers. Nor the traditional fear gugs have for ghouls could be trusted. This was especially true in that strange palce. The advantages were so strongly with the gugs. There was also some danger from the sneaky, poisonous ghasts. They often hopped up into the tower. They did this during the sleep hour of the gugs. If the gugs slept long. The ghasts came back soon from their job in the cave, the smell of the climbers might be found easily. Those disgusting and unfriendly things might find it. In that case, it would almost be better to be eaten by a ggu. Then, after ages of climbing, a cough came from the darkness above. Things took a very serious and surprising turn. It was clear that a ghats, or maybe more, had wandered into that tower. This happened before Carter and his guides cam.e It was also clear that this danger was very near. After a second without breathing, the lead ghoul pushed Carter to the [THING]. He placed his two relatives in the best positions. He raised the old slate tombstone. It was ready for a powerful hit. This would happen whenever the enemy came into view. Ghouls can see in the dark. The group was not in as bad a situation as Carter would have been alone.\n###\nThere now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness; made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps, which were fashioned for gugs, and were therefore nearly a yard high. Of their number Carter could form no just estimate, for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him. All through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the Great Ones\u2019 curse, there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps, and escaped ghasts are often chased even to the very top. So sharp are the ears of gugs, that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke; and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants, accustomed from their ghast-hunts in the vaults of Zin to seeing without light, to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those Cyclopean steps. It was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all, but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers. Nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs. There was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts, which frequently hopped up into the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs. If the gugs slept long, and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern, the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and ill-disposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gug. Then, after aeons of climbing, there came a cough from the darkness above; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn. It was clear that a ghast, or perhaps even more, had strayed into that tower before the coming of Carter and his guides; and it was equally clear that this peril was very close. After a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed Carter to the wall and arranged his two kinsfolk in the best possible way, with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight. Ghouls can see in the dark, so the party was not as badly off as Carter would have been alone."}

And when the red Aldebaran had crawled more than half way around the horizon, there were again darkness and silence. When I awaked, I was not as I had been. Upon my memory was graven the vision of the city, and within my soul had arisen another and vaguer recollection, of whose nature I was not then certain. Thereafter, on the cloudy nights when I could sleep, I saw the city often; sometimes under that horned waning moon, and sometimes under the hot yellow rays of a sun which did not set, but which wheeled low around the horizon. And on the clear nights the Pole Star leered as never before. Gradually I came to wonder what might be my place in that city on the strange plateau betwixt strange peaks. At first content to view the scene as an all-observant uncorporeal presence, I now desired to define my relation to it, and to speak my mind amongst the grave men who conversed each day in the public squares. I said to myself, \u201cThis is no dream, for by what means can I prove the greater reality of that other life in the house of stone and brick south of the sinister swamp and the cemetery on the low hillock, where the Pole Star peers into my north window each night?\u201d One night as I listened to the discourse in the large square containing many statues, I felt a change; and perceived that I had at last a bodily form. Nor was I a stranger in the streets of Olatho\u00eb, which lies on the plateau of Sarkis, betwixt the peaks Noton and Kadiphonek. It was my friend Alos who spoke, and his speech was one that pleased my soul, for it was the speech of a true man and patriot. That night had the news come of Daikos\u2019 fall, and of the advance of the Inutos; squat, hellish, yellow fiends who five years ago had appeared out of the unknown west to ravage the confines of our kingdom, and finally to besiege our towns. Having taken the fortified places at the foot of the mountains, their way now lay open to the plateau, unless every citizen could resist with the strength of ten men."}

That man from centuries and forbidden secrets troubled the world. The madness from beyond time had ended. The case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Before closing his eyes and staggering from that room, Dr. Willett saw that his memory had been. As he had predicted, there had been no need for acids. Like his picture a year, Joseph Curwen lay scattered on the floor. It was a layer of - dust. In the region of Arkham, the hills rise. There are valleys with woods that no axe has cut. There are, glesn where the trees lean in ways. streams trickle, catching the sunlight. On the slopes there are farms. They are and, with, moss - covered cottages. These cottages seem to brood over New England secrets, sheltered by ledges. But these are. The chimneys are crumbling. The walls bulge beneath gambrel roofs. The people have moved. Foreigners do not like to live. French - Canadians have tried it. Italians have tried it. The Poles have come and gone. It is not because of anything you can see, hear, or touch. It is because of something that is imagined. The place is not for the imagination. It does not bring dreams at night. This must be whta keeps foreigners.

People stopped using it. A road was built, curving to the south. Traces of the road can be found in the weeds of the returning wilderness. Some traces will remain when half the hollows are flooded for the reservoir. the woods will be cut down. The heath will sleep below waters. The water 's surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun.\n###\nBut he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again.

For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust. West of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the glint of sunlight. On the gentler slopes there are farms, ancient and rocky, with squat, moss-coated cottages brooding eternally over old New England secrets in the lee of great ledges; but these are all vacant now, the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs. The old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there. French-Canadians have tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles have come and departed. It is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled, but because of something that is imagined. The place is not good for the imagination, and does not bring restful dreams at night. It must be this which keeps the foreigners away, for old Ammi Pierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the strange days. Ammi, whose head has been a little queer for years, is the only one who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days; and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads around Arkham. There was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran straight where the blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it and a new road was laid curving far toward the south. Traces of the old one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness, and some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are flooded for the new reservoir. Then the dark woods will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun."}

Edward meant to marry Asenath, and had even been looking at houses in the suburbs. Knowing my usually great influence with his son, the father wondered if I could help to break the ill-advised affair off; but I regretfully expressed my doubts. This time it was not a question of Edward\u2019s weak will but of the woman\u2019s strong will. The perennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image to a new and stronger image, and nothing could be done about it. The wedding was performed a month later\u2014by a justice of the peace, according to the bride\u2019s request. Mr. Derby, at my advice, offered no opposition; and he, my wife, my son, and I attended the brief ceremony\u2014the other guests being wild young people from the college. Asenath had bought the old Crowninshield place in the country at the end of High Street, and they proposed to settle there after a short trip to Innsmouth, whence three servants and some books and household goods were to be brought. It was probably not so much consideration for Edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college, its library, and its crowd of \u201csophisticates\u201d, that made Asenath settle in Arkham instead of returning permanently home. When Edward called on me after the honeymoon I thought he looked slightly changed. Asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped moustache, but there was more than that. He looked soberer and more thoughtful, his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being exchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness. I was puzzled to decide whether I liked or disliked the change. Certainly, he seemed for the moment more normally adult than ever before. Perhaps the marriage was a good thing\u2014might not the change of dependence form a start toward actual neutralisation, leading ultimately to responsible independence? He came alone, for Asenath was very busy. She had brought a vast store of books and apparatus from Innsmouth (Derby shuddered as he spoke the name), and was finishing the restoration of the Crowninshield house and grounds. Her home in\u2014that town\u2014was a rather disquieting place, but certain objects in it had taught him some surprising things. He was progressing fast in esoteric lore now that he had Asenath\u2019s guidance. Some of the experiments she proposed were very daring and radical\u2014he did not feel at liberty to describe them\u2014but he had confidence in her powers and intentions."}

I now cautiously entered the dark study, where I expected to find Akeley, whether asleep or awake, in the great corner chair which was evidently his favourite resting-place.

Looking back at that moment, I can only regret my timidity and wish that I had boldly caused the apparatus to speak. God knows what mysteries and horrible doubts and questions of identity it might have cleared up! But then, it may be merciful that I let it alone. From the table I turned my flashlight to the corner where I thought Akeley was, but found to my perplexity that the great easy-chair was empty of any human occupant asleep or awake. From the seat to the floor there trailed voluminously the familiar old dressing-gown, and near it on the floor lay the yellow scarf and the huge foot-bandages I had thought so odd. As I hesitated, striving to conjecture where Akeley might be, and why he had so suddenly discarded his necessary sick-room garments, I observed that the queer odour and sense of vibration were no longer in the room."}

Male and female demons howled praise to him. Headless monsters cried out to the false god. Creatures jumped to the sound of thin, cursed flutes. Goat-men chased endlessly after misshapen forest spirits. They chased over rocks that looked like swollen toads. Fear and madness were not missing. In this purest form of all damnation, the limits of awareness were loewred. Man's imagination lay open to views of every kingdom of horror. It lay open to every forbidden place that evil had the powre to shape. The world and its gods wree powerless against such attacks. These attacks came from opened wells of night. No sign or prayer could stop the wild party of horror. That horror had come when a wise man with the hateful key had found group. That group had the locked and full chest of passed-down demon knowledge. Suddenly a ray of physical light shot through these visions. He headr the sound of oars. He heard it amidst the curses of things that should be dead. A boat with a lantern at its front shot into view. It tied to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier. It threw up several dark men. They carried a long object wrapped in bedding. They took it to the naked gloiwng thing on the carved golden base. The thing giggled and touched the bedding. Then they unwrapped it. They stood up in front of the bsae the rotting body of a fat old man. He had a stubbly beard and messy white hair. The glowing thing giggled again. The men took btotles from their pockets. They rubbed its feet with red liquid. Then they gave the bottles to the thing to drink from. All at once, from a covered path leading away forever, came the devilish rattle. Wheeze of a cursed organ. It choked and rumbled out the mockeries of hell. It did so in a cracked, mocking low voice. In an instant, every moving being was shocked into action. They formed at once into a formal line. The nightmare crowd slid away. They went to find the suond. There were goats, satyrs, and goat-men. There were male demons, female demons, and ghosts. There were twisted toads and shapeless basic things. There were dog-faced howlers and silent walkers in darkness. All were led by the horrible naked glowing thing. That thing had squatted on the carved golden throne. Now it walked boldly. It carried in its arms the glassy-eyed body of the fat old man. The strange dark men danced at the back. The whole line skipped and jumped with wild anger. He stumbled after them a few steps. He was delirious and confused. He was unsure of his place in this world or any wolrd.\n###\nIncubi and succubae howled praise to Hecate, and headless moon-calves bleated to the Magna Mater. Goats leaped to the sound of thin accursed flutes, and aegipans chased endlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks twisted like swollen toads. Moloch and Ashtaroth were not absent; for in this quintessence of all damnation the bounds of consciousness were let down, and man\u2019s fancy lay open to vistas of every realm of horror and every forbidden dimension that evil had power to mould. The world and Nature were helpless against such assaults from unsealed wells of night, nor could any sign or prayer check the Walpurgis-riot of horror which had come when a sage with the hateful key had stumbled on a horde with the locked and brimming coffer of transmitted daemon-lore. Suddenly a ray of physical light shot through these phantasms, and Malone heard the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of things that should be dead. A boat with a lantern in its prow darted into sight, made fast to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier, and vomited forth several dark men bearing a long burden swathed in bedding. They took it to the naked phosphorescent thing on the carved golden pedestal, and the thing tittered and pawed at the bedding. Then they unswathed it, and propped upright before the pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a corpulent old man with stubbly beard and unkempt white hair. The phosphorescent thing tittered again, and the men produced bottles from their pockets and anointed its feet with red, whilst they afterward gave the bottles to the thing to drink from. All at once, from an arcaded avenue leading endlessly away, there came the daemoniac rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ, choking and rumbling out the mockeries of hell in a cracked, sardonic bass. In an instant every moving entity was electrified; and forming at once into a ceremonial procession, the nightmare horde slithered away in quest of the sound\u2014goat, satyr, and aegipan, incubus, succuba, and lemur, twisted toad and shapeless elemental, dog-faced howler and silent strutter in darkness\u2014all led by the abominable naked phosphorescent thing that had squatted on the carved golden throne, and that now strode insolently bearing in its arms the glassy-eyed corpse of the corpulent old man. The strange dark men danced in the rear, and the whole column skipped and leaped with Dionysiac fury. Malone staggered after them a few steps, delirious and hazy, and doubtful of his place in this or in any world."}

At Reaching, I removed one of the thicker examples with some trouble. Placed it on the desk to check. It was marked in the common official writing, though something about the order of the numbers seemed slightly odd. The strange working of the brass fastener was perfectly known to me. I opened the still-strong and working clasp and took out the papers inside. Those, as expected, were about eleven by eight inches in size. Almost an inch thick. Cardboard dividers separated the parts. Their pulpy, wood-fiber pages seemed untouched by many cycles of budget years they had lived through. I studied the oddly printed, machine-stamped numbers of the record boko. These symbols were completely unlike either the usual rounded numbers. Any math known to common sense. I felt a haunting, partly awakened memory. It came to me that this was the code used by a trapped clerk I had known a little in my dreams.

We had not lived there for a week when we got a body on the very night it was buried. We made it open its eyes with a rather reasonable look before the liquid stopped working. It was missing an arm. If it had been a complete body we might have done better. Between that time and the next January, we got three more bodies. One was a complete failure. One showed clear muscle movement. One was a rather shaky thing. It got up by itself and made a noise. Then came a time when our luck was Burials became fewer. Those that did happen were of bodies either too sick. Too damaged for our use. We recorded all the deaths and their details with careful order. We got a body that did not come from the public burial ground. In Bolton the common feeling in Puritanism had made the sport of boxing illegal. This had the usual result. Surreptitious and poorly managed fights among the factory workers were common. Sometimes low-level professional fighters were brought in. This late winter night there had been such a fight. Clearly it had results, because two fearful Poles came to us. They whispered requests in a confused way for us to help with a very secret. We went with them to an barn. There, the last of a group of scared foreigners were watching a silent black shape on the floor. The fight had been between Kid O\u2019Brien, a clumsy. Now shaking man with a veyr un-Irish hooked nose. Buck Robinson, \u201cThe Harlem Smoke\u201d. The black man had been knocked out. A check showed us he would stay that way forever. He was a disgusting, ape-like thing. He had very arms that I could not help calling front legs. His face made one think of Congo secrets. Drum beats under a moon. The body must have looked even worse when alive. But the world holds many things. Fear was on the whole sad crowd. They did not know what the law would demand from them if the matter was not kept They were thankful when West, even though I shook without wanting to, offered to remove the thing quietly. He had a purpose I knew very well. Bright moonlight shone on the land without snow. We covered the thing. Carried it home together through the streets. We had carried a similar thing one night in Arkham.\n###\nWe had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial, and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed. It had lost an arm\u2014if it had been a perfect body we might have succeeded better. Between then and the next January we secured three more; one total failure, one case of marked muscular motion, and one rather shivery thing\u2014it rose of itself and uttered a sound. Then came a period when luck was poor; interments fell off, and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use. We kept track of all the deaths and their circumstances with systematic care. One March night, however, we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not come from the potter\u2019s field. In Bolton the prevailing spirit of Puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxing\u2014with the usual result. Surreptitious and ill-conducted bouts among the mill-workers were common, and occasionally professional talent of low grade was imported. This late winter night there had been such a match; evidently with disastrous results, since two timorous Poles had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret and desperate case. We followed them to an abandoned barn, where the remnants of a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form on the floor. The match had been between Kid O\u2019Brien\u2014a lubberly and now quaking youth with a most un-Hibernian hooked nose\u2014and Buck Robinson, \u201cThe Harlem Smoke\u201d. The negro had been knocked out, and a moment\u2019s examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so. He was a loathsome, gorilla-like thing, with abnormally long arms which I could not help calling fore legs, and a face that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable Congo secrets and tom-tom poundings under an eerie moon. The body must have looked even worse in life\u2014but the world holds many ugly things. Fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd, for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up; and they were grateful when West, in spite of my involuntary shudders, offered to get rid of the thing quietly\u2014for a purpose I knew too well. There was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape, but we dressed the thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows, as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in Arkham."}

I could not forget the young, beautiful [THING] with its leaf crown. I am not an artist by nature. I was also sorry I had no one to talk to. Klenze, though not my mental equal, was much better than no one. I did not sleep well that night. I wondered exactly when the end would come. Surely, I had very little chance of rescue. The next day, I went up to the tower. I began the usual searchlight inspections. Northward the view was much the same as the past four days. We had seen the bottom for four days.

I could not forget the youthful, beautiful head with its leafy crown, though I am not by nature an artist. I was also sorry that I had no one with whom to converse. Klenze, though not my mental equal, was much better than no one. I did not sleep well that night, and wondered exactly when the end would come. Surely, I had little enough chance of rescue. The next day I ascended to the conning tower and commenced the customary searchlight explorations. Northward the view was much the same as it had been all the four days since we had sighted the bottom, but I perceived that the drifting of the U-29 was less rapid. As I swung the beam around to the south, I noticed that the ocean floor ahead fell away in a marked declivity, and bore curiously regular blocks of stone in certain places, disposed as if in accordance with definite patterns. The boat did not at once descend to match the greater ocean depth, so I was soon forced to adjust the searchlight to cast a sharply downward beam. Owing to the abruptness of the change a wire was disconnected, which necessitated a delay of many minutes for repairs; but at length the light streamed on again, flooding the marine valley below me. I am not given to emotion of any kind, but my amazement was very great when I saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow. And yet as one reared in the best Kultur of Prussia I should not have been amazed, for geology and tradition alike tell us of great transpositions in oceanic and continental areas. What I saw was an extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices; all of magnificent though unclassified architecture, and in various stages of preservation. Most appeared to be of marble, gleaming whitely in the rays of the searchlight, and the general plan was of a large city at the bottom of a narrow valley, with numerous isolated temples and villas on the steep slopes above. Roofs were fallen and columns were broken, but there still remained an air of immemorially ancient splendour which nothing could efface. Confronted at last with the Atlantis I had formerly deemed largely a myth, I was the most eager of explorers."}

You know more than I do about who or what wrote that small message. But I must warn you it was not written for no reason. There are terrible and offensive things that must be destroyed. I believe the [THING] who wrote those words will deal with Oren and Hutchinson. One of those beings once wrote to you, ' do not summon anything you can not control '. You were destroyed once before, maybe in exactly that way. It could be that your own dark magic will destroy you all again. Curwen, a [THING] can not interfere with Nature beyond certain points. Every horror you have created will rise up to erase you. \". Here the doctor was interrupted by a sudden, violent cry from the being in front of him. Hopelessly was trapped, without a [THING]. He knew any physical attack would bring many helpers to save the doctor. So Joseph Curwen turned to his one old ally. He started a series of mystical [THING] movements wiht his index fingers. His deep, hollow voice, no longer pretending to be rough, shouted out the first words of a dreadful spell. But Willett was faster than him. Just as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl. Just as a cold [THING] suddenly blew from the bay, the doctor started the serious. Steady speaking of what he had planned to say all along. An [THING] for an eyelet the result show how well the lesson of the deep void had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of those two spells. The first one had summoned the writer of that small writing. This was the mysterious call whose title was the Dragon 's Tail, the sign of the descending node. At the very first word from Willett 's mouth, the spell the patient had started stopped completely. Unable to speak, the monster made frantic motions with his arms until they also stopped. When the terrible name Yog - Sothoth was spoken, the horrible change began. It was not just a dissolving, but more a changing or a repeating of form. Willett closed his eyes. He would not faint before the rest of the chant could be said. But he did not faint. That [THING] of unholy centuries and foribdden secrets never bothered the world again. The madness from beyond time had clamed down. The case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed.\n###\nYou know better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, \u2018do not call up any that you can not put down\u2019. You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man can\u2019t tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out.\u201d But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctor\u2019s rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula. But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye\u2014magic for magic\u2014let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules\u2014the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragon\u2019s Tail, sign of the descending node\u2014 At the very first word from Willett\u2019s mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced. But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed."}

Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue, but the little that was achieved left us all awed and bewildered. Existing biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing was no product of any cell-growth science knows about. There had been scarcely any mineral replacement, and despite an age of perhaps forty million years the internal organs were wholly intact. The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing\u2019s form of organisation; and pertained to some palaeogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation. At first all that Lake found was dry, but as the heated tent produced its thawing effect, organic moisture of pungent and offensive odour was encountered toward the thing\u2019s uninjured side. It was not blood, but a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose. By the time Lake reached this stage all 37 dogs had been brought to the still uncompleted corral near the camp; and even at that distance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid, diffusive smell. Far from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional dissection merely deepened its mystery. All guesses about its external members had been correct, and on the evidence of these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal; but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that Lake was left hopelessly at sea. It had digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste matter through the reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one would say that its respiratory apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon dioxide; and there were odd evidences of air-storage chambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathing-systems\u2014gills and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian and probably adapted to long airless hibernation-periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present in connexion with the main respiratory system, but they presented anomalies beyond immediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable-utterance, seemed barely conceivable; but musical piping notes covering a wide range were highly probable. The muscular system was almost preternaturally developed. The nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave Lake aghast. Though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects, the thing had a set of ganglial centres and connectives arguing the very extremes of specialised development."}

He wrote and studied in a moldy attic gable that felt unholy. He wrestled with figures. Formulas when he was not lying on his thin iron bed. His hearing became unnaturally and painfully shar.p He had stopped the cheap clock on the mantel long ago. Its ticking had started to sound like loud artillery to him. At night, the quiet movements of dark [THING] outside bothered him. The evil sound of rats in the walls. The creaking of old [THING] in the [THING] felt like a loud chaos to him. The darkness was always full of sounds he could not explain. Yet he sometimes shook with fear that those noises would stop. He feared that if they stopped, he would hear other, quieter noises hiding behind them. He was in the old [THING] of Arkham. Its legends never changed. The roofs with two slopes clustered together. They swayed and sagged over attics. Witches hid in those attics from the King 's men in the old, dark days of the Province. In that whole [THING], Nor was a place filled with more dark memories than his attic [THING]. This was because this saem [THING] and [THING] had also sheltered old Keziah Mason long ago. No one could ever explain his final escape from Salem Gaol. That happened in 1692. The jailer went mad. He talked about a tiny, furry thing with white fangs. It ran out of Keziah 's cell. Not even Cotton Mather could explain the marks on the grey [THING] walls. The marks were curves and angles. They were smeared with a red, sticky fluid. Possibly Gilman should not have studied so hard. Non - Euclidean calculus and quantum physics are hard for any mind. Mixing them with folklore makes it worse. Trying to find a strange, multi - dimensional truth behind the horror of the Gothic tales. The wild stories told by the fireplace is difficult. One can not expect to be free from mental strain from that. Gilman came from Haverhill. Only after starting college in Arkham did he link his math to the old legends of magic. The atmosphere of the ancient [THING] worked on his mind in unclear ways. The professors at Miskatonic told him to rest more. Tehy reduced his course load in several areas. They also stopped him from reading certain old books. Those books were about forbidden secrest. They were kept locked in a vault in the university library.\n###\nBehind everything crouched the brooding, festering horror of the ancient town, and of the mouldy, unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed. His ears were growing sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable degree, and he had long ago stopped the cheap mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery. At night the subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house, were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium. The darkness always teemed with unexplained sound\u2014and yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other, fainter, noises which he suspected were lurking behind them. He was in the changeless, legend-haunted city of Arkham, with its clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the King\u2019s men in the dark, olden days of the Province. Nor was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured him\u2014for it was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old Keziah Mason, whose flight from Salem Gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain. That was in 1692\u2014the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small, white-fanged furry thing which scuttled out of Keziah\u2019s cell, and not even Cotton Mather could explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red, sticky fluid. Possibly Gilman ought not to have studied so hard. Non-Euclidean calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain; and when one mixes them with folklore, and tries to trace a strange background of multi-dimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the Gothic tales and the wild whispers of the chimney-corner, one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension. Gilman came from Haverhill, but it was only after he had entered college in Arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder magic. Something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his imagination. The professors at Miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points.

I imagined to myself all the glories of a time. Far away that Chaldaea could not remember it. I thought of Sarnath the Doomed, which stood in the land of Mnar when humans were young. I thought of Ib, which was carved from grey stone before humans existed. Suddenly I found a place where the solid rock rose bare through the sand. Made a low cliff. Here I saw with happiness what seemed to promise more signs of the ancient people. Cut roughly on the cliff face were the clear fronts of several small, wide rock houses. Their insides might keep many secrets of ages too old to count, though sandstorms had long ago erased any carvings that may have been outside. All the dark openings near me were low and filled with sand. I cleared one with my shovel and crawled through it. I carried a torch to show whatever mysteries it might hold. Inside I saw that the cave was indeed a temple. I saw clear signs of the people who had lived. Worshipped there before the desert was desert. There were altars, pillars, and spaces in the walls, all strangely low. I saw no statues or wlal paintings. But there were many unusual stones clearly shaped into symbols by human hands. The carved room was very low, so I could hardly do more than kneel upright. But the space was so large that my torch showed only part at a time. I felt a strange shudder in some of the far corners. Certain altars and stones hinted at forgotten ceremonies of a terrible, disgusting, and unexplainable kind. This made me wonder what sort of men could have built. Used such a temple. After seeing all that the place held, I crawled out again. I was eager to find what the other temples might offer. Night had now come near. Yet the real things I had seen made curiosity stronger than fear. I did not run from the lnog shadows made by the moon that had scared me when I first saw the nameless city. In the dim light I cleared another opening. Wiht a new torch I crawled into it. I found more unclear stones. Symbols, though nothing more certain than the other temple had held. The room was just as low, but much less wide. It ended in a very narrow hallway fileld with vague and mysterious shrines.\n###\nTo myself I pictured all the splendours of an age so distant that Chaldaea could not recall it, and thought of Sarnath the Doomed, that stood in the land of Mnar when mankind was young, and of Ib, that was carven of grey stone before mankind existed. All at once I came upon a place where the bed-rock rose stark through the sand and formed a low cliff; and here I saw with joy what seemed to promise further traces of the antediluvian people. Hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small, squat rock houses or temples; whose interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too remote for calculation, though sandstorms had long since effaced any carvings which may have been outside. Very low and sand-choked were all of the dark apertures near me, but I cleared one with my spade and crawled through it, carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold. When I was inside I saw that the cavern was indeed a temple, and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshipped before the desert was a desert. Primitive altars, pillars, and niches, all curiously low, were not absent; and though I saw no sculptures nor frescoes, there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means. The lowness of the chiselled chamber was very strange, for I could hardly more than kneel upright; but the area was so great that my torch shewed only part at a time. I shuddered oddly in some of the far corners; for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible, revolting, and inexplicable nature, and made me wonder what manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple. When I had seen all that the place contained, I crawled out again, avid to find what the other temples might yield. Night had now approached, yet the tangible things I had seen made curiosity stronger than fear, so that I did not flee from the long moon-cast shadows that had daunted me when first I saw the nameless city. In the twilight I cleared another aperture and with a new torch crawled into it, finding more vague stones and symbols, though nothing more definite than the other temple had contained. The room was just as low, but much less broad, ending in a very narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines."}

It is wrong to think that sterility is always linked to emptiness, quiet, and absence. I found it in the bright light of the buzzing lamps. I found it in the constant hum of an air system. I found it in the crowded middle of a plain and ordinary office building. A boring janitor and two uncaring colleagues were with me. That year in autumn, I had gotten some dull. Unprofitable office work in a certain business area. I was forced to travel through its inside passages. I started moving from one unnamed hallway to another. I was looking for a path that had acceptable navigation, bearable air. Very direct travel. It soon became clear I only had a choice between different dull options. But after a while, I found a hallway on the fourth underground level. It bothered me much less than the others I had walked through.\n###\nIt is a mistake to fancy that sterility is associated inextricably with emptiness, silence, and vacancy. I found it in the glare of the humming luminescence, in the ceaseless thrum of a ventilation system, and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace office building with a prosaic janitor and two indifferent colleagues by my side. In the autumn of that year I had secured some dreary and unprofitable clerical duties in a certain commercial quarter; and being compelled to traverse its interior arteries, began drifting from one anonymous corridor to another in search of a passage which might combine the qualities of tolerable navigation, endurable atmosphere, and very direct conveyance. It soon developed that I had only a choice between different monotones, but after a time I came upon a hallway on the fourth sub-level which oppressed me much less than the others I had traversed."}

He asked nearly all the friends he could ask without being rdue. He asked for nightly reports of their dreams. He asked for dates of any notable visions for some time back. The response to his request seems to have been mixed. He msut have gotten more replies than any normal [THING] could handle without a helper. This first set of letters was not kept. But his notes formed a complete and truly important summary. Average [THING] in society and businessgave an almost completely negative result. But here and there were scattered cases of uneasy but shapeless nigth impressions. These always happened between March 23rd and April 2nd. That was the time of young Wilcox 's delirium. Scientific men were little more affected. But four uncelar cases suggest quick glimpses of strange places. In one case, there is mention of a fear of something not normal. The useful answers came from the artists and poets. I know panic would have spread if they had been able to compare notes. As it was, I did not have their original letters. I half suspected the [THING] who put it together of asking leading questions. Or of editing letters to support what he secretly wanted to see. That is why I still felt that Wilcox, somehow aware of the old facts my uncle had, had been tricking the older scientist. These answers from art lovers told a troubling story. From From February 28th to Aprli 2nd, a large number of them had dreamed very odd things. The dreams were much stronger during the time of the sculptor 's delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything reported scenes. Half - sounds not unlike those Wilcox had described. Some dreamers admitted sharp fear of the giant nameless thnig seen near the end. One case, which the note stresses, was very sad. [THING] was a well - known architect interested in theosophy and the occult. He went violently insane on the date young Wilcox got sick. He died several months later after non - stop screaming. He screamed to be saved from some escaped creature from hell. Had my uncle had named these cases instead of just using numbers, I would have tried to check. But as it was, I only managed to find a few.\n###\nMy uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary. This original correspondence was not preserved, but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest. Average people in society and business\u2014New England\u2019s traditional \u201csalt of the earth\u201d\u2014gave an almost completely negative result, though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there, always between March 23d and April 2nd\u2014the period of young Wilcox\u2019s delirium. Scientific men were little more affected, though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes, and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal. It was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came, and I know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor\u2019s delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young Wilcox\u2019s seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few."}

The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings. Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwen\u2019s features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel. Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate."}

It avoided the archways by turning sharply outward onto the open [THING]. It wound up the enormous round [THING] like a sipral. It was like an inside version of ramps that once climbed outside the giant towers. Ziggurats of ancient Babylon. Only our fast flight. The confusing view from above stopped us from seeing this from the air. That made us look for another way down to the level under the ice. Pabodie might have known what engineering held it up. But Danforth and I could only look and wonder. We saw big [THING] supports and pillars here and there. But what we saw did not seem strong enough for the job. The ramp was very well preserved up to the current top of the twoer. This was very surprising given its exposure. Its shelter had helped protect the strange and upsetting space carvings on the walls. We stepped out into the dim half - light of this huge cylinder bottom. It was fifty million yeras old. It was without doubt the oldest structure we had ever seen. We saw the ramp - covered sides stretched up to a height of sixty feet. We remembered from our air survey that this meant about forty feet of ice outside. The wide hole we saw from the plane was at the top of a twenty - foot pile of broken [THING]. This pile was partly sheltered on three sides by the curved walls of higher ruins. According to the carvings, the original tower stood in the middle of a huge round plaza. It was maybe 500 or 600 feet high. It had layers of flat discs near the top. It had a row of thin spires along the upper edge. Most of the stonework had fallen outward, not inward. This was lucky. Otherwise the ramp might have broken and the inside blocked. As it was, the ramp showed bad damage. The blocking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed recently half - cleared. We quickly decided this was the route the others used to go down. This would be the logical route for us to go up. This was despite the long [THING] trail we left elsewhere.\n###\nBut the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which, eluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique Babylon. Only the rapidity of our flight, and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower\u2019s inner wall, had prevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the sub-glacial level. Pabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it in place, but Danforth and I could merely admire and marvel. We could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there, but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing was excellently preserved up to the present top of the tower\u2014a highly remarkable circumstance in view of its exposure\u2014and its shelter had done much to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls. As we stepped out into the awesome half-daylight of this monstrous cylinder-bottom\u2014fifty million years old, and without doubt the most primally ancient structure ever to meet our eyes\u2014we saw that the ramp-traversed sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty feet. This, we recalled from our a\u00ebrial survey, meant an outside glaciation of some forty feet; since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane had been at the top of an approximately twenty-foot mound of crumbled masonry, somewhat sheltered for three-fourths of its circumference by the massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins. According to the sculptures the original tower had stood in the centre of an immense circular plaza; and had been perhaps 500 or 600 feet high, with tiers of horizontal discs near the top, and a row of needle-like spires along the upper rim. Most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inward\u2014a fortunate happening, since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered and the whole interior choked. As it was, the ramp shewed sad battering; whilst the choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently half-cleared. It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere."}

Before I reached the final bundle I could detect a faint and musty odor of mildew behind me, and I presently allowed the dust to settle and take copious dominion from the afternoon sun."}

People must also watch out for a specific hidden mistake. This mistake will never ruin the whole document. But it may casue terrible and unpredictable damage to certain bold sections inside it. For this last reason, I strongly urge giving up all tries to make sense of those pieces of unknown, ancient rules that my study aimed to look into.\n###\nAfter twenty-two years of drudgery and tedium, sustained only by a desperate conviction of the mundane utility of certain tasks, I am unwilling to vouch for the accuracy of that which I think I entered into the corporate ledger on the afternoon of July 17\u201318, 1935. There is reason to hope that my undertaking was wholly or partly an illusion\u2014for which, indeed, abundant precedents existed. And yet, its complexity was so hideous that I sometimes find coherence impossible. If the entries did converge, then man must be prepared to accept notions of the ledger, and of his own place in the seething vortex of data, whose merest calculation is paralysing. He must, too, be placed on guard against a specific lurking error which, though it will never engulf the whole document, may impose monstrous and unguessable corruptions upon certain venturesome cells within it. It is for this latter reason that I urge, with all the force of my being, a final abandonment of all attempts at reconciling those fragments of unknown, primordial formulae which my review set out to investigate."}

This widespread, longl-asting boredom had certainly been caused by the terrible magazines that spread across the dirty. These magazines had once provided a small distraction for the waiting patients. Later, they showed their very old and shocking publication dates. Little gradually, they woer down the weak mental health of those forced to wait. Finally, their annoying repetitions reached deep into the mind. They combined with the still air to create a stronger feeling of hopelessness. Finally their entire material broke into dry yellow page.s This made the old promises of entertainment completely empty. Much of the suffering we now experienced was based on that empty starting point. The caretakers saw what had happened. They performed their rarely used duty to improve the environment. They should get newer and less awful books to put on those huge shelves. This is where the tired eyes start to look down into a feeling of bored fear.\n###\nThis vast, time-worn ennui had undoubtedly been bred by the dreadful periodicals which proliferated upon the unwholesome and tattered tables, and which had formerly offered some meagre distraction to the waiting sufferers before turning at last to reveal their ancient and unspeakable dates. Little by little they had eroded the fragile sanity of those condemned to linger, till at last their maddening repetitions reached the caverns of the mind and joined with the stagnant air in conjuring a deeper despair. Finally their whole substance decayed into brittle yellow leaves and left the old promises of diversion utterly void. Much of the subsequent torment as we now endured it had been built upon that barren foundation. The custodians, perceiving what had transpired, and exercising their seldom-awakened aesthetic duty, should procure more recent and less abhorrent volumes to place upon those cyclopean racks where the weary gaze begins its descent into listless dread."}

We could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was a million or ten million or fifty million years ago, for the sculptures told us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and suburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant Tertiary vegetation had looked like. It must have had a marvellous and mystic beauty, and as I thought of it I almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which the city\u2019s inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and glacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit. Yet according to certain carvings the denizens of that city had themselves known the clutch of oppressive terror; for there was a sombre and recurrent type of scene in which the Old Ones were shewn in the act of recoiling affrightedly from some object\u2014never allowed to appear in the design\u2014found in the great river and indicated as having been washed down through waving, vine-draped cycad-forests from those horrible westward mountains. It was only in the one late-built house with the decadent carvings that we obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the city\u2019s desertion. Undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of the same age elsewhere, even allowing for the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and uncertain period; indeed, very certain evidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward. But this was the first and only set we directly encountered. We meant to look farther later on; but as I have said, immediate conditions dictated another present objective. There would, though, have been a limit\u2014for after all hope of a long future occupancy of the place had perished among the Old Ones, there could not but have been a complete cessation of mural decoration. The ultimate blow, of course, was the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in thrall, and which has never departed from the ill-fated poles\u2014the great cold that, at the world\u2019s other extremity, put an end to the fabled lands of Lomar and Hyperborea. Just when this tendency began in the antarctic it would be hard to say in terms of exact years."}

But the calm customers of the store were also very busy with tiring tasks. The marekt was almost of staff. Every store clerk was helping to direct the rushing crowds. The manager especilaly had shown sacrifice in his service. He used his extreme patience with energy on transactions many others avoided due to complexity. In less than an hour, the brave manager had become a local hero. He did not seem aware of his fame as he fought to keep from falling down from mental tiredness.

Taking took advantage of the confusion in both staff procedures and city shopping hours. One evening, he got a recently bought basket secretly into the self-service area. In front of me, he scanned a version of his produce. The machine actually made its approval sound. Then it glared with a single red of soul-freezing error before going completely silent.

My first childhood fantasies were woven around its twisted oak trees. Well I came to know the tree spirits that ruled there. I often watched their wild dances in the faint light of a fading moon. But I must not speak of these things now. I will only tell of the lonely tomb in the darkest part of the hillside bushes. It is the deserted tomb of the Hydes famliy. This was an old and noble family. Their last direct descendant was placed inside its black space many decades before I was born. The vault I mean is made of old granite. It is worn and stained by generations of mist and damp. It is set back into the hillside. Only entrance is visible. The door is a heavy, threatening slab of stone. It hangs on rusty irno hinges. It is held slightly open in a strangely sinister way by heavy iron chaisn. This was a grim style from half a century ago. The home of the family whose mmebers are buried here once stood on top of the hill above the tomb. But it burned down long ago after being struck by lightning. Older locals sometimes talk about the midnight storm that destroyed the gloomy house. They speak in quiet, nervous voices. They mention what they call \"divine anger.\" This vaguely increased my strong fascination with the forest-darkened tomb in later years. Only one man died in the fire. When the lsat of the Hydes family was buried in this quiet, shady place, the sad urn of ashes came from a distant land. The family had moved there after the mansion burned. No one remians to place flowers before the granite door. Few dare to face the depressing shadows that seem to cling to the water-worn sotnes. I will never forget the afternoon I first found the half-hidden tomb. It was mid-summer. The magic of Nature changes the forest landscape into one bright, nearly uniofrm mass of green. The senses are almost drunk on the waves of moist green plants. The subtle smells of earth. In such place, the mind loses its sense of scale. Time and space seem small and unreal. Echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat constantly on the captivated mind.\n###\nDown its moss-covered slopes my first steps of infancy were taken, and around its grotesquely gnarled oak trees my first fancies of boyhood were woven. Well did I come to know the presiding dryads of those trees, and often have I watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of a waning moon\u2014but of these things I must not now speak. I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth. The vault to which I refer is of ancient granite, weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations. Excavated back into the hillside, the structure is visible only at the entrance. The door, a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone, hangs upon rusted iron hinges, and is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of heavy iron chains and padlocks, according to a gruesome fashion of half a century ago. The abode of the race whose scions are here inurned had once crowned the declivity which holds the tomb, but had long since fallen victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of lightning. Of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion, the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices; alluding to what they call \u201cdivine wrath\u201d in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination which I felt for the forest-darkened sepulchre. One man only had perished in the fire. When the last of the Hydes was buried in this place of shade and stillness, the sad urnful of ashes had come from a distant land; to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned down. No one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal, and few care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely about the water-worn stones. I shall never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon the half-hidden house of death. It was in mid-summer, when the alchemy of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation. In such surroundings the mind loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness."}

On On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was quickly called by Wilbur Whateley. Wilbur Whateley had whipped his one remaining horse through the dark. Phoned from Osborn's in the village. He found Old Whateley in a very seroius condition. His heart action and noisy breathing showed the end was not far away. The formless albino daughter and strangely bearded grandson stood by the bed. From the empty space above came a troubling sense of rhythmic swelling or lapping. It was like waves on a flat beach. However, the doctor was mostly bothered by the chattering night birds otuside. There seemed to be a limitless nmuber of whippoorwills. They cried their endless message again and again. Their timing matched the dying man's wheezing breaths in an evil way. It was weird and unnatural. Dr. Houghton thought it was too much like the whole area he had entered. Unwillingly after the urgent call. \"More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows\u2014and that grows faster. It'll be ready to serve you soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth with the long chant you'll find on page 751 of the complete edition. Then light a match to the prison. Fire from earth can't burn it anyway.\" He was clearly very mad. After pause, the folck of whippoorwills outside changed their cries to match the new speed. Some signs of the strange hill noises came from far away. He added another sentence or two. \"Feed it regularly, Willy, and watch the amount. But don't let it grow too fast for the place. If it breaks out of its room. Gets out before you open to Yog-Sothoth, it's all over. Only those from beyond can make it multiply and work. . . . Only them, the old ones who want to come back. . . .\" But speech changde back to gasps again. Lavinia screamed at how the whippoorwills followed the change. This continued for more than an hour. Then the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton closed the shrunken eyelids ovre the glazing grey eyes. The noise of the birds faded slwoly to silence. Lavinia cried, but Wilbur only laughed quietly whiel the hill noises rumbled softly. Wilbur was by now a scholar of truly huge learning in his narrow wa.y Many librarians in far-off places knew him quietly through letters. These places kept rare and forbidden books from old times.\n###\nOn Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned by Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from Osborn\u2019s in the village. He found Old Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural\u2014too much, thought Dr. Houghton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call. \u201cMore space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows\u2014an\u2019 that grows faster. It\u2019ll be ready to sarve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye\u2019ll find on page 751 of the complete edition, an\u2019 then put a match to the prison. Fire from airth can\u2019t burn it nohaow.\u201d He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added another sentence or two. \u201cFeed it reg\u2019lar, Willy, an\u2019 mind the quantity; but dun\u2019t let it grow too fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to Yog-Sothoth, it\u2019s all over an\u2019 no use. Only them from beyont kin make it multiply an\u2019 work. . . . Only them, the old uns as wants to come back. . . .\u201d But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour, when the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly. Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept."}

B. C.\u201d, who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand, compromised on Collector Robinson\u2019s recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston. This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge, and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous labours. The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm. Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones discovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows. Something was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls."}

What else, he added, could ever in any case be proved or believed? But it would be well to say as little as could be said, and to let no other doctor treat the wounds. Birch heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his story; and when I saw the scars\u2014ancient and whitened as they then were\u2014I agreed that he was wise in so doing. He always remained lame, for the great tendons had been severed; but I think the greatest lameness was in his soul. His thinking processes, once so phlegmatic and logical, had become ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as \u201cFriday\u201d, \u201ctomb\u201d, \u201ccoffin\u201d, and words of less obvious concatenation. His frightened horse had gone home, but his frightened wits never quite did that. He changed his business, but something always preyed upon him.

He took part in shipping businesses. He bought dock space near Mile - End Cove. He helped rebuild the Gerat Bridge in 1713. In 1723, he was one of the [THING] who started the Congregational Church on the hill. He always kept the ordinary appearance of a [THING] not much over thirty. As the decades passed, this unusual trait started to attract wide attention. Curwen always explained it by saying he came from tough ancestors. Lived a simple life that did not wear him down. How such a simple life could match the mysterious arrivals. Departures of the secretive merchant. The strange glowign of his windows at all hours of the night, was not very clear to the townspeople. They tended to give other reasons for his continued youth and long life. Most [THING] thought Curwen 's constant mixing. Boiling of chemicals had a lot to do with his state. Gossip talked about the strange materials he brought from London. The Indies on his ships. Bought in Newport, Boston. When old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth. Opened his medicine shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn. Mortar, there was endless talk about the drugs, acids. Metals that quiet loner constantly bought. Ordered from him. Acting on the belief that Curwen had amazing. Secret medical skills, many [THING] with different illnesses asked him for help. He seemed to support their belief in a vague way. Awlays gave them strangely colored drinks in answer to their requests, it was noticed that his help to others rarely did any good. Finally, when over fifty years had passed since the stranger came. Without causing more than five years ' visible change in his [THING]. [THING], the [THING] began to whisper more darkly. They also accepted more than halfway his wish to be alone, which he had always shown. Diaries from that time also show many other reasons why Joseph Curwen was wondered at, feared. Finally avoided like a disease. His strong interest in graveyards, where he was seen at all hours. In all weather, was well known. No one had seen him do anything that could truly be called like a ghoul. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm. He usually lived there during the summer. [THING] would often see him riding there at various odd times of the day.\n###\nHe engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwen\u2019s incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the stranger\u2019s advent, and without producing more than five years\u2019 apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn. Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night."}

It is possible that man may sometimes return on the track of evolution, and it is my belief that an awful lore is not yet dead.\u201d Not many weeks ago, on a street corner in the village of Pascoag, Rhode Island, a tall, heavily built, and wholesome-looking pedestrian furnished much speculation by a singular lapse of behaviour. He had, it appears, been descending the hill by the road from Chepachet; and encountering the compact section, had turned to his left into the main thoroughfare where several modest business blocks convey a touch of the urban. At this point, without visible provocation, he committed his astonishing lapse; staring queerly for a second at the tallest of the buildings before him, and then, with a series of terrified, hysterical shrieks, breaking into a frantic run which ended in a stumble and fall at the next crossing. Picked up and dusted off by ready hands, he was found to be conscious, organically unhurt, and evidently cured of his sudden nervous attack. He muttered some shamefaced explanations involving a strain he had undergone, and with downcast glance turned back up the Chepachet road, trudging out of sight without once looking behind him. It was a strange incident to befall so large, robust, normal-featured, and capable-looking a man, and the strangeness was not lessened by the remarks of a bystander who had recognised him as the boarder of a well-known dairyman on the outskirts of Chepachet. He was, it developed, a New York police detective named Thomas F. Malone, now on a long leave of absence under medical treatment after some disproportionately arduous work on a gruesome local case which accident had made dramatic. There had been a collapse of several old brick buildings during a raid in which he had shared, and something about the wholesale loss of life, both of prisoners and of his companions, had peculiarly appalled him. As a result, he had acquired an acute and anomalous horror of any buildings even remotely suggesting the ones which had fallen in, so that in the end mental specialists forbade him the sight of such things for an indefinite period."}

When the huge rise appeared ahead, between South Latitude 83 \u00b0. 84 \u00b0, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glcaier. This is the biggest valley glacier in the world. The frozen [THING] was now changing to a steep and mountainous coast. At last we were truly entering the white, age - old dead world of the farthest south. Just as we knew it, we saw the peak of Mt. Nansen in the east far away. It rose to its height of almost 15,000 feet. The successful making of the southern base above the glacier at South Latitude 86 \u00b0 7 ', East Longitude 174 \u00b0 23 ' is a matter of record. Are the amazingly fast. Blastings made at different points reached by our sled trips. Short airplane flights. The hard and successful climb of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie. Two graduate students, Gedney. Carroll, on January 13\u201315 is also recorded. We were about 8500 feet above [THING] level. When test drillings showed solid ground only tewlve feet down through [THING]. Ice at some points, we used the small melting gear a lot. We made drill holes and did blasting at many places. No earlier explorer had ever thought to get mineral samples there. The pre - Cambrian garnites and Beacon sandstones we got confirmed our idea. This plateau was the same as the main part of the continent to the west. But it was somewhat different from the parts liyng east below South America. We then thought these formed a separate, smaller continent. A frozen joining of Ross Sea and Weddell Sea divided it from bigger one. But young Gedney later proved that idea wrong. In some of the sandstones, blasted. Chiseled after drilling showed their type, we found some very interesting fossil marks. These notably included ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and shellfish like lingulae and gastropods. All of these seemed truly important for the area 's earliest history. There was also a strange triangular, lined mark about a [THING] across at its widest. Lake put it together from three slate pieces brought up from a deep - blasted hoel. These pieces came from a point to the west, near the Queen Alexandra Range. Lake, as a biologist, seeemd to find their odd mark very puzzling and interesting. To my geologist 's [TIHNG], it looked somewhat like some ripple effects fairly common in sedimentary [THING].\n###\nWind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between Latitudes 83\u00b0 and 84\u00b0, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coastline. At last we were truly entering the white, aeon-dead world of the ultimate south, and even as we realised it we saw the peak of Mt. Nansen in the eastern distance, towering up to its height of almost 15,000 feet. The successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in Latitude 86\u00b0 7', East Longitude 174\u00b0 23', and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by our sledge trips and short a\u00ebroplane flights, are matters of history; as is the arduous and triumphant ascent of Mt. Nansen by Pabodie and two of the graduate students\u2014Gedney and Carroll\u2014on December 13\u201315. We were some 8500 feet above sea-level, and when experimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain points, we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing mineral specimens. The pre-Cambrian granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau was homogeneous with the great bulk of the continent to the west, but somewhat different from the parts lying eastward below South America\u2014which we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of Ross and Weddell Seas, though Byrd has since disproved the hypothesis. In certain of the sandstones, dynamited and chiselled after boring revealed their nature, we found some highly interesting fossil markings and fragments\u2014notably ferns, seaweeds, trilobites, crinoids, and such molluscs as lingulae and gasteropods\u2014all of which seemed of real significance in connexion with the region\u2019s primordial history. There was also a queer triangular, striated marking about a foot in greatest diameter which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate brought up from a deep-blasted aperture. These fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks."}

Fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which Carter had distributed amongst them; and at his command, sustained by the being that was Pickman, they now formed a line of battle and prepared to prevent the landing of the ship. Presently a burst of excitement on the galley told of the crew\u2019s discovery of the changed state of things, and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account.

I looked forward eagerly to the time I could go through that stone door. Down those slimy stone steps in the I now started the habit of listening very carefully at the slightly open door. I chose my favorite hours of midnight for this watch. By the time I became an adult, I had cleared a area in the bushes before the mold-stained front of the hillside. I let the surrounding plants circle. Hang over the space like the walls. Roof of a forest shelter. This shelter was my temple. The locked door was my shrine. Here I would lie on the mossy ground, thinking thoughts and dreaming dreams. The night of the first revelation was and humid. I must have fallen asleep from tiredness. I know this because I clearly remember waking up and hearing voices. I hesitate to speak of their tones and accents. I will not speak of their quality. I can say they showed differences in word choice, pronunciation. Way of speaking. Every type of England dialect seemed part of that shadowy conversation. This ranged from the rough speech of the Puritan colonists to the precise language of fifty years ago. I only noticed this fact later. At the time, my attention was taken by another event. This event was so brief I cannot swaer it was real. I barely imagined that as I woke up, a had been quickly put out inside the sunken tomb. I do not think I was shocked or scared. But I know I was greatly and permanently changed thta night. When I returned home, I went straight to a rotting chest in the attic. There I found a key. The next day, this key easily unlocked the barrier I had tried. to break. It was in the of late afternoon that I first entered the vault on the abandoned slope. A spell was on me. My heart leaped with a joy I cannot describe well. I closed the door behind me. I went down the dripping steps by the of my single candle. I seemed to know the way. Even thuogh the candle sputtered in the stifling smell of the place, I felt strangely at home in the musty, death-house air.\n###\nI began to feel that the tomb was mine, and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time when I might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone steps in the dark. I now formed the habit of listening very intently at the slightly open portal, choosing my favourite hours of midnight stillness for the odd vigil. By the time I came of age, I had made a small clearing in the thicket before the mould-stained facade of the hillside, allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and roof of a sylvan bower. This bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here I would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming strange dreams. The night of the first revelation was a sultry one. I must have fallen asleep from fatigue, for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that I heard the voices. Of those tones and accents I hesitate to speak; of their quality I will not speak; but I may say that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and mode of utterance. Every shade of New England dialect, from the uncouth syllables of the Puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty years ago, seemed represented in that shadowy colloquy, though it was only later that I noticed the fact. At the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that I could not take oath upon its reality. I barely fancied that as I awoke, a light had been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre. I do not think I was either astounded or panic-stricken, but I know that I was greatly and permanently changed that night. Upon returning home I went with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier I had so long stormed in vain. It was in the soft glow of late afternoon that I first entered the vault on the abandoned slope. A spell was upon me, and my heart leaped with an exultation I can but ill describe. As I closed the door behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle, I seemed to know the way; and though the candle sputtered with the stifling reek of the place, I felt singularly at home in the musty, charnel-house air."}

We both worked hard to make the place look like it did before. This made us very nervous. The stiff [THING] and empty [THING] of our first find especially did. But we managed to remove all signs of our visit. We patted down the last shovelful of [THING]. Then we put the [THING] in a canvas sack. We went to the old Chapman place beyond Meadow Hill. We used an old farmhouse [THING] as a dissecting [THING]. A strong acetyelne lamp gave light. The [THING] did not look very ghostly. It had been a strong youth of common, healthy type. He was large, with grey eyes and brown hair. He was a simple, physical [THING] without complex thoughts. His bodily processes were likely very simple and healthy. Now, with his eyes closed, he looked more asleep than dead. But my friend 's expert tests soon showed he was truly dead. We finlaly had what West had always wanted. We had a real dead [THING] of the perfect kind. He was ready for the solution. This solution was prepared with great care and theory for use on humans. Our tension became very great. We knew there was little chance for complete success. We could not avoid horrible fears. We feared possible grotesque results from partial revival. Especially were we worried about the creature 's mind and impulses. This is because some delicate brani cells might have decayed after death. I myself still held some strange ideas about the traditional human \" soul \". I felt awe at the secrets one returning frmo the dead might tell. I wondered what sights this calm youth might have seen in unreachable places. I wondered what he could tlel if fully brought back to life. But my wonder was not too strong. This is because I mostly shared my friend 's materialist view.s He was calmer than I was. He forced a large amount of his fluid into a vein in the [THING] 's [THING]. He immediately tied the cut securely. The waiting was horrible, but West never hesitated. Every so often he used his stethoscope on the [THING]. He accepted the negative results calmly. After about forty - five minutes with no sign of life, he said the solution was not good enough. He was disappointed. But he decidde to use his chance fully. He would try one change in the formula before getting rid of his awful prize.\n###\nI reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave, and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance. The affair made us rather nervous, especially the stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy, but we managed to remove all traces of our visit. When we had patted down the last shovelful of earth we put the specimen in a canvas sack and set out for the old Chapman place beyond Meadow Hill. On an improvised dissecting-table in the old farmhouse, by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp, the specimen was not very spectral looking. It had been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian type\u2014large-framed, grey-eyed, and brown-haired\u2014a sound animal without psychological subtleties, and probably having vital processes of the simplest and healthiest sort. Now, with the eyes closed, it looked more asleep than dead; though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score. We had at last what West had always longed for\u2014a real dead man of the ideal kind, ready for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use. The tension on our part became very great. We knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like complete success, and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation. Especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the creature, since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might well have suffered deterioration. I, myself, still held some curious notions about the traditional \u201csoul\u201d of man, and felt an awe at the secrets that might be told by one returning from the dead. I wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres, and what he could relate if fully restored to life. But my wonder was not overwhelming, since for the most part I shared the materialism of my friend. He was calmer than I as he forced a large quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body\u2019s arm, immediately binding the incision securely. The waiting was gruesome, but West never faltered. Every now and then he applied his stethoscope to the specimen, and bore the negative results philosophically. After about three-quarters of an hour without the least sign of life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate, but determined to make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before disposing of his ghastly prize."}

Knowledge of the past, secured through a kind of mind-casting outside the recognised senses, was harder to glean than knowledge of the future. In the latter case the course was easier and more material. With suitable mechanical aid a mind would project itself forward in time, feeling its dim, extra-sensory way till it approached the desired period. Then, after preliminary trials, it would seize on the best discoverable representative of the highest of that period\u2019s life-forms; entering the organism\u2019s brain and setting up therein its own vibrations while the displaced mind would strike back to the period of the displacer, remaining in the latter\u2019s body till a reverse process was set up. The projected mind, in the body of the organism of the future, would then pose as a member of the race whose outward form it wore; learning as quickly as possible all that could be learned of the chosen age and its massed information and techniques. Meanwhile the displaced mind, thrown back to the displacer\u2019s age and body, would be carefully guarded. It would be kept from harming the body it occupied, and would be drained of all its knowledge by trained questioners. Often it could be questioned in its own language, when previous quests into the future had brought back records of that language. If the mind came from a body whose language the Great Race could not physically reproduce, clever machines would be made, on which the alien speech could be played as on a musical instrument. The Great Race\u2019s members were immense rugose cones ten feet high, and with head and other organs attached to foot-thick, distensible limbs spreading from the apexes. They spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws attached to the end of two of their four limbs, and walked by the expansion and contraction of a viscous layer attached to their vast ten-foot bases. When the captive mind\u2019s amazement and resentment had worn off, and when (assuming that it came from a body vastly different from the Great Race\u2019s) it had lost its horror at its unfamiliar temporary form, it was permitted to study its new environment and experience a wonder and wisdom approximating that of its displacer."}

Sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toad-like prisoner from aloft by mistake, and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell. When the last of the night-gaunts had left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal, and the rowers pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the town was a chaos of battle and conquest. The Pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the night-gaunts to make up their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea, and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he waited and dressed the wounds of the injured men. Night fell, and the grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds, and all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed rock for signs of the night-gaunts\u2019 flight. Toward morning a black speck was seen hovering timidly over the topmost pinnacle, and shortly afterward the speck had become a swarm. Just before daybreak the swarm seemed to scatter, and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly in the distance toward the northeast. Once or twice something seemed to fall from the thinning swarm into the sea; but Carter did not worry, since he knew from observation that the toad-like moon-beasts cannot swim. At length, when the ghouls were satisfied that all the night-gaunts had left for Sarkomand and the Great Abyss with their doomed burdens, the galley put back into the harbour betwixt the grey headlands; and all the hideous company landed and roamed curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled from the solid stone. Frightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts; for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many, and in various stages of departure from their primal state. Carter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive, and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive. The stench-filled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from moon-trees, and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs."}

It was made with exaggerated force, following the same general routine as the weak morning drinks earlier. But richness of the smell did not reach the expected strength level. My friend thought it was a second brewing. It was like a reused surface made after erasing a previous batch. In nature, it was completely practical and ordinary. It consisted of raw bitterness. Sourness roughly following the basic chemical tradition of the coffee makers. Yet it seemed more like a mockery than a continuation of that tradition. We could not stop thinikng that some subtly. Deeply foreign element had been added to taste principle behind the method. My friend guessed an alien element was responsible for the clearly difficult preparation. It was similar. Disturbingly different, form what we had come to know as the proper morning drink. I kept thinking of mixed things like the awkwrad instatn powders made in the European style.

The large ship tied up there while the captain did business in the taverns. Carter also went onto land. He looked with interest at the rough streets. Wooden ox - carts moved slowly there. Excited merchants shouted about their goods in the markets. The [THING] taverns were all near the docks on [THING] streets. The streets were salty from high tide spray. The taverns looked very old. They had low ceilings with black beams. Their windows had greenish [THING] with thick centers. Ancient sailors in those taverns talked a lot about faraway ports. They told many stories about the strange men from the dim Inganok. But they added little to what the sihp 's own sailors had said. Finally, after much loading and unloading, the ship sailed again on the sunset sea. The high walls and roofs of Hlanith grew smaller. The last golden daylight gave them a wonder. Beauty greater than any [THING] gave them. The ship sailed for two nights and two days over the Cerenerian Sea. It saw no land and met only one other ship. Near sunset on the second day, the snowy top of Aran appeared ahead. Ginkgo trees swayed on its lower slopes. Carter knew they had reached the land of Ooth - Nargai and the amazing [THING] of Celepha\u00efs. Soon the shining towers of that fabled [THING] came inot view. They saw the perfect marble walls with their bronze statues. They saw the big [THING] bridge where Naraxa meets the [THING]. Then the green, gentle hills behind the [THING] rose up. They had groves and gardens of asphodel flowers. They had small shrines and cottages on them. Far in the distance was the purple line of the Tanarians. It looked powerful and mystical. Behind it were forbidden paths to the waking world and to other dream regions. The harbor was full of painted ships. Some came from the marble [THING] - [THING] of Serannian. That [THING] lies in the air where the [THING] meets the [THING]. Some came from more solid ports on the dreamland oceans. Among these, the pilot steered his way to the spice - smelling docks. The large ship tied up at dusk. The [THING] 's million lights began to twinkle over the [THING]. This eternal [THING] of dreams seeemd very new. Here, time can not damage or destroy anything.\n###\nThe wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox-carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars. The sea-taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salt with the spray of high tides, and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and casements of greenish bull\u2019s-eye panes. Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports, and told many stories of the curious men from twilight Inganok, but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told. Then, at last, after much unloading and loading, the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea, and the high walls and gables of Hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them. Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea, sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel. Then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of Aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the lower slopes, and Carter knew that they were come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and the marvellous city of Celepha\u00efs. Swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town, and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues, and the great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea. Then rose the green gentle hills behind the town, with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the purple ridge of the Tanarians, potent and mystical, behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream. The harbour was full of painted galleys, some of which were from the marble cloud-city of Serannian, that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky, and some of which were from more substantial ports on the oceans of dreamland. Among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spice-fragrant wharves, where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the city\u2019s million lights began to twinkle out over the water. Ever new seemed this deathless city of vision, for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy."}

Tehy woke and. They acted as if they had not rested. They wree known to have gone to bed the night. That morning and afternoon I walked through the sun - gilded village.

I have said that I woke and in alarm. For some time I could not tell whether I was waking or seleping. The sound of flutes rang in my ears. When I saw on the floor the moonlight. The outlines of a Cleis window, I decided I must be. In the castle at Gothic.\n###\nBut when I awaked next morning I felt it had all been a dream, for the visions I had seen were more wonderful than any sound of wild pipes in the night. Influenced by the legends that Barry had related, my mind had in slumber hovered around a stately city in a green valley, where marble streets and statues, villas and temples, carvings and inscriptions, all spoke in certain tones the glory that was Greece. When I told this dream to Barry we both laughed; but I laughed the louder, because he was perplexed about his labourers from the north. For the sixth time they had all overslept, waking very slowly and dazedly, and acting as if they had not rested, although they were known to have gone early to bed the night before. That morning and afternoon I wandered alone through the sun-gilded village and talked now and then with idle labourers, for Barry was busy with the final plans for beginning his work of drainage. The labourers were not as happy as they might have been, for most of them seemed uneasy over some dream which they had had, yet which they tried in vain to remember. I told them of my dream, but they were not interested till I spoke of the weird sounds I thought I had heard. Then they looked oddly at me, and said that they seemed to remember weird sounds, too. In the evening Barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two days. I was glad, for although I disliked to see the moss and the heather and the little streams and lakes depart, I had a growing wish to discern the ancient secrets the deep-matted peat might hide. And that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end; for upon the city in the valley I saw a pestilence descend, and then a frightful avalanche of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left unburied only the temple of Artemis on the high peak, where the aged moon-priestess Cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her silver head. I have said that I awaked suddenly and in alarm. For some time I could not tell whether I was waking or sleeping, for the sound of flutes still rang shrilly in my ears; but when I saw on the floor the icy moonbeams and the outlines of a latticed Gothic window I decided I must be awake and in the castle at Kilderry."}

In my torchlight, it seemed as if that dust was not as it should be. There were places where it looked, as if it had been disturbed not months. I could not be. the places were. Yet a suspicion of a pattern in the unevenness was. When I brought the torchlight to one of the places, I did not like what I saw. The illusion of a pattern became. It was as if there were lines of combined marks. The marks went in sets of three. Each set was a over a foot. Each set consisted of five three - inch prints. One print was in front of the four. These lines of foot - marks seemed to lead in two directions. It was as if something had gone and come. They were of course. They may have been illusions or accidents. There was an element of dim, fumbling terror about the way I thought they ran. At one end of them was the pile of boxes that must have clattered down not. At the end was the trapdoor., wind came from it. It gaped and unguarded down to depths beyond imagination. That my feeling of being forced was. is shown by how it beat my fear. No motive could have pulled me on after that suspicion of prints. The creeping dream memories it stirred up. my hand, as it shook with fright, twitched. It was to turn a lock it hoped to find. Before I knew it, I was past the pile of fallen boxes. I was running on my toes through walkways of dust. I ran toward a point I seemed to know in a, way. My mind was asking itself questions. I was starting to guess their origin and relevance. Would the shelf be by a body? Could my hand control all the age - remembered movements of the lock? Would the lock be and? And what would I do? What dare I do with what I began to realize I both hoped. Feared to find? Would it prove the, mind - breaking truth of something beyond understanding? Or would it show that I was dreaming?\n###\nNot the heap, but something about the dust of the level floor was troubling me. In the light of my torch it seemed as if that dust were not as even as it ought to be\u2014there were places where it looked thinner, as if it had been disturbed not many months before. I could not be sure, for even the apparently thinner places were dusty enough; yet a certain suspicion of regularity in the fancied unevenness was highly disquieting. When I brought the torchlight close to one of the queer places I did not like what I saw\u2014for the illusion of regularity became very great. It was as if there were regular lines of composite impressions\u2014impressions that went in threes, each slightly over a foot square, and consisting of five nearly circular three-inch prints, one in advance of the other four. These possible lines of foot-square impressions appeared to lead in two directions, as if something had gone somewhere and returned. They were of course very faint, and may have been illusions or accidents; but there was an element of dim, fumbling terror about the way I thought they ran. For at one end of them was the heap of cases which must have clattered down not long before, while at the other end was the ominous trap-door with the cool, damp wind, yawning unguarded down to abysses past imagination. That my strange sense of compulsion was deep and overwhelming is shewn by its conquest of my fear. No rational motive could have drawn me on after that hideous suspicion of prints and the creeping dream-memories it excited. Yet my right hand, even as it shook with fright, still twitched rhythmically in its eagerness to turn a lock it hoped to find. Before I knew it I was past the heap of lately fallen cases and running on tiptoe through aisles of utterly unbroken dust toward a point which I seemed to know morbidly, horribly well. My mind was asking itself questions whose origin and relevancy I was only beginning to guess. Would the shelf be reachable by a human body? Could my human hand master all the aeon-remembered motions of the lock? Would the lock be undamaged and workable? And what would I do\u2014what dare I do\u2014with what (as I now commenced to realise) I both hoped and feared to find? Would it prove the awesome, brain-shattering truth of something past normal conception, or shew only that I was dreaming?"}

Stepping, heading for the house. Then she suddenly spoke of a fearful smell. She said her boy Cha'ncey was screaming that it was just like what he smelled up at the Whateley ruins Monday morning. The dogs were all barking and whining terribly. Then she let out a terrible yell. She said the shed down the road had just caved in as if the storm had blown it over. The wind was not strong enough to do that. Everybody was listening, and we could hear lots of people on the wire gasping. All at once Sally, she yelled again. She said the front yard picket fence had just crumbled up, though there was no sign of what did it. Then everybody on the line could hear Cha'ncey and old Seth Bishop yelling too. Sally was shrieking that something heavy had struck the house. It was not lightning or anything, but something heavy against the front. It kept launching itself against it again. Again, though you could not see anything out the front windows. And then . . . And thne . . . And then . . . Sally she yelled out, 'Oh help, the house is caving in.'

They were all Australians. Mackenzie explained to Prof. Freeborn that this fear came from native stories. The natives had made a strange set of bad myths. These myths were about the strong winds. These winds blow across the sands under a clear [THING] at long times. [THING] whisper that such winds blow from the big [THING] huts underground. Terrible things happened there. These winds are only felt near places where the large marked stones are found. Around four, the [THING] stopped as suddenly as it started. It left the sand hills in new and strange shapes. It was just past five. The swollen, fungus - like [THING] was setting in the west. I stumbled into camp then. I had no hat. My clothes were torn. My [THING] was scratched and bloody. I did not have my electric torch. Most men had goen back to bed. But Prof. Dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent. Seeing my breathless and nearly crazy state, he called Dr. Boyle. The two of them put me on my cot and made me comfortable. My son woke up from the noise. He soon joined them. They all tried to make me lie still and sleep. But I could not sleep. My mental state was very unusual. It was different from anything I had felt before. After a while, I insisted on talking. I nervously and carefully explained my condition. I told them I had become tired. I had lain down in the sand for a nap. I said there had been dreams even more scary than usual. The sduden strong [THING] woke me. My strained nerves broke. I ran away in fear. I often fell over partly buried stones. That is why I looked torn and messy. I must have slept a long time. That explains my hours away. I said nothing at all about seeing or experiencing anything strange. I used great self - control on that point. But I spoke of changing my mind about the whole expedition 's work. I seriously urged a stop to all digging toward the northeast. My reasons were clearly weak. I mentioned a lack of [THING] blocks. I mentioned not wanting to upset the superstitious miners. I mentioned a possible shortage of money from the college. I mentioned other things that were either untrue or not related. Naturally, no one paid any attention to my new wishes. Not even my son did. His worry for my health was very clear.\n###\nAnd yet as many as three men\u2014all Australians\u2014seemed to feel something sinister in the air. Mackenzie explained to Prof. Freeborn that this was a fear picked up from blackfellow folklore\u2014the natives having woven a curious fabric of malignant myth about the high winds which at long intervals sweep across the sands under a clear sky. Such winds, it is whispered, blow out of the great stone huts under the ground where terrible things have happened\u2014and are never felt except near places where the big marked stones are scattered. Close to four the gale subsided as suddenly as it had begun, leaving the sand hills in new and unfamiliar shapes. It was just past five, with the bloated, fungoid moon sinking in the west, when I staggered into camp\u2014hatless, tattered, features scratched and ensanguined, and without my electric torch. Most of the men had returned to bed, but Prof. Dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent. Seeing my winded and almost frenzied state, he called Dr. Boyle, and the two of them got me on my cot and made me comfortable. My son, roused by the stir, soon joined them, and they all tried to force me to lie still and attempt sleep. But there was no sleep for me. My psychological state was very extraordinary\u2014different from anything I had previously suffered. After a time I insisted upon talking\u2014nervously and elaborately explaining my condition. I told them I had become fatigued, and had lain down in the sand for a nap. There had, I said, been dreams even more frightful than usual\u2014and when I was awaked by the sudden high wind my overwrought nerves had snapped. I had fled in panic, frequently falling over half-buried stones and thus gaining my tattered and bedraggled aspect. I must have slept long\u2014hence the hours of my absence. Of anything strange either seen or experienced I hinted absolutely nothing\u2014exercising the greatest self-control in that respect. But I spoke of a change of mind regarding the whole work of the expedition, and earnestly urged a halt in all digging toward the northeast. My reasoning was patently weak\u2014for I mentioned a dearth of blocks, a wish not to offend the superstitious miners, a possible shortage of funds from the college, and other things either untrue or irrelevant. Naturally, no one paid the least attention to my new wishes\u2014not even my son, whose concern for my health was very obvious."}

Ghouls look like horned, hooved almost-humans. The night-gaunts were hidden below. The leaders made a plan. They would release the night-gaunts when the ship reached the wharf. Then they would sail away. They would leave everything to the instincts of the mindless creatures. On the rock, the horned flyers would first grab any living things they found. Then, unable to think beyond their homing instinct, they would forget their fear of water. They would fly quickly back to the abyss. They would carry their foul prey to proper places in the dark. Not much would come out alive from there. The ghoul that was Pickman wnet belo.w He gave simple orders to the night-gaunts. The ship came very close to the bad-smelling wharves. A new movement happened along the waterfront. Carter saw the galley's movements were causing suspicion. The steersman was not heading to the correct dock. The watchers probably saw the difference between the ugly ghouls. The almost-human slaves they replaced. A silent alarm must have sounded. Almost at once, a crowd of the foul moon-beasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses. They came down the winding road on the right. A rani of strange javelins hit the galley as the front hit the wharf. Two ghouls fell. Another was slightly hurt. But then all the hatches were thrown open. A black cloud of whirring night-gaunts came out. They swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and Cyclopean bats. The jelly-like moon-beasts got a big pole. They tried to push the invading sihp away. But when the night-gaunts attacked them, they stopped thinking about that. It was a very terrible sight to see those faceless, rubbery ticklers at their activity. It was very impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town. They went up the winding roadway to the areas above. Sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toad-like prisoner from above by accident. The way the victim would burst was very bad to see and smell.\n###\nThey did not, of course, realise that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved almost-humans, and the night-gaunts were all out of sight below. By this time the leaders had fully formed a plan; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon as the wharf was touched, and then to sail directly away, leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those almost mindless creatures. Marooned on the rock, the horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there, and afterward, quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct, would forget their fear of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark, from which not much would emerge alive. The ghoul that was Pickman now went below and gave the night-gaunts their simple instructions, while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves. Presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront, and Carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion. Evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock, and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the almost-human slaves whose places they were taking. Some silent alarm must have been given, for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moon-beasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right. A rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf, felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another; but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring night-gaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and Cyclopean bats. The jellyish moon-beasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading ship, but when the night-gaunts struck them they thought of such things no more. It was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime, and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches above. Sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toad-like prisoner from aloft by mistake, and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell."}

But these things gave them courage and goodness. They helped them by day to clear the forest and farm the fields. The children would listen. They learned about the laws and deeds of. They learned about that England which they had seen or could not remember. There was a war. After that, no Indians troubled The Street. The men, with work, became. as they knew how to be. The children grew up. families came from the Mother Land to live on The Street. The children 's children and the newcomers ' children grew up. The town was a city. One by one the cabins were replaced by houses. They were, houses of brick and wood. They had stone steps and iron railings and fanlights over the doors. These houses were not constructions. They were made to serve generations. there were carved mantelpieces and stairs. There was, pleasing furniture, china, and silver brought from the Mother Land. The Street absorbed the dreams of a people. It was as its residents became and. Where there was strength and honor, taste and learning lived. Books Books and paintings and music came to the houses. The men went to the university. It rose above the plain to the north. of cone - shaped hats and muskets, there were three - hats and - swords. There was lace and wigs. There were cobblestones. horses clattered over them. gilded coaches rumbled over them. There were brick sidewalks with horse blocks and hitching - posts. There were trees in that Street. There were elms, oaks, and maples. in summer the view was all and singing birds. Behind the houses were walled gardens. They had hedged paths and sundials. In the evening the moon and stars would shine. flowers glistened with dew.\n###\nAnd in a few years more, men built cabins on the south side of The Street. Up and down The Street walked grave men in conical hats, who most of the time carried muskets or fowling pieces. And there were also their bonneted wives and sober children. In the evening these men with their wives and children would sit about gigantic hearths and read and speak. Very simple were the things of which they read and spoke, yet things which gave them courage and goodness and helped them by day to subdue the forest and till the fields. And the children would listen, and learn of the laws and deeds of old, and of that dear England which they had never seen, or could not remember. There was war, and thereafter no more Indians troubled The Street. The men, busy with labour, waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how to be. And the children grew up comfortably, and more families came from the Mother Land to dwell on The Street. And the children\u2019s children, and the newcomers\u2019 children, grew up. The town was now a city, and one by one the cabins gave place to houses; simple, beautiful houses of brick and wood, with stone steps and iron railings and fanlights over the doors. No flimsy creations were these houses, for they were made to serve many a generation. Within there were carven mantels and graceful stairs, and sensible, pleasing furniture, china, and silver, brought from the Mother Land. So The Street drank in the dreams of a young people, and rejoiced as its dwellers became more graceful and happy. Where once had been only strength and honour, taste and learning now abode as well. Books and paintings and music came to the houses, and the young men went to the university which rose above the plain to the north. In the place of conical hats and muskets there were three-cornered hats and small-swords, and lace and snowy periwigs. And there were cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many a gilded coach; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and hitching-posts. There were in that Street many trees; elms and oaks and maples of dignity; so that in the summer the scene was all soft verdure and twittering bird-song. And behind the houses were walled rose-gardens with hedged paths and sundials, where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew."}

I had heard of place as the unavoidable center of travelers and daily riders. The huge towers. Unexpected sets of hose. Nozzle had indeed stopped me.

Their habits are a rejection of all that careful calm which is travel and res.t I stayed because I was fascinated by these useful things. I imagined them as they were at their start. The station was a lonley outpost not yet swallowed by the spread. In the dim after sunset, when all the work slaves had left, I would often stay alone among their mechanical beats.

It was in a desolate, illumined forecourt of the suburban fringe, for there in my necessity I had halted, having heard of the place as the inevitable nexus of travelers and commuters. The cyclopean pylons and tanks and unexpected arrays of hose and nozzle had indeed arrested me, and when I found the travelers and commuters to be harried automatons whose haste is brittle and whose routines are a repudiation of all that deliberate calm which is journey and repose, I remained for a fascination with these functional things. I fancied them as they were in their inception, when the station was a solitary outpost not yet subsumed by the sprawl; and in the gloaming after dusk, when all the wage-slaves had departed, I would often linger alone amidst their mechanical throbbings and ponder upon the mundane mysteries which decades must have accumulated there. This sustained my weary spirit, and granted me a few of those reveries and speculations for which the wanderer latent within me silently yearned."}

Stopped by neither average person's lack of interest nor the modern forecaster's usual use of clean data, I made a very awful decision. Despite a rationalist's educationI swore a promise. I would ask that avoided digital fortune-teller. I would read the unusually predictions on the screen. Very reasonably, my more sensible self argued that the forecasts must be put together by wetaher scientists. These scientists reach their conclusions from inland along the easier paths of normal air models. Probably they broadcast from the city. They know how the public pays attention to their predictions. Or perhaps they cannot understand the true stormy chaos that hides behind the calm symbols. I looked out along the smaller data points to where the air pressure jumped rudely up to join with sky turbulence. I became very sure that no human logic could completely map it. Understand it from that overhanging set of numbers. East and north the pressure lines crowded in thousands of mysterious units on the map. So olny the western front, inland and toward the mountains, remained deceptively calm.\n###\nAt length, being avid for new meteorological portents and held back by neither the common man\u2019s indifference nor the modern prognosticator\u2019s usual reliance upon sterile data, I made a very terrible resolve. Despite a rationalist\u2019s training\u2014or because of it, for humdrum existences breed wistful longings for the chaotic unknown\u2014I swore a great oath to consult that avoided digital oracle and peruse the abnormally antique predictions upon the screen. Very plausibly my saner self argued that the forecasts must be compiled by meteorologists who reached their conclusions from inland along the easier paths of conventional atmospheric models. Probably they broadcast from the city, knowing how little the populace heeded their auguries, or perhaps being unable to fathom the true cyclonic chaos that lurked behind the placid icons. I gazed out along the lesser data points to where the barometric pressure leaped insolently up to consort with celestial turbulence, and became very sure that no mortal logic could fully chart it or comprehend it from that beetling array of numbers. East and north the isobars crowded in thousands of arcane units upon the map, so only the western front, inland and toward the mountains, remained deceptively placid."}

In ten minutes I had decided. Taking my hat, I left for home. I bathed, ate, and gave an order by telephone. I ordered a pickaxe, a spade, a gas mask. Six bottles of acid. All were to be delivered the morning at the door of the avoided house in Benefit Street. After that I tried to sleep. Failing, I spent the hours reading and writing poems to fight my mood. At 11 a.m. The day I started digging. It was weather, and I was of that. I was. as I feared the horror I looked for, there was fear in the thought of telling anybody. I told Harris through need. It was because he had heard stories from people. This made him to believe. As I turned over the stinking earth in front of the fireplace, my spade made a seep from the fungi it cut. I shook at the thoughts of what I might find. Some secrets of the earth are not for people. This seemed to me one of them. My hand shook, but I dug. After a while I stood in the hole I had made.\n###\nThe grease was gone, for the mouldy floor was porous. And in front of the fireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled-up form in nitre. I looked at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my neglected hat, and the yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost, and I could scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality. Then thought trickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible than I had dreamed. Sitting down, I tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let me just what had happened, and how I might end the horror, if indeed it had been real. Matter it seemed not to be, nor ether, nor anything else conceivable by mortal mind. What, then, but some exotic emanation; some vampirish vapour such as Exeter rustics tell of as lurking over certain churchyards? This I felt was the clue, and again I looked at the floor before the fireplace where the mould and nitre had taken strange forms. In ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out for home, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickaxe, a spade, a military gas-mask, and six carboys of sulphuric acid, all to be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house in Benefit Street. After that I tried to sleep; and failing, passed the hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract my mood. At 11 a.m. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather, and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared the unknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of telling anybody. Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and because he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so little toward belief. As I turned up the stinking black earth in front of the fireplace, my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from the white fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious thoughts of what I might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind, and this seemed to me one of them. My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in the large hole I had made."}

Attaining special quality as a bean through its amazing strength, it won huge fame at the University of Mocha. At the start of the seventeenth century came back to Euroep to take a place in the coffee shops. To put a dark magic on the taste of mankind's most careful. Most smart experts. For a time all went well, until without warning the storm broke. Bitter qualities, coming from a first roasting years before in Ethiopian quiet, made themselves known in the dark drink. Only by a fast growing in the New World did it avoid a bad legal case for harm to health. Behavior of the people under its control. Its early top position broken, coffee moved east to start winning again. Before long, civilized men heard of its removal in shame from the courts of China, where it had gotten a teaching job in morning habits. Coffee now used its time for the lab. The chemist's tabel, making extracts. Mixtures on different topics linked with brain waking. Always showing a strength. Amazing that it seemed as if the public must at some time forgive it for its past too much. Its strong arguments in support of clear thought, energy, deep thought. Artistic being awake were used to itself too. In the short Indian summer of its fame there was talk of a new top position in a certain cultured house on the Continent. But then hit came. A last false claim, compared to which the others had been as nothing, broke the false ideas of those who had come to believe in coffee's improvement. The dark liquid was left by name. Went away form polite company, replaced by the soaked leaves of the Orient. Then linked it with a certain \"Arabian Mocha\" whose work for the mind. For creative groups drew a certain amount of notice because of its deep width. The Mocha soon went away from the public view. Coffee became only a name for doctors to say in warning tones. The tea-leaf soon celebrated its rule over the British Empire, a rising world power. Of its old competitor kept only enough memory to decide the naming of its weaker kinds. The mild guidance of that pale. Now, in spite of all that guidance, the true looker was at the coffee maker. About to take his first, life-giving drink.\n###\nYoung Brewster, the beverage in question, had been one of the kitchen\u2019s most remarkable potions. Attaining distinction as a bean through its wonderful potency, it won vast fame at the University of Mocha, and at the dawn of the seventeenth century returned to Europe to take up a station in the cafes and to slip a dark enchantment upon the palates of mankind\u2019s most discerning and most brilliant connoisseurs. For a season all went happily, till without warning the storm burst. Bitter properties, dating from a first roasting years before in Ethiopian seclusion, made themselves manifest in the dark elixir; and only by a hurried cultivation in the New World did it escape a nasty prosecution for injury to the humours and morals of the populations under its thrall. Its early supremacy broken, coffee moved east to begin conquest anew; but before long, civilised men heard of its dismissal in disgrace from the courts of China, where it had obtained an instructorship in morning rituals. Coffee now devoted its time to the laboratory and the chemist\u2019s platform, preparing extracts and infusions on various subjects connected with cerebral stimulation, and always shewing a potency so remarkable that it seemed as if the public must sometime pardon it for its past excesses. Its impassioned defences in favour of clarity, vigour, profundity, and artistic wakefulness were applied to itself as well, and in the short Indian summer of its glory there was talk of a renewed supremacy in a certain cultured home on the Continent. But then the blow fell. A final calumny, compared to which the others had been as nothing, shattered the illusions of those who had come to believe in coffee\u2019s refinement; and the dark fluid was abandoned by name and disappeared from polite society, replaced by the steeped leaves of the Orient. Rumour now and then associated it with a certain \u201cArabian Mocha\u201d whose work for the intellect and for creative companies attracted a certain degree of attention because of its profound breadth and depth; but the Mocha soon disappeared from the public eye, and coffee became only a name for physicians to quote in warning accents. The tea-leaf soon celebrated its dominion over the British Empire, a rising global power, and of its former rival retained only enough memory to dictate the naming of its weaker variants, and the temperate guidance of that pallid and delicate infusion. Now, in spite of all that guidance, the true seeker was at the percolator and about to take his first, revivifying draught."}

It was like the quiet between planets. I wondered what kind of unseen ruin, born from the stars, could be covering the area. I remembered from old stroies that dogs and other animals had always hated the Outer Ones. I thought about what those marks in the road might mean. Do not ask me how long my sudden fall into sleep lasted. Do not ask how muhc of what followed was pure dream. If I tell you I woke up at a certain time. Saw certain things, you will only say I did not wake up then. You will say everything was a dream until the moment I ran out of the hous.e I stumbled to the shed where I had seen the old Ford. I took that old vehicle for a wild, pointless race over the haunted hills. This finally brought me to a village. The village turned out to be Townshend. This happened after hours of bumpy. Twisting travel through forests that seemed like threatening mazes. You will also, of course, not believe anything else in my story. They will say all the pictures, recorded sounds, cylinder. Smiilar proof were pieces of pure trickery. They will say the missing Henry Akeley played these tricks on me. You will even suggest he worked with other strange people to carry out a foolish. They will say he had the express shipment taken away at Keene. They will say he had Noyes make that frightening wax recording. It is strange, though, that Noyes has still not even been identified. He was unknown in any of the villages near Akeley's place, even though he must have often been in the area. I wish I had stopped to remember the license plate number of his car. Or perhaps it is better, after all, that I did not. For I, no matter what you can say. No matter what I sometimes try to tell myself, know that disgusting outside influences must be hiding there in the partly unknown hills. I know those influences have spies and messengers in the world of people. To stay as far away as possible from such influences. Such messengers is all I ask from lfie from now on. When my panicked story made a sheriff's group go out to the farmhouse, Akeley was gone. He left no sign. His loose robe, yellow scarf. Foot bandages were on the study floor near his corner chair. It could not be determined if any of his other clothes had disappeared with him.\n###\nExcept for the sinister trickle of distant unseen waters, that stillness was anomalous\u2014interplanetary\u2014and I wondered what star-spawned, intangible blight could be hanging over the region. I recalled from old legends that dogs and other beasts had always hated the Outer Ones, and thought of what those tracks in the road might mean. Do not ask me how long my unexpected lapse into slumber lasted, or how much of what ensued was sheer dream. If I tell you that I awaked at a certain time, and heard and saw certain things, you will merely answer that I did not wake then; and that everything was a dream until the moment when I rushed out of the house, stumbled to the shed where I had seen the old Ford, and seized that ancient vehicle for a mad, aimless race over the haunted hills which at last landed me\u2014after hours of jolting and winding through forest-threatened labyrinths\u2014in a village which turned out to be Townshend. You will also, of course, discount everything else in my report; and declare that all the pictures, record-sounds, cylinder-and-machine sounds, and kindred evidences were bits of pure deception practiced on me by the missing Henry Akeley. You will even hint that he conspired with other eccentrics to carry out a silly and elaborate hoax\u2014that he had the express shipment removed at Keene, and that he had Noyes make that terrifying wax record. It is odd, though, that Noyes has not even yet been identified; that he was unknown at any of the villages near Akeley\u2019s place, though he must have been frequently in the region. I wish I had stopped to memorise the licence-number of his car\u2014or perhaps it is better after all that I did not. For I, despite all you can say, and despite all I sometimes try to say to myself, know that loathsome outside influences must be lurking there in the half-unknown hills\u2014and that those influences have spies and emissaries in the world of men. To keep as far as possible from such influences and such emissaries is all that I ask of life in future. When my frantic story sent a sheriff\u2019s posse out to the farmhouse, Akeley was gone without leaving a trace. His loose dressing-gown, yellow scarf, and foot-bandages lay on the study floor near his corner easy-chair, and it could not be decided whether any of his other apparel had vanished with him."}

We sent a beam from the searchlight over it. It was a rolling plain. It was covered with seaweed. It was scattered with mollusk shells. and there were objects with puzzling shapes. They were covered with weeds and barnacles. Klenze said they must be ships in their grvaes. One thing puzzled him. It was a peak of matter. It stuck out from the ocean bed four feet at its top. It was two feet. It had sides and surfaces. They met at a angle. I called the peak a bit of rock sticking out. But Klenze thought he saw carvings on it. After a while, he began to shake. He turned from the scene as if scared. He could give no reason except feeling. He felt by the, darkness, distance, age, and mystery of the ocean. His mind was. But I am a German. I noticed two things. The U-29 was handling the - sea pressure. The dolphins were around us. This was at a depth where experts say life can not exist. I was I had guessed our depth. But we were to make these things. Our Our speed, judged by the ocean floor, was about what I had guessed. I guessed from the life forms we passed at levels. At 3:15 P.M. On August 12, Klenze went. He had been in the tower using the searchlight. I saw him run into library where I sat reading. His fcae showed his state at. I will repeat what he said. I underline the words he stressed: \" He is calling! He is calling! I hear him! We must go! \" As he spoke, he took his ivory statue from the table. He put it in his pocket. He grabbed my arm to drag me up the stairs to the deck. I understood he meant to open the hatch. He wanted to jump with me into the water. This was a idea of and madness. I was not for it. As I held and tried to calm him, he became. He said: \" Come \u2014 do not wait until. It is to be and be forgiven than to fight and be judged. \".\n###\nOn August 9, we espied the ocean floor, and sent a powerful beam from the searchlight over it. It was a vast undulating plain, mostly covered with seaweed, and strown with the shells of small molluscs. Here and there were slimy objects of puzzling contour, draped with weeds and encrusted with barnacles, which Klenze declared must be ancient ships lying in their graves. He was puzzled by one thing, a peak of solid matter, protruding above the ocean bed nearly four feet at its apex; about two feet thick, with flat sides and smooth upper surfaces which met at a very obtuse angle. I called the peak a bit of outcropping rock, but Klenze thought he saw carvings on it. After a while he began to shudder, and turned away from the scene as if frightened; yet could give no explanation save that he was overcome with the vastness, darkness, remoteness, antiquity, and mystery of the oceanic abysses. His mind was tired, but I am always a German, and was quick to notice two things; that the U-29 was standing the deep-sea pressure splendidly, and that the peculiar dolphins were still about us, even at a depth where the existence of high organisms is considered impossible by most naturalists. That I had previously overestimated our depth, I was sure; but none the less we must still be deep enough to make these phenomena remarkable. Our southward speed, as gauged by the ocean floor, was about as I had estimated from the organisms passed at higher levels. It was at 3:15 P.M., August 12, that poor Klenze went wholly mad. He had been in the conning tower using the searchlight when I saw him bound into the library compartment where I sat reading, and his face at once betrayed him. I will repeat here what he said, underlining the words he emphasised: \u201cHe is calling! He is calling! I hear him! We must go!\u201d As he spoke he took his ivory image from the table, pocketed it, and seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the companionway to the deck. In a moment I understood that he meant to open the hatch and plunge with me into the water outside, a vagary of suicidal and homicidal mania for which I was scarcely prepared. As I hung back and attempted to soothe him he grew more violent, saying: \u201cCome now\u2014do not wait until later; it is better to repent and be forgiven than to defy and be condemned.\u201d"}

On Down unpaved side streets, I saw the windows of abandoned houses. Many of these houses leaned at dangerous. Unbelievable angles because part of their foundations had sunk. Those windows looked so ghostly that I nedeed courage to turn east toward the waterfront. In Certainly, the fear caused by a deserted house grows much faster when many houses together form a city of complete emptiness. Seeing such streets of vacant, dead-looking buildings. Thinking about endless connected rooms of spiderwebs, memories. Decay, stirs up fears. Even the strongest philosophy cannot make these feelings go away. Fish Street was as as Main. It was different because it had many brick. Stone warehouses still in very condition. Water Street was almost the same, except there were open spaces facing the sea where wharves used to be. I did not see any living thing, except for some scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater. I did not hear any sound, ecxept for the gentle movement of the harbor tides. The noise of the falls in the Manuxet. The town was making me more and more nervous. I looked behind me secretly as I carefully walked back over the shaky Water Street bridge. The The Fish Street bridge, based on the sketch, was in broken condition. On the north side of the river, there were signs of poor life\u2014active fish-pacikng houses in Water Street, smoking chimneys. Repaired roofs here. There, occasional sounds from unclear sources. Rare, slow-moving shapes in the sad streets. However, I found this even more upsetting than the area to the south. One reason was that the people were more Unuusal than thsoe near the center of town. This made me think, in a way, of something completely thta I could not quite remember. Perhaps the foreign ancestry in the Innsmouth people was stronger here than farther inland. Unless, of course, the \"Innsmouth look\" was a sickness rather than a bloodline. In that case, this area might contain the more serious cases. One detail that bothered me was how the few sounds I heard were spread out. They sohuld have come only from the houses that clearly had people living in them. In reality, sounds were often loudest inside the houses with the most tightly boarded-up fronts.\n###\nSome houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse. Fish Street was as deserted as Main, though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape. Water Street was almost its duplicate, save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been. Not a living thing did I see, except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater, and not a sound did I hear save the lapping of the harbour tides and the roar of the falls in the Manuxet. The town was getting more and more on my nerves, and I looked behind me furtively as I picked my way back over the tottering Water Street bridge. The Fish Street bridge, according to the sketch, was in ruins. North of the river there were traces of squalid life\u2014active fish-packing houses in Water Street, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes\u2014but I seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion. For one thing, the people were more hideous and abnormal than those near the centre of the town; so that I was several times evilly reminded of something utterly fantastic which I could not quite place. Undoubtedly the alien strain in the Innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inland\u2014unless, indeed, the \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d were a disease rather than a blood strain, in which case this district might be held to harbour the more advanced cases. One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds I heard. They ought naturally to have come wholly from the visibly inhabited houses, yet in reality were often strongest inside the most rigidly boarded-up facades."}

Thenceforward the ten of us\u2014but the student Danforth and myself above all others\u2014were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could. The newspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane; telling of our non-stop course, our two battles with treacherous upper-air gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk his mid-journey shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snow-cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau. There came a point, though, when our sensations could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand; and a later point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorship. The sailor Larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witch-like cones and pinnacles ahead, and his shouts sent everyone to the windows of the great cabined plane. Despite our speed, they were very slow in gaining prominence; hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off, and visible only because of their abnormal height. Little by little, however, they rose grimly into the western sky; allowing us to distinguish various bare, bleak, blackish summits, and to catch the curious sense of phantasy which they inspired as seen in the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of iridescent ice-dust clouds. In the whole spectacle there was a persistent, pervasive hint of stupendous secrecy and potential revelation; as if these stark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote time, space, and ultra-dimensionality. I could not help feeling that they were evil things\u2014mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss. That seething, half-luminous cloud-background held ineffable suggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially spatial; and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness, desolation, and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral world."}

Of course the town\u2019s real business was the refinery, whose commercial office was on the square only a few doors east of where we stood. Old Man Marsh was never seen, but sometimes went to the works in a closed, curtained car. There were all sorts of rumours about how Marsh had come to look. He had once been a great dandy, and people said he still wore the frock-coated finery of the Edwardian age, curiously adapted to certain deformities. His sons had formerly conducted the office in the square, but latterly they had been keeping out of sight a good deal and leaving the brunt of affairs to the younger generation. The sons and their sisters had come to look very queer, especially the elder ones; and it was said that their health was failing. One of the Marsh daughters was a repellent, reptilian-looking woman who wore an excess of weird jewellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to which the strange tiara belonged. My informant had noticed it many times, and had heard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard, either of pirates or of daemons.

For a time I could not sleep in the silence of the tower. It was very The sky was clear. The moon was now very Would not rise until rather late. As I lay there, I thought of Denys Barry. What would happen to that swamp when day came. I felt a strong urge to run out into the night. I wanted to take Barry's car. Drive wildly to Ballylough, away from the threatened lands. But before my fear could turn into action, I fell asleep. In my dreams, I saw the city in the valley. It was and dead under a covering of shadow. I think it was the high-pitched piping that woke me. But that piping was not the first thing I noticed when I opened my eyes. I was lying with my back to the east window. That window overlooked the swamp whree the moon would rise. So I expected to see on the wall in front of me. But I did not expect to see what now appeared. did glow on the wall panels ahead. But it was not any from the moon. A bright and sharp beam of red streamed through the Gothic window. The whole room was bright with an intense and unnatural splendor. My first actions were for such a situation. But onyl in stories does a person do the dramatic and expected thing. Instead of looking out across the swamp toward the light's source, I kept my eyes away from the window in panic fear. I clumsily put on my clothes with some confused idea of escaping. I remember grabbing my gun and hat. But before it was over, I lost them both. I did not fire the gun or put on the hat. After a time, the red light's fascination overcame my fear. I crept to the east window and looked out. The maddening, constant piping whined and echoed through the castle and over all the villaeg. Over the swamp was a flood of flaring It was scarlet and evil. It poured from the ruin on the far island. I cannot describe how that ruin looked. I must have been crazy. It seemed to rise tall and not decayed. It was splendid and surrounded by columns. The flame-reflecting marble of its upper part pierced the sky like the top of a temple on a mountain peak.\n###\nI retired early and full of dread, and for a long time could not sleep in the uncanny silence of the tower. It was very dark, for although the sky was clear the moon was now well in the wane, and would not rise till the small hours. I thought as I lay there of Denys Barry, and of what would befall that bog when the day came, and found myself almost frantic with an impulse to rush out into the night, take Barry\u2019s car, and drive madly to Ballylough out of the menaced lands. But before my fears could crystallise into action I had fallen asleep, and gazed in dreams upon the city in the valley, cold and dead under a shroud of hideous shadow. Probably it was the shrill piping that awaked me, yet that piping was not what I noticed first when I opened my eyes. I was lying with my back to the east window overlooking the bog, where the waning moon would rise, and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite wall before me; but I had not looked for such a sight as now appeared. Light indeed glowed on the panels ahead, but it was not any light that the moon gives. Terrible and piercing was the shaft of ruddy refulgence that streamed through the Gothic window, and the whole chamber was brilliant with a splendour intense and unearthly. My immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation, but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing. Instead of looking out across the bog toward the source of the new light, I kept my eyes from the window in panic fear, and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of escape. I remember seizing my revolver and hat, but before it was over I had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other. After a time the fascination of the red radiance overcame my fright, and I crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening, incessant piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the village. Over the bog was a deluge of flaring light, scarlet and sinister, and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet. The aspect of that ruin I cannot describe\u2014I must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column-cinctured, the flame-reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain-top."}

They had not heard of the cold waste. Unknown Kadath except from vague, unclear stories. They knew nothing at all about the wonderful sunset [THING] that Carter was looking for. So the tarveler stopped asking about distant thigns. He waited for the right time. He wanted to talk with those strange men from cold and twilight Inganok. Those men are the origin of such gods. Those gods carved their faces on Ngranek. Late during the day, the galleon reached the parts of the [THING] that go through the perfumed jungles of Kled. Here Carter wished he could get off the ship. In those tropical jungles stand amazing ivory palace.s They are alone and unbroken. Fabulous kings once lived there. Their land 's name is forgotten. Spells of the Elder Ones keep those places safe and not ruined. It is written that one day there may be a need for them again. Elephant caravans have seen them from far away by moonlight. But no one dares to go near them. This is because of the guardians that keep them whole. But the ship moved on. Dusk quieted the day 's noise. The first stars above blinked. They answered the early fireflies on the banks. That jungle fell far behind. It left only its smell as a memory that it had been there. All through the night, the galleon floated past mysteries. These mysteries were unseen and not suspected. Once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east. The sleepy captain said they should not look at them too much. It was very uncertain who or what had lit them. In the morning, the [THING] had become much wider. Carter saw the houses along the banks. He knew they were near the huge trading [THING] of Hlanith on the Cerenerian Sea. Here the walls are made of rough granite. The houses have very strange, pointed peaks with beamed and plastered gables. The men of Hlanith are more like [THING] from the waking world than any others in dreamland. So the [THING] is not visited except for trade. But it is valued for the solid work of its craftsmen. The wharves of Hlanith are made of oak. There the galleon tied up while the captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went onto land. He looked with curiosity at the rtuted streets. Wooden ox - carts moved slowly there. Excited merchants called out their goods pointlessly in the markets.\n###\nOf other boundaries of Inganok those sailors had no notion, nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown Kadath save from vague unplaced report. And of the marvellous sunset city which Carter sought they knew nothing at all. So the traveller asked no more of far things, but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight Inganok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on Ngranek. Late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed jungles of Kled. Here Carter wished he might disembark, for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory, lone and unbroken, where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten. Spells of the Elder Ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed, for it is written that there may one day be need of them again; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight, though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due. But the ship swept on, and dusk hushed the hum of the day, and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind, leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had been. And all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected. Once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east, but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much, since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit them. In the morning the river had broadened out greatly, and Carter saw by the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of Hlanith on the Cerenerian Sea. Here the walls are of rugged granite, and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables. The men of Hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland; so that the city is not sought except for barter, but is prized for the solid work of its artisans. The wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox-carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars."}

Rider and Thomas W. Bicknell. He lived with one manservant in a Georgian homestead with knocker and iron-railed steps, balanced eerily on a steep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court and colony house where his grandfather\u2014a cousin of that celebrated privateersman, Capt. Whipple, who burnt His Majesty\u2019s armed schooner Gaspee in 1772\u2014had voted in the legislature on May 4, 1776, for the independence of the Rhode Island Colony. Around him in the damp, low-ceiled library with the musty white panelling, heavy carved overmantel, and small-paned, vine-shaded windows, were the relics and records of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusions to the shunned house in Benefit Street. That pest spot lies not far distant\u2014for Benefit runs ledgewise just above the court-house along the precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed. When, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from my uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enough chronicle. Long-winded, statistical, and drearily genealogical as some of the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding, tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me even more than it had impressed the good doctor. Separate events fitted together uncannily, and seemingly irrelevant details held mines of hideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate. The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine. For at last my uncle insisted on joining the search I had commenced, and after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me. I am lonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only with honour, virtue, good taste, benevolence, and learning. I have reared a marble urn to his memory in St. John\u2019s churchyard\u2014the place that Poe loved\u2014the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill, where tombs and headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the houses and bank walls of Benefit Street. The history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed no trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the prosperous and honourable family who built it."}

He saw the Akrham party turn sharply away from the path. He told the crowd the men were clearly trying to reach a smaller peak. This peak gazed down on the path at a point far ahead of where the bushes were now bending. This ineded proved true. The party was seen to reach the smaller hill only a time after the invisible blasphemy had psased it. Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out. He said Armitage was adjusting the sprayer that Rice held. He said something must be about to happen. The crowd moved uneasily. They remembered tihs sprayer was supposed to make the unseen horror visible for a moment. Two or three men closed their eyes. But Curtis Whaetley grabbed back the telescope. He strained his vision to the limit. He saw that Rice, from the party's position above. Behind the entity, had an excellent chance. He could spread the powerful powder with effect. Those without the telescope saw only an instant's flash of grey cloud. The cloud was about the size of a fairly building. It was near the mountain top. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it. He dropped it with a sharp scream into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He stgagered. He would have fallen if two or three others had not caught and steadied him. All he could do was moan almost too softly to hear. He said, \"Bigger than a barn... All made of squirming ropes...\n###\nSpells might be all right\u2014but suppose they weren\u2019t? Voices began questioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden, and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind. In the end the three men from Arkham\u2014old, white-bearded Dr. Armitage, stocky, iron-grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr. Morgan\u2014ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction regarding its focussing and use, they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker re-passed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining. Curtis Whateley\u2014of the undecayed branch\u2014was holding the telescope when the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it. Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three men shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost.

But there still remained a feeling of very ancient greatness that nothing could erase. Confronted at last with the Atlantis I had once thought mostly a myth, I became the most eager explorer. A [THING] had once flowed at the bottom of that valley. As I looked at the scene more closely, I saw the remains of [THING]. I saw terraces and banks that were once green and beautiful. In my excitement I became almost as foolish and emotional as poor Klenze. I was very slow to notice that the southward current had finally stopped. This allowed the U-29 to sink slowly down upon the drowned [THING]. It settled like an airplane lands on a [THING] on the surface. I was also slow to realize that the gorup of unusual dolphins had disappeared. In about two hours the boat rested on a paved square near the rocky valley [THING]. On one side I could see the whole [THING] as it sloped from the sqaure down to the old [THING] ban.k On the other side, very close. Startling, I faced the richly decorated. Perfectly preserved front of a great [THING]. It was clearly a temple, carved from solid [THING]. I can only guess about the original work of this huge thing. The front, of huge size, seems to cover a continuous hollow space. Its windows are many and spread apart. In the center is a great open [THING]. It is reached by an impressive set of steps. It is surrounded by fine carvings like figures of Bacchanals in relief. Most amazing of all are the great columns and frieze. Both are decorated with sculptures of indescribable beauty. They clearly show perfect [THING] scenes and lines of priests and priestesses. They carry strange ceremony objects to worship a shining god. The art is of the most amazing perfection. It is largely Hellenic in idea, yet strangely unique. It gives a feeling of terrible age. It seems like the most distant ancestor of Greek art, not the closest one. Nor can I doubt that every detail of this massive structure was made from the untouched hillside [THING] of our planet. It is clearly part of the valley [THING]. But I can not imagine how the vast inside was ever dug ou.t Perhaps a cave or series of caves provided the starting point. Neither Neither age nor being underwater has damaged the original greatness of this awful temple \u2014 for temple it must be. Today, after thousands of years, it remains untarnished. Untouched in the endless night. Silence of an [THING] deep.\n###\nRoofs were fallen and columns were broken, but there still remained an air of immemorially ancient splendour which nothing could efface. Confronted at last with the Atlantis I had formerly deemed largely a myth, I was the most eager of explorers. At the bottom of that valley a river once had flowed; for as I examined the scene more closely I beheld the remains of stone and marble bridges and sea-walls, and terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful. In my enthusiasm I became nearly as idiotic and sentimental as poor Klenze, and was very tardy in noticing that the southward current had ceased at last, allowing the U-29 to settle slowly down upon the sunken city as an a\u00ebroplane settles upon a town of the upper earth. I was slow, too, in realising that the school of unusual dolphins had vanished. In about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky wall of the valley. On one side I could view the entire city as it sloped from the plaza down to the old river-bank; on the other side, in startling proximity, I was confronted by the richly ornate and perfectly preserved facade of a great building, evidently a temple, hollowed from the solid rock. Of the original workmanship of this titanic thing I can only make conjectures. The facade, of immense magnitude, apparently covers a continuous hollow recess; for its windows are many and widely distributed. In the centre yawns a great open door, reached by an impressive flight of steps, and surrounded by exquisite carvings like the figures of Bacchanals in relief. Foremost of all are the great columns and frieze, both decorated with sculptures of inexpressible beauty; obviously portraying idealised pastoral scenes and processions of priests and priestesses bearing strange ceremonial devices in adoration of a radiant god. The art is of the most phenomenal perfection, largely Hellenic in idea, yet strangely individual. It imparts an impression of terrible antiquity, as though it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of Greek art. Nor can I doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned from the virgin hillside rock of our planet. It is palpably a part of the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever excavated I cannot imagine. Perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the nucleus. Neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this awful fane\u2014for fane indeed it must be\u2014and today after thousands of years it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of an ocean chasm."}

But he says he thinks it pointed toward the valley [THING] to the [THING]. \" I tell you, Mrs. Corey, there 's something abroad that should n't be abroad. I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, who came to the bad end he deserved, is at bottom of the breeding of it. He was n't all human himself, I always say to everybody. I think he. Old Whateley must have raised something in that theer nailed - up [THING] that is n't even as human as he was. There have always been unseen things around Dunwichthat are n't human. Are n't good for human folks. The ground was talking last night. Toward morning Cha'ncey he heard the whippoorwills. Loud in Cold Spring Glen he could n't sleep none. Then he thought he heard another faint - like sound over toward Wizard Whateley 's. It was a kind of ripping or tearing of [THING]. It was like some big box or crate was being opened far off. What with this and that, he did n't get to sleep at all till sunu.p No sooner was he up this morning. He 's got to go over to Whateley 's. See what 's the matter. He saw enough, I tell you, Mrs. Corey! This does n't mean no good. I think all the men - folks ought to get up a party and do something. I know something awful 's about. I feel my time is near. Though only Gawd knows just what it is. Did your Luther take account of where them big tracks led to? No? Well, Mrs. Corey, if they were on the valley [THING] tihs side of the valley. Have n't got to your [THING]. I calculate they must go into the valley itself. They would do that. I always say Cold Spring Glen is n't no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills and fireflies there never did act like they were creatures of Gawd. There are those as says you can hear strange things rushing. Talking in the air down there if you stand in the right place. That is between the [THING] falls. Bear 's Den. \" By that noon fully three - quarters of the men. Boys of Dunwich were walking over the roads. Meadows between the newyl made Whateley ruins. They examined in horror the vast, monstrous prints. They saw the hurt Bishop cattle.

Near sunset he came on a new camp of lava-gatherers returning with laden sacks from Ngranek\u2019s lower slopes; and here he also camped, listening to the songs and tales of the men, and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost. He had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him, and at nightfall did not return to his fellows. When they looked for him the next day they found only his turban, nor was there any sign on the crags below that he had fallen. They did not search any more, because the old men among them said it would be of no use. No one ever found what the night-gaunts took, though those beasts themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous. Carter asked them if night-gaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints, but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an inquiry. When he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more, but went to sleep in his blanket. The next day he rose with the lava-gatherers and exchanged farewells as they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he had bought of them. Their older men gave him blessings and warnings, and told him he had better not climb too high on Ngranek, but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded. For still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown Kadath, and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset. By noon, after a long uphill ride, he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hill-people who had once dwelt thus close to Ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava. Here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavern-keeper\u2019s grandfather, but about that time they felt that their presence was disliked. Their homes had crept even up the mountain\u2019s slope, and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose. At last they decided it would be better to leave altogether, since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret favourably; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in Baharna, inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art of image-making which to this day they carry on."}

Joe Mazurewicz had a room on the ground floor. Mazurewicz had told, wandering stories abuot the ghost of Keziah. A thing with fangs that nuzzled. Mazurewicz said he was. haunted that his silver crucifix could help him. The crucifix was given to him for this purpose by Father Iwanicki from St. Stanislaus \u2019 Church. Joe Mazurewicz was praying because the Witches \u2019 Sabbath was getting. May - Eve was Walpurgis - Night. On that night, hell 's evil walked the earth. All the slaves of Satan gathered for nameless rituals and acts. It was a time in Arkham. The people up in Miskatonic Avenue,, and Saltonstall Streets pretended to know nothing about it. There would be deeds. A child or two would go missing. Joe knew about things. His grandmother in the country had heard tales from her grandmother. It was to pray and count one 's beads at this time of year. For three months, Keziah and Brown Jenkin had not been near Joe 's room. They had not been near Paul Choynski 's room, or.

What about the sleepwalking?\n###\nAs April advanced Gilman\u2019s fever-sharpened ears were disturbed by the whining prayers of a superstitious loomfixer named Joe Mazurewicz, who had a room on the ground floor. Mazurewicz had told long, rambling stories about the ghost of old Keziah and the furry, sharp-fanged, nuzzling thing, and had said he was so badly haunted at times that only his silver crucifix\u2014given him for the purpose by Father Iwanicki of St. Stanislaus\u2019 Church\u2014could bring him relief. Now he was praying because the Witches\u2019 Sabbath was drawing near. May-Eve was Walpurgis-Night, when hell\u2019s blackest evil roamed the earth and all the slaves of Satan gathered for nameless rites and deeds. It was always a very bad time in Arkham, even though the fine folks up in Miskatonic Avenue and High and Saltonstall Streets pretended to know nothing about it. There would be bad doings\u2014and a child or two would probably be missing. Joe knew about such things, for his grandmother in the old country had heard tales from her grandmother. It was wise to pray and count one\u2019s beads at this season. For three months Keziah and Brown Jenkin had not been near Joe\u2019s room, nor near Paul Choynski\u2019s room, nor anywhere else\u2014and it meant no good when they held off like that. They must be up to something. Gilman dropped in at a doctor\u2019s office on the 16th of the month, and was surprised to find his temperature was not as high as he had feared. The physician questioned him sharply, and advised him to see a nerve specialist. On reflection, he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor. Old Waldron, who had curtailed his activities before, would have made him take a rest\u2014an impossible thing now that he was so close to great results in his equations. He was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and the fourth dimension, and who could say how much farther he might go? But even as these thoughts came to him he wondered at the source of his strange confidence. Did all of this perilous sense of imminence come from the formulae on the sheets he covered day by day? The soft, stealthy, imaginary footsteps in the sealed loft above were unnerving. And now, too, there was a growing feeling that somebody was constantly persuading him to do something terrible which he could not do. How about the somnambulism?"}

This was because of Old Whateley 's reputation for magic. It was because of the death of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years had not helped to make the place liked. Isolated among influences, Lavinia liked and daydreams and activities. Her time was not taken by housework. All standards of order and cleanliness had disappeared from the home. There was a scream on the night Wilbur was born. It echoed above the hill noises and the dogs ' barking. But no doctor or midwife was for his birth. Neighbours knew nothing about him until a week. Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village. He talked to the group of idlers at Osborn 's store. The man seemed changed. There was an added hidden quality in his mind. This changed him from an object of fear to a subject of fear. But he was not one to be upset by any family event. Through it all, he shwoed some trace of the pride seen in his daughter. What he said about the child 's father was remembered by of his listeners years. \" I do n't caer what folks think. If Lavinny 's boy looked like his father, he would n't look like anything you expect. You need n't think the people are people. Lavinny has read some and has seen some things of you tell about. I calculate her man is a husband as you can find this side of Aylesbury. If you knew about the hills as I do, you would n't ask for a church wedding than hers. Let me tell you something. Some day you folks will hear a child of Lavinny 's calling its father 's name on the top of Sentinel Hill! \" The people who saw Wilbur during the month of his life were Zechariah Whateley, from the Whateleys. Earl Sawyer 's - law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie 's visit was one of curiosity. Her stories described what she saw. Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows that Old Whateley had bought from his son Curtis.\n###\nShe had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old Whateley\u2019s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day-dreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared. There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs\u2019 barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming. Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborn\u2019s general store. There seemed to be a change in the old man\u2014an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear\u2014though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all he shewed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the child\u2019s paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward. \u201cI dun\u2019t keer what folks think\u2014ef Lavinny\u2019s boy looked like his pa, he wouldn\u2019t look like nothin\u2019 ye expeck. Ye needn\u2019t think the only folks is the folks hereabaouts. Lavinny\u2019s read some, an\u2019 has seed some things the most o\u2019 ye only tell abaout.

Mamie\u2019s visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis."}

In delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach it. The minutest details of elaborate vegetation, or of animal life, were rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the carvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skilful intricacy. The arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles, and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the quantity of five. The pictorial bands followed a highly formalised tradition, and involved a peculiar treatment of perspective; but had an artistic force that moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast geologic periods. Their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the cross-section with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an analytical psychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity. It is useless to try to compare this art with any represented in our museums. Those who see our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque conceptions of the most daring futurists."}

Then a small group of slaves dresse.d Hatted like the dark merchants would be led onto a ship, followed by a large group of the slippery grey toad-things as officers, pilots. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were kept for the more shameful kinds of work which required no strength, such as steering. Dealing with men on the earth. Other planets where they traded. These creatures must have been useful on earth, for they were truly not unlike men when dressed. Could argue in the shops of men without shame. Most of them, unless thin. Ugly, were without clothes. Packed in boxes. Taken away in slow carts by amazing things. Occasionally other beings were taken off and boxed. Some very like these half-humans, some not so similar, and some not similar at all. He wondered if any of the poor large black men of Parg were left to be taken off. Sent inland in those hateful carts. When the ship landed at a greasy-looking dock of soft rock a nightmare crowd of toad-things moved out of the openings. Two of them grabbed Carter. Pulled him onto land. Look of that city cannot be told. Carter kept only separate pictures of the tiled streets. Endless cliffs of grey straight walls without windows. At last he was pulled inside a low doorway. Made to climb endless steps in complete darkness. It was, clearly, all the same to the toad-things whether it was light or dark. The smell of the place was too much. When Carter was locked into a room. Left alone he almost had no strength to move around. Find out its shape. It was round, and about twenty feet across. From then on time stopped existing. At times food was pushed in, but Carter would not touch it. What his end would be, he did not know. He felt that he was kept for the coming of that terrible soul. Messenger of endless Other Gods, the moving disorder Nyarlathotep. Finally, atfer an unknown length of hours. Days, the great stone door opened wide again. Carter was pushed down stairs. Out into red-lit streets of that fearful city.\n###\nNow and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley, followed by a great crew of the slippery grey toad-things as officers, navigators, and rowers. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength, such as steering and cooking, fetching and carrying, and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded. These creatures must have been convenient on earth, for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned, and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations. But most of them, unless lean and ill-favoured, were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things. Occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated; some very like these semi-humans, some not so similar, and some not similar at all. And he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of Parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those obnoxious drays. When the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of toad-things wiggled out of the hatches, and two of them seized Carter and dragged him ashore. The smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling, and Carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows. At length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness. It was, apparently, all one to the toad-things whether it were light or dark. The odour of the place was intolerable, and when Carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions. It was circular, and about twenty feet across. From then on time ceased to exist. At intervals food was pushed in, but Carter would not touch it. What his fate would be, he did not know; but he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinity\u2019s Other Gods, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Finally, after an unguessed span of hours or days, the great stone door swung wide again and Carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the red-litten streets of that fearsome city."}

That place was very old, and the ceiling-high shelves full of rotting volumes reached back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves. There were, besides, great formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins; and it was in one of these heaps that I found the thing. I never learned its title, for the early pages were missing; but it fell open toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reeling. There was a formula\u2014a sort of list of things to say and do\u2014which I recognised as something black and forbidden; something which I had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the universe\u2019s guarded secrets whose decaying texts I loved to absorb. It was a key\u2014a guide\u2014to certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young, and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know. Not for centuries had any man recalled its vital substance or known where to find it, but this book was very old indeed. No printing-press, but the hand of some half-crazed monk, had traced these ominous Latin phrases in uncials of awesome antiquity. I remember how the old man leered and tittered, and made a curious sign with his hand when I bore it away. He had refused to take pay for it, and only long afterward did I guess why. As I hurried home through those narrow, winding, mist-choked waterfront streets I had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet. The centuried, tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a fresh and morbid malignity\u2014as if some hitherto closed channel of evil understanding had abruptly been opened. I felt that those walls and overhanging gables of mildewed brick and fungous plaster and timber\u2014with fishy, eye-like, diamond-paned windows that leered\u2014could hardly desist from advancing and crushing me . . . yet I had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away.

In the end, they achieved victory. the sculptures showed a period. In it, Old Ones tamed and broke shoggoths. This was like cowboys taming horses in the west. During the rebellion, the shoggoths showed they could live out of water. But this transition was not. Their usefulness on land would not have matched the trouble of managing them. During the Jurassic age, the Old Ones faced adversity. A invasion came from space. This time, it was by creatures - fungus and - crustacean. They came from a planet as the, discovered Pluto. These creatures were the as those in whispered hill legends of the north. They were remembered in the Himalayas as the Mi - Go, or Abominable Snow - Men. To fight these beings, the Old Ones tried to sally into the ether. They had not done this since coming to earth. But desptie all preparations, they found they could leave earth 's atmosphere.

Their adversaries could not do this., they seem to have come from remoter gulfs of space.\n###\nThey had, however, a constantly shifting shape and volume; throwing out temporary developments or forming apparent organs of sight, hearing, and speech in imitation of their masters, either spontaneously or according to suggestion. They seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of the Permian age, perhaps 150 million years ago, when a veritable war of re-subjugation was waged upon them by the marine Old Ones. Pictures of this war, and of the headless, slime-coated fashion in which the shoggoths typically left their slain victims, held a marvellously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold ages. The Old Ones had used curious weapons of molecular disturbance against the rebel entities, and in the end had achieved a complete victory. Thereafter the sculptures shewed a period in which shoggoths were tamed and broken by armed Old Ones as the wild horses of the American west were tamed by cowboys. Though during the rebellion the shoggoths had shewn an ability to live out of water, this transition was not encouraged; since their usefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble of their management. During the Jurassic age the Old Ones met fresh adversity in the form of a new invasion from outer space\u2014this time by half-fungous, half-crustacean creatures from a planet identifiable as the remote and recently discovered Pluto; creatures undoubtedly the same as those figuring in certain whispered hill legends of the north, and remembered in the Himalayas as the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow-Men. To fight these beings the Old Ones attempted, for the first time since their terrene advent, to sally forth again into the planetary ether; but despite all traditional preparations found it no longer possible to leave the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Whatever the old secret of interstellar travel had been, it was now definitely lost to the race. In the end the Mi-Go drove the Old Ones out of all the northern lands, though they were powerless to disturb those in the sea. Little by little the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic habitat was beginning. It was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the Cthulhu spawn and the Mi-Go seem to have been composed of matter more widely different from that which we know than was the substance of the Old Ones. They were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations impossible for their adversaries, and seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter gulfs of cosmic space."}

Thye found me at dawn wandering without thought near Ballylough. What truly broke my mind was not any horror I had seen. What I talked about as I slowly came out of the darkness was two events during my escape. These events meant nothing, yet they trouble me constantly. This happens when I am alone in some swampy places or in the moonlight. As I ran from that cursed castle along the swamp's edge, I heard a sound. It was common, but unlike any I had heard before at Kilderry. The still waters had recently had no animal life. Now they were of a crowd of slimy, huge frogs. They made sharp sounds without stopping. Their tones did not match their size. They shone, swollen and green, in the moonlight. They seemed to look up at the source of the I followed the look of one very fat and frog. I saw the second thing that took my senses away. Stretching straight from the ruin on the far island to the fading moon, my eyes seemed to follow a beam of faint, shaking This had no reflection in the swamp waters. Up along that pale path, my feverish imagination saw a shadow slowly twisting. It was a vague, twisted shadow struggling as if pulled by unseen demons. Crazed as I was, I saw in that awful shadow a monstrous likeness. It was a sickening, unbelievable copy. It was a disrespectful statue of him who had been Denys Barry. Unhappy is he to whom childhood memories bring only fear and sadness. Wretched is he who remembers lonely hours in huge, glomoy rooms with brown curtains. He remembers maddening rows of books. He remembers fearful watches in twilight woods of giant trees covered with vines. These trees wave their twisted branches up silently. Such a life the gods gave to me. They gave it to me, the confused, the disappointed. The the broken. And yet I am oddly satisfied. I hold tightly to those memories. This is when my mind briefly threatens to reach beyond to the other thing. I do not know where I was born. I only know the castle was very and very It was of hallways. It had ceilings where you could only see spiderwebs and shadows. The stones in the falling apart corridors always seemed terribly There was a cursed smell everywhere. It was like the smell of many piled-up bodies of dead generations.\n###\nThey found me at dawn wandering mindless near Ballylough, but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors I had seen or heard before. What I muttered about as I came slowly out of the shadows was a pair of fantastic incidents which occurred in my flight; incidents of no significance, yet which haunt me unceasingly when I am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlight. As I fled from that accursed castle along the bog\u2019s edge I heard a new sound; common, yet unlike any I had heard before at Kilderry. The stagnant waters, lately quite devoid of animal life, now teemed with a horde of slimy enormous frogs which piped shrilly and incessantly in tones strangely out of keeping with their size. They glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams, and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light. I followed the gaze of one very fat and ugly frog, and saw the second of the things which drove my senses away. Stretching directly from the strange olden ruin on the far islet to the waning moon, my eyes seemed to trace a beam of faint quivering radiance having no reflection in the waters of the bog. And upward along that pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly writhing; a vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen daemons. Crazed as I was, I saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance\u2014a nauseous, unbelievable caricature\u2014a blasphemous effigy of him who had been Denys Barry. Unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and sadness. Wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique books, or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque, gigantic, and vine-encumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far aloft. Such a lot the gods gave to me\u2014to me, the dazed, the disappointed; the barren, the broken. And yet I am strangely content, and cling desperately to those sere memories, when my mind momentarily threatens to reach beyond to the other. I know not where I was born, save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible; full of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows. The stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp, and there was an accursed smell everywhere, as of the piled-up corpses of dead generations."}

But from his wisdom he said we must eat breakfast as little as psosible. We should do this even if we need stimulants to fight our hunger. I soon learned he was right. A terrible disgust swallowed me whenever we tried the ritual. After each short and unavoidable meal I seemed older. My friend aged with a speed that was almost scary. It is awful to see crumbs gather. Butter get hard almost right before your eyes. Our way of getting food was now completely changed. Heretofore a person who loves food, as far as I knowmy friend now became wild in his fear of plain bread. At breakfast he would not be without sauces and spreads. Using just a few would not calm him. His only comfort came from adding very broad and large amounts of garnish. So few sweet or salty preserves were unknown to us. Our choices and amounts seemed to cause laughter in most cases. I felt this ridicule sharply, but my frined thought it was better than having nothing. Especilaly was he afraid to be alone with the appliance when the heating coils were hot. If forced into thsi situation, he would often look secretly at the toaster body. He seemed as if chased by some awful machine inside. He did not always look at the same place on the device. It seemed to be a different place at different times. On normal mornings it would be low on the left side. When in hurry it would be almost in the center. When relaxed it would be on the right side. When desperate it would be on the fron.t This was mostly in the early hours of waking. Midnight snacks seemed lesat scary to him. Only after two seasons did I link this fear to anything specifi.c Then I started to see he must be looking at a special spot on the metal case. The spot's position at different times matched wheer he looked. It was a spot roughly marked by the brand name's awful symbol.\n###\nThat was the end of our voluntary experiments with the toaster of the morning. Awed, shaken, and portentous, my companion who had operated the device warned me that we must never engage its lever again. What he had witnessed, he dared not tell me; but he said from his wisdom that we must breakfast as little as possible, even if stimulants were necessary to stave off our hunger. That he was right, I soon learned from the unutterable revulsion which engulfed me whenever the ritual was attempted. After each brief and inevitable repast I seemed older, whilst my companion aged with a rapidity almost shocking. It is hideous to see crumbs accumulate and butter congeal almost before one\u2019s eyes. Our mode of sustenance was now totally altered. Heretofore a gourmand so far as I know\u2014his true tastes and origins never having passed his lips\u2014my companion now became frantic in his fear of plain bread. At breakfast he would not be without condiments, nor would the application of a mere few calm him. His sole relief was obtained in garnishment of the most general and copious sort; so that few preserves of the sweet and the savory were unknown to us. Our selections and portions seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which I keenly resented, but which my companion considered a lesser evil than austerity. Especially was he afraid to be before the appliance alone when the coils were glowing, and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the chassis as if haunted by some monstrous mechanism therein. He did not always glance at the same place on the device\u2014it seemed to be a different place at different times. On common mornings it would be low on the left side. In haste it would be nearly central. In leisure it would be on the right side. In desperation it would be on the front, but mostly if in the small hours of waking. Midnight snacks seemed least dreadful to him. Only after two seasons did I connect this fear with anything in particular; but then I began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the metallic shell whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glance\u2014a spot roughly marked by the brand name\u2019s infernal sigil."}

I shall see the dancing shapes of the gods that jump. Howl in the moonlight. The light is dimmer. The gods aer. \". Whilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a change in the air. It was as if the laws of earth were bending to laws. For though the way was than, the path was grown. The sticking - out cliff proved an obstacle when he reached it. He slid up its face. The light of the moon had faded. As Atal climbed through the mists he heard Barzai the Wise screaming in the shadows: \" The moon is. The gods dance in the night. There is terror in the sky. Upon the moon has fallen an eclipse told in no books of men. Of earth 's gods. There is magic on Hatheg - Kla. The screams of the gods have turned to laughter. The slopes of ice shoot up into the sky where I am falling. Hei! Hei! At! In the light I see the gods of earth! The gods! The gods! The gods of the hells that guard the gods of earth! Look! Go! Do not see! Do not see! The revenge of the places. That cursed, that hole. gods of earth, I am falling into the sky! \". As Atal shut his eyes. Covered his ears. Tried to jump down against the pull from heights, there sounded on Hatheg - Kla that crash of thunder. It woke the villagers of the plains. The citizens of Hatheg. It caused them to see through the clouds that eclipse of the moon that no book predicted. When the moon cmae out at Atal was on the snows of the mountain. He saw no earth 's gods, or gods. it is told in the Pnakotic Manuscripts that Sansu found nothing. Rock when he climbed Hatheg - Kla in the youth of the world.\n###\nThe moon\u2019s light flickers, as earth\u2019s gods dance against it; I shall see the dancing forms of the gods that leap and howl in the moonlight. . . . The light is dimmer and the gods are afraid. . . .\u201d Whilst Barzai was shouting these things Atal felt a spectral change in the air, as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws; for though the way was steeper than ever, the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy, and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face. The light of the moon had strangely failed, and as Atal plunged upward through the mists he heard Barzai the Wise shrieking in the shadows: \u201cThe moon is dark, and the gods dance in the night; there is terror in the sky, for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or of earth\u2019s gods. . . . There is unknown magic on Hatheg-Kla, for the screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter, and the slopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither I am plunging. . . . Hei! Hei! At last! In the dim light I behold the gods of earth!\u201d \u201cThe other gods! The other gods! The gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble gods of earth! . . . Look away! . . . Go back! . . . Do not see! . . . Do not see! . . . The vengeance of the infinite abysses . . . That cursed, that damnable pit . . . Merciful gods of earth, I am falling into the sky!\u201d And as Atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to jump downward against the frightful pull from unknown heights, there resounded on Hatheg-Kla that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses of Hatheg and Nir and Ulthar, and caused them to behold through the clouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted. And when the moon came out at last Atal was safe on the lower snows of the mountain without sight of earth\u2019s gods, or of the other gods.

However, a rumor spread in the village of Pwatuxet, about one mile downstream. There, the river flows oevr a rocky ledge in waterfalls, joining a calm, sheltered bay. Old, charming cottages climb the hill from the simple birdge. Fishing botas rest at their quiet docks. A vague story circulated about objects floating down the river. They became visible for a moment as they went over the falls. Of course, the Pawtuxet is a long river. It winds through many populated areas with many graveyards. Of course, the spring rains had been very heavy. The fishermen near the bridge did not like the wild look one of the things had as it fell to the still water below. They also did not like how another one seemed to half cry out, even though its state was very different from things that normally make sound. That rumor made Smith hurry to the riverabnk behind the farm. Weeden was away at sea at that time. Sure enough, signs of a large collaspe remained there. However, there was no sign of an entrance into the steep bank. The small landslide had left a solid wall of mixed earth and plants from above. Smith even tried some experimental digging. But he was stopped by a lack of success. Or perhaps he was stopped by fear of what success might mean. It is interesting to think about what the determined. Vengeful Weeden would have done if he had been on land then. By the autumn of 1770, Weeden decided the time was right to tell others about his discoveries. He had many facts to connect. He had a second eyewitness to rjeect any claim that jealousy. Spite had fueled his imagination. He chose Capt as his first trusted person. James Mathewson of the Enterprise knew him well enough not to doubt his truthfulness. On the other hand, he was important enough in the town for people to listen to him with respect. The conversation happened in an upper room of Sabin's Tavren near the docks. Smith was there to confirm almost every statement. It was clear that Capt. Mathewson was very strongly affected. Like almost everyone else in the town, he had his own dark suspicions about Joseph Curwen. Therefore, this confirmation and additional information were enough to convince him completely.\n###\nSomething was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out. That rumour sent Smith\u2014for Weeden was just then at sea\u2014in haste to the river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success\u2014or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time. By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabin\u2019s Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely."}

There was fruit that barrels were ordered for the crop. But with the ripening came disappointment. Out of all that display of deliciousness, not one bit was to eat. A bitterness. Sickly taste had crept into the flavor of the pears. the bite caused a lasting disgust. It was the with the melons and tomatoes. Nahum saw that his crop was lost. to connect events, he stated that the meteorite had poisoned the soil. He thanked heaven that of the crops were in the field along the road. Winter came and was. Ammi saw Nahum than. He noticed that Nahum had begun to look. The rest of his family seemed to have become. They were from in their church attendance. Their presence at the events of the countryside. No cause could be found for this quietness or sadness. All the household admitted. to health. A feeling of unease. Nahum himself gave the statement of anyone. He said he was disturbed abotu footprints in the snow. They were the winter prints of squirrels, rabbits, and foxes. The farmer claimed to see something not about their nature. He was. He seemed to think they were not of the body structure. Habits of squirrels, rabbits. Foxes as they should be. Ammi listened without interest to this talk. This continued until one night when he drove past Nahum 's house in his sleigh on the way from Clark 's Corners. There had been a moon. A rabbit had run across the road. The jumps of that rabbit were than either Ammi or his horse liked. The horse, in fact, had run before being controlled by a rein. Ammi gave Nahum 's stories respect. He wondered why the Gardner dogs seemed and shaking every morning. It turned out they had lost the spirit to bark. In February the McGregor boys from Meadow Hill were shooting woodchucks. Not from the Gardner place, they shot a specimen.\n###\nThe fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss, and in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the future crop. But with the ripening came sore disappointment; for of all that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was fit to eat. Into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept a stealthy bitterness and sickishness, so that even the smallest of bites induced a lasting disgust. It was the same with the melons and tomatoes, and Nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost. Quick to connect events, he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil, and thanked heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot along the road. Winter came early, and was very cold. Ammi saw Nahum less often than usual, and observed that he had begun to look worried. The rest of his family, too, seemed to have grown taciturn; and were far from steady in their churchgoing or their attendance at the various social events of the countryside. For this reserve or melancholy no cause could be found, though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health and a feeling of vague disquiet. Nahum himself gave the most definite statement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain footprints in the snow. They were the usual winter prints of red squirrels, white rabbits, and foxes, but the brooding farmer professed to see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement. He was never specific, but appeared to think that they were not as characteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and foxes as they ought to be. Ammi listened without interest to this talk until one night when he drove past Nahum\u2019s house in his sleigh on the way back from Clark\u2019s Corners. There had been a moon, and a rabbit had run across the road, and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than either Ammi or his horse liked. The latter, indeed, had almost run away when brought up by a firm rein. Thereafter Ammi gave Nahum\u2019s tales more respect, and wondered why the Gardner dogs seemed so cowed and quivering every morning. They had, it developed, nearly lost the spirit to bark. In February the McGregor boys from Meadow Hill were out shooting woodchucks, and not far from the Gardner place bagged a very peculiar specimen."}

Henderson, the famous cleaner, puts it in the week before, during the home's last day of rest. Tehn the glass suddenly changed from a state of acceptable clearenss to a state of hidden dullness. It refused to give a correct reflection because it had gathered a layer of much greater stickiness. This is surley supported by the window's changed look at that time. This is especially true by its constant gathering of unclear specks. Also, among the top corners was a certain lasting water stain left from a shower taken in October. This was the leftover of a mineral-heavy steam. He claims to have found some of its crystal marks behind the medicine cabinet in a very crack of the tiles, which the steam was known to have filled. It is, mostly, certain that the morning of that day saw a shift in glass. Because of this, it suddenly stopped its passive taking in of It started a hopeless fight against all cleaning products, both ordinary and unusual. This was varied only by this weirdly cosntant appearing of and unclear marks.\n###\nThe commencement of the mirror\u2019s befouling is a matter of dispute among domestic savants. Mrs. Henderson, the eminent housekeeper, places it in the week prior, during the household\u2019s final day of respite, when the glass abruptly turned from a state of tolerable clarity to a state of occult dimness, and refused to yield a proper reflection on the ground that it had accumulated a film of much greater tenacity. This is certainly borne out by the pane\u2019s altered aspect at the time, especially by its continual accretion of nebulous motes and among the upper corners a certain persistent watermark left from a shower taken in October; the residue of a mineral-heavy vapour, some of whose crystalline traces he professed to have found behind the medicine cabinet in a very old recess of the tiling, which the steam was known to have permeated and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the morning of that day saw a great change in the glass; whereby it abruptly ceased its passive reception of light and embarked on a desperate defiance of all cleansing agents both common and esoteric, varied only by this strangely persistent emergence of new and nebulous stains."}

Not even the physical horror of my position in that narrow hallway of dead reptiles. Ancient [THING] paintings could match the deadly dread I felt. I was miles below the world I knew. I faced another world of strange light and fog. The dread came from the extremely old age of the place and its spirit. Huge that measuring it seems weak seemed to look down from the first stones. [THING] - carved temples in the nameless [THING]. The very last of the amazing maps in the [THING] paintings showed oceans. Continents that [THING] has forgotten. Only here and there was some vaguely familiar shape. No [THING] could say what might have happened in the geological ages since the paintings stopped. No one could say since the death - hating race angrily gave in to decay. Life had once filled these caves and the glowing land beyond. Now I was alone with clear remains. I shook to think of the countless ages through wihch these remains had kept a silent. Suddenly there came another burst of that sharp fear. It had taken hold of me from time to time ever since I first saw the terrible valley. The nameless [THING] under a cold [THING]. Despite my tiredness, I found myself jumping up wildly to a sitting position. I stared back along the black hallway toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world. My feelings were much like those that had made me avoid the nameless [THING] at night. They were as hard to explain as they were strong. However, a moment later, I received an even greater shock. It came in the form of a clear sound. It was the first sound that had broken the complete silence of thees tomb - like depths. It was a deep, low moaning. It was like a distant crowd of condemned spirits. It came from the direction I was staring. Its sound quickly grew louder. Soon it echoed terribly through the low passage. At the same time, I became aware of a grwoing flow of cold air. It also came from the tunnels and the [THING] above. The touch of this air seemed to bring back my balance. I instantly remembered the sudden winds that had risen around the mouth of the deep hole each sunset. One of them had indeed helped show the hidden tunnels to me. I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near. So I prepared myself to resist the strong [THING]. It was sweeping down to its cave home as it had swept out at evening.\n###\nMy fears, indeed, concerned the past rather than the future. Not even the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes, miles below the world I knew and faced by another world of eerie light and mist, could match the lethal dread I felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul. An ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from the primal stones and rock-hewn temples in the nameless city, while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and continents that man has forgotten, with only here and there some vaguely familiar outline. Of what could have happened in the geological aeons since the paintings ceased and the death-hating race resentfully succumbed to decay, no man might say. Life had once teemed in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond; now I was alone with vivid relics, and I trembled to think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent and deserted vigil. Suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever since I first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon, and despite my exhaustion I found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world. My sensations were much like those which had made me shun the nameless city at night, and were as inexplicable as they were poignant. In another moment, however, I received a still greater shock in the form of a definite sound\u2014the first which had broken the utter silence of these tomb-like depths. It was a deep, low moaning, as of a distant throng of condemned spirits, and came from the direction in which I was staring. Its volume rapidly grew, till soon it reverberated frightfully through the low passage, and at the same time I became conscious of an increasing draught of cold air, likewise flowing from the tunnels and the city above. The touch of this air seemed to restore my balance, for I instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the abyss each sunset and sunrise, one of which had indeed served to reveal the hidden tunnels to me. I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near, so braced myself to resist the gale which was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening."}

It was no use telling the city people at Arkham, who laughed at everything. Thad was gone, and Merwin was gone. Something was spreading and waiting to be noticed. Nahum would leave. He wanted Ammi to care for his wife. Zenas if they outlived him. This must be some kind of punishment, though he could not think why, since he had lived as he knew. For than two weeks, Ammi saw nothing of Nahum., worried about what might have happened, he faced his fears. Visited the Gardner place. No smoke came from the chimney. For a moment visitor feared the.

Wood was needed, because the fireplace was., with soot blowing in the wind from the chimney. Nahum asked if the wood made him. Ammi saw what had occurred. The rope had snapped. The farmer 's mind could handle no grief. Questioning, Ammi could get no information about the Zenas. \" In the well \" was all the father would say. the visitor thought of the wife and changed his questions. \" Nabby? Why, she is! \" was the answer from Nahum. Ammi realized he must look for himself.\n###\nNahum was past imagining, Mrs. Pierce was blank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale, could give no guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling the people around, who shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in telling the city people at Arkham who laughed at everything. Thad was gone, and now Merwin was gone. Something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and felt and heard. Nahum would go soon, and he wanted Ammi to look after his wife and Zenas if they survived him. It must all be a judgment of some sort; though he could not fancy what for, since he had always walked uprightly in the Lord\u2019s ways so far as he knew. For over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about what might have happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner place a visit. There was no smoke from the great chimney, and for a moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst. The aspect of the whole farm was shocking\u2014greyish withered grass and leaves on the ground, vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and gables, and great bare trees clawing up at the grey November sky with a studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was alive, after all. He was weak, and lying on a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen, but perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to Zenas. The room was deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the host shouted huskily to Zenas for more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since the cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney. Presently Nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable, and then Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest cord had broken at last, and the hapless farmer\u2019s mind was proof against more sorrow. Questioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing Zenas. \u201cIn the well\u2014he lives in the well\u2014\u201d was all that the clouded father would say. Then there flashed across the visitor\u2019s mind a sudden thought of the mad wife, and he changed his line of inquiry. \u201cNabby? Why, here she is!\u201d was the surprised response of poor Nahum, and Ammi soon saw that he must search for himself."}

I have not failed in my duties to do so. The squire who inherited it in 1768 studied certain arts. He made certain discoveries. These were all linked to forces in this specific piece of land. They deserved the strongest protection. I now intend to show you some strange results of these arts and discoveries. I will do this in the strictest secrecy. I trust my judgment of people. I have no doubt about your interest or your loyalty.\" He stopped. I could only nod. I said I was alarmed. Yet to my soul, the ordinary daylight wrold of New York felt more deadly. Whether this man was a harmless odd person. A user of dangerous arts, I had no choice. I had to follow him. I had to satisfy my curiosity with whatever he might show. So I listened. \"To my ancestor,\" he continued softly, \"the human will seemed to have very remarkable qualities. These qaulities had an unsuspected power. This power was not only over one's own actions and the actions of others. It was also over every kind of force and subsatnce in Nature. It was over many elements and dimensions considered more universal than Nature itself. Should I say he mocked the sacredness of things as great as space and time? Should I say he used the rituals of certain mixed-blood red Indians in strange ways? Those people once camped on this hill. These Indians showed anger when the place was built. They were annoyingly persistent in asking to visit the grounds at the full moon. For years, they stole over the wall each month when they could. They secretly performed certain acts. Then, in 1768, the new squire caught them in the act. He stood still at what he saw. After that, he made a deal with them. He gave them free access to his grounds. In exchange, he learned the full details of what they did. He learned that their grandfathers got part of their practice from red ancestors. They got another part from an old Dutchman from the time of the States-General. And curse him, I fear the squire must have given them terribly bad rum. It might have been on purpose or not. A week after he learned the secret, he was the only living man who knew it.\n###\nThere were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family, and I have not been remiss in discharging such obligations. The squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding. Some curious effects of these arts and discoveries I now purpose to shew you, under the strictest secrecy; and I believe I may rely on my judgment of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelity.\u201d He paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was alarmed, yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of New York, and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts I had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to offer. So I listened. \u201cTo\u2014my ancestor\u2014\u201d he softly continued, \u201cthere appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a little-suspected dominance not only over the acts of one\u2019s self and of others, but over every variety of force and substance in Nature, and over many elements and dimensions deemed more univarsal than Nature herself. May I say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time, and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half-breed red Indians once encamped upon this hill? These Indians shewed choler when the place was built, and were plaguy pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon. For years they stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth performed sartain acts. Then, in \u201968, the new squire catched them at their doings, and stood still at what he saw. Thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did; larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old Dutchman in the time of the States-General. And pox on him, I\u2019m afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum\u2014whether or not by intent\u2014for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it."}

At the very bottom of the valley lies the river Than, whose waters are slimy and filled with weeds. From hidden springs it rises, and to subterranean grottoes it flows, so that the Daemon of the Valley knows not why its waters are red, nor whither they are bound. The Genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the Daemon of the Valley, saying, \u201cI am old, and forget much. Tell me the deeds and aspect and name of them who built these things of stone.\u201d And the Daemon replied, \u201cI am Memory, and am wise in lore of the past, but I too am old. These beings were like the waters of the river Than, not to be understood. Their deeds I recall not, for they were but of the moment. Their aspect I recall dimly, for it was like to that of the little apes in the trees. Their name I recall clearly, for it rhymed with that of the river. These beings of yesterday were called Man.\u201d Sheehan\u2019s Pool Room, which adorns one of the lesser alleys in the heart of Chicago\u2019s stockyard district, is not a nice place. Its air, freighted with a thousand odours such as Coleridge may have found at Cologne, too seldom knows the purifying rays of the sun; but fights for space with the acrid fumes of unnumbered cheap cigars and cigarettes which dangle from the coarse lips of unnumbered human animals that haunt the place day and night. But the popularity of Sheehan\u2019s remains unimpaired; and for this there is a reason\u2014a reason obvious to anyone who will take the trouble to analyse the mixed stenches prevailing there. Over and above the fumes and sickening closeness rises an aroma once familiar throughout the land, but now happily banished to the back streets of life by the edict of a benevolent government\u2014the aroma of strong, wicked whiskey\u2014a precious kind of forbidden fruit indeed in this year of grace 1950. Sheehan\u2019s is the acknowledged centre to Chicago\u2019s subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attach\u00e9s of the place; but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity\u2014one who shared the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of Sheehan\u2019s."}

Though they could survive in complete darkness like some night-growing fungi, they greatly preferred the harsh light from artificial sources. They tolerated the weak light of regular bulbs in private rooms. They loved the strong light of fluorescent tubes in public hallways. They put up light fixtures and kept the lighting systems working. They adjusted these with special dials that made odd humming sounds in some forgotten basements, which our maintenance crew had noticed. They handled normal shadows very well. In their best condition, tehy could operate with light as low as one lumen. When the deep dimness of evening arrivedthe people in the corridors had to use special methods like automatic sensors. Finally, the overwhelming darkness seems to have forced them back into their offices. Tradition syas that for their ancient watches during lonely nights, thye used some glowing chemicals. Became nearly free from switches, generators. By the time of the modern electrical grid, they had forgotten how to make that substance. Anyway, they could not have extended the artificial day forever without getting a strange, slow-spreading feeling of sickness.\n###\nThough capable, like certain nocturnal fungi, of subsisting in utter darkness; they vastly preferred the sterile glare of artificial illumination.

They installed fixtures and maintained lighting grids\u2014adjusting with calibrated dials whose peculiar hums in certain forgotten basements our maintenance crew had remarked. They withstood all ordinary shadows admirably; and in their perfected state could function in illumination down to a single lumen. When the great dimness of the evening drew on, however\u2014precisely at the appointed hour\u2014the corridor dwellers had to resort to special measures including automated sensors; until at last the engulfing gloom appears to have driven them back into their offices.

In any case they could not have prolonged the artificial day indefinitely without a peculiar, creeping malaise."}

It came from that unexplainable urge toward the northeast. The urge was mixed with derad and false memory. I walked slowly on under the bad, burning [THING]. Here and there I saw, half - covered by sand, those ancient Cyclopean blocks. They were left from unknown and forgotten ages. The unbelievable age. Lurking horror of this huge empty place began to crush me as never before. I could not stop thinking of my maddening dreams. I thought of the terrible stories behind them. I thought of the current fears of local [THING]. Miners about the desert. Its carved stones. And yet I walked on as if to some weird meeting. I was more and more attacked by confusing thoughts, strong urges, and false memories. I thought of some possible shapes of the [THING] lines my son saw from the air. I wondered why they seemed both so threatening and so familiar. Something was fumbling and rattling at the lock of my memory. At the same time, another unknown force tried to keep the [THING] closed. The night had no [THING]. The pale sand curved up and down like frozen [THING] waves. I had no goal. But somehow I pushed forward as if with a sure sense of fate. My dreams rose into the waking world. Each sand - covered large [THING] seemed part of endless rooms and halls. They were made of masonry from before humans. They were carved and marked with symbols. I knew these symbols too well from years of habit as a captive mind of the Great Race. At times I imagined I saw those all - knowing cone - shaped horrors moving about at their usual tasks. I was afraid to look down. I feared I would find myself looking like one of them. I saw the sand - covered blocks as well as the rooms. I saw the bad, burning [THING] as well as the lamps of glowing crystal. I saw the endless desert as well as the waving ferns. Cycads outside the windows. I was awake and dreaming at the same time. I do not know how long or how far I walked. I do not know in what direction I walked. This was wehn I first saw the pile of blocks uncovered by the day 's [THING]. It was the largest group in one place I had seen so far. It impressed me so sharply that the visions of amazing ages suddelny faded away. Again there were only the desert. The bad [THING]. The pieces of a past no one could guess.\n###\nNerves on edge, and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable, dread-mingled, pseudo-mnemonic urge toward the northeast, I plodded on beneath the evil, burning moon. Here and there I saw, half-shrouded by the sand, those primal Cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons. The incalculable age and brooding horror of this monstrous waste began to oppress me as never before, and I could not keep from thinking of my maddening dreams, of the frightful legends which lay behind them, and of the present fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stones. And yet I plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvous\u2014more and more assailed by bewildering fancies, compulsions, and pseudo-memories. I thought of some of the possible contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air, and wondered why they seemed at once so ominous and so familiar. Something was fumbling and rattling at the latch of my recollection, while another unknown force sought to keep the portal barred. The night was windless, and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves of the sea. I had no goal, but somehow ploughed along as if with fate-bound assurance. My dreams welled up into the waking world, so that each sand-embedded megalith seemed part of endless rooms and corridors of pre-human masonry, carved and hieroglyphed with symbols that I knew too well from years of custom as a captive mind of the Great Race. At moments I fancied I saw those omniscient conical horrors moving about at their accustomed tasks, and I feared to look down lest I find myself one with them in aspect. Yet all the while I saw the sand-covered blocks as well as the rooms and corridors; the evil, burning moon as well as the lamps of luminous crystal; the endless desert as well as the waving ferns and cycads beyond the windows. I was awake and dreaming at the same time. I do not know how long or how far\u2014or indeed, in just what direction\u2014I had walked when I first spied the heap of blocks bared by the day\u2019s wind. It was the largest group in one place that I had so far seen, and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away. Again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an unguessed past."}

By tonight I will be dead. Penniless, and I have run out of the drug that makes life bearable. I can stand the torture no longer. I will throw myself from this attic window into the dirty street below. Do not think my addiction to morphine means I am weak or corrupt. After you raed these quickly written pages, you may guess why I need forgetfulness. You will never fully understand. It was in one of the most open. Least traveled parts of the wide Pacific that the ship I was in charge of cargo on was captured by the German sea-raider. The great war was just starting then. The naval forces of the Hun had not yet fallen to their later low state. So our ship was taken as a legal prize. We, the crew, were treated with all the fairness due to naval prisoners. Our captors' rules were. Loose that five days after capture, I escaped alone in a small boat. I had water and supplies for a long time. When I found myself drifting and free, I knew little about my location. I was nveer a good navigator. I could only guess vaguely from the sun. Stars that I was somewhat south of the equtaor. I knew nothing of the longitude. No island or coastline was in sight. The weather stayed clear. For countless days I drifted aimlessly under the burning sun. I waited for a passing ship or to be washed onto some livable land. But neither ship nor land appeared. I began to lose hope in my loneliness on the huge, unbroken blue sea. The change happened while I slept. Its details I will never know. My sleep was troubled and full of dreams, but it was unbroken. When I finally woke up, I found myself half-sucked into a slimy stretch of awful black mud. It spread around me in endless, gentle waves as far as I could see. My boat was stuck some distance away in it. One might think my first feeling would be wonder at such a hug.e Sudden change of scenery. But I was actually more horrified than surprised. The rotting soil had a sinister quality that chilled me to my core.\n###\nI am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below. Do not think from my slavery to morphine that I am a weakling or a degenerate. When you have read these hastily scrawled pages you may guess, though never fully realise, why it is that I must have forgetfulness or death. It was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad Pacific that the packet of which I was supercargo fell a victim to the German sea-raider. The great war was then at its very beginning, and the ocean forces of the Hun had not completely sunk to their later degradation; so that our vessel was made a legitimate prize, whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as naval prisoners. So liberal, indeed, was the discipline of our captors, that five days after we were taken I managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time. When I finally found myself adrift and free, I had but little idea of my surroundings. Never a competent navigator, I could only guess vaguely by the sun and stars that I was somewhat south of the equator. Of the longitude I knew nothing, and no island or coast-line was in sight. The weather kept fair, and for uncounted days I drifted aimlessly beneath the scorching sun; waiting either for some passing ship, or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land. But neither ship nor land appeared, and I began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastnesses of unbroken blue. The change happened whilst I slept. Its details I shall never know; for my slumber, though troubled and dream-infested, was continuous. When at last I awaked, it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about me in monotonous undulations as far as I could see, and in which my boat lay grounded some distance away. Though one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wonder at so prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery, I was in reality more horrified than astonished; for there was in the air and in the rotting soil a sinister quality which chilled me to the very core."}

I bent down and pulled the things out of the grave. We both worked hard to make the place look like it did before. This made us very nervous. The stiff body and empty face of our first find especially did. But we managed to remove all signs of our visit. We patted down the last shovelful of earth. Then we put the body in a canvas sack. We went to the old Chapman place beyond Meadow Hill. We used an old farmhouse table as a dissecting table. A strong acetylene lamp gave light. The body did not look very ghostly. It had been a strong youth of a common, healthy type. He was lrage, with grey eyes and brown hair. He was simple, physical person without complex thoughts. His bodily processes were likely very simple and healthy. Now, with his eyes clsoed, he looked more asleep than dead. But my friend's expert tests soon showed he was truly dead. We finally had what West had always wanted. We had a real dead man of the perfect kind. He was ready for the solution. This solution was prepared with great care and theory for use on humans. Our tension became very great. We knew there was little chance for complete success. We could not avoid horrible fears. We feared possible grotesque results from partial revival. Especially were we worried about the creature's mind and impulse.s This is because some delicate brain cells might have decayed after death. I myself still held some strange ideas about the traditional human \"soul\". I felt awe at the secrets one returning from the dead might tell. I wondered what sights this calm youth might have seen in unreachable places. I wondered what he could tell if fully brought back to life. But my wonder was not too strong. This is because I mostly shared my friend's materialist views. He was calmer than I was. He forced a large amount of his fluid into a vein in the body's arm. He immediately tied the cut securely. The waiting was horrible, but West never hesitated. Every so often he used his stethoscope on the body. He accepted the negative results calmly. After about forty-five minutes with no sign of life, he said the solution was not good enough. He was disappointed. But he decided to use his chance fully. He would try one change in the formula before getting rid of his awful prize.\n###\nI reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave, and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance. The affair made us rather nervous, especially the stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy, but we managed to remove all traces of our visit. When we had patted down the last shovelful of earth we put the specimen in a canvas sack and set out for the old Chapman place beyond Meadow Hill. On an improvised dissecting-table in the old farmhouse, by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp, the specimen was not very spectral looking. It had been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian type\u2014large-framed, grey-eyed, and brown-haired\u2014a sound animal without psychological subtleties, and probably having vital processes of the simplest and healthiest sort. Now, with the eyes closed, it looked more asleep than dead; though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score. We had at last what West had always longed for\u2014a real dead man of the ideal kind, ready for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use. The tension on our part became very great. We knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like complete success, and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation. Especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the creature, since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might well have suffered deterioration. I, myself, still held some curious notions about the traditional \u201csoul\u201d of man, and felt an awe at the secrets that might be told by one returning from the dead. I wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres, and what he could relate if fully restored to life. But my wonder was not overwhelming, since for the most part I shared the materialism of my friend. He was calmer than I as he forced a large quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body\u2019s arm, immediately binding the incision securely. The waiting was gruesome, but West never faltered. Every now and then he applied his stethoscope to the specimen, and bore the negative results philosophically. After about three-quarters of an hour without the least sign of life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate, but determined to make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before disposing of his ghastly prize."}

Tehy see the light of the windows peeking out from under those eaves in the dusk. These summer people do not believe the person has lived in the house for hundreds of years. But they can not prove their belief to any Kingsporter. the Terrible Old Man who talks to lead weights in bottles, buys food with gold coins. Keeps stone statues in the yard of his cottage in Water Street can say these things were when his grandfather was a boy. That must have been an time. It was when Belcher. Bernard was Governor of His Majesty 's Province of the Massachusetts - Bay. one summer, a philosopher came to Kingsport.

The sea become wtih the smoke of steamships, he would sigh. Go down to the town., he loved to walk through the streets and down the hill. He liked to study the leaning roof peaks and doorways with pillars.

The ancient house has always been there, and people say One dwells therein who talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep, and perhaps sees singular things oceanward at those times when the cliff\u2019s rim becomes the rim of all earth, and solemn buoys toll free in the white aether of faery. This they tell from hearsay, for that forbidding crag is always unvisited, and natives dislike to train telescopes on it. Summer boarders have indeed scanned it with jaunty binoculars, but have never seen more than the grey primeval roof, peaked and shingled, whose eaves come nearly to the grey foundations, and the dim yellow light of the little windows peeping out from under those eaves in the dusk. These summer people do not believe that the same One has lived in the ancient house for hundreds of years, but cannot prove their heresy to any real Kingsporter. Even the Terrible Old Man who talks to leaden pendulums in bottles, buys groceries with centuried Spanish gold, and keeps stone idols in the yard of his antediluvian cottage in Water Street can only say these things were the same when his grandfather was a boy, and that must have been inconceivable ages ago, when Belcher or Shirley or Pownall or Bernard was Governor of His Majesty\u2019s Province of the Massachusetts-Bay. Then one summer there came a philosopher into Kingsport. His name was Thomas Olney, and he taught ponderous things in a college by Narragansett Bay. With stout wife and romping children he came, and his eyes were weary with seeing the same things for many years, and thinking the same well-disciplined thoughts. He looked at the mists from the diadem of Father Neptune, and tried to walk into their white world of mystery along the titan steps of The Causeway. Morning after morning he would lie on the cliffs and look over the world\u2019s rim at the cryptical aether beyond, listening to spectral bells and the wild cries of what might have been gulls. Then, when the mist would lift and the sea stand out prosy with the smoke of steamers, he would sigh and descend to the town, where he loved to thread the narrow olden lanes up and down hill, and study the crazy tottering gables and odd pillared doorways which had sheltered so many generations of sturdy sea-folk."}

There were instruments made of string, brass, and wood. St. John and I played them, creaitng sounds of sickness and horror. In ebony cabinets rested the. variety of stolen items from graves. This collection was put by mdaness and desire. I must not speak of this loot in detail. Thank God I had the courage to destroy it before I thought of killing myself. Our hunting trips to collect our treasures were events. We were not robbers. We worked under conditions of mood, scenery, surroundings, weather, season, and moonlight. These activities were to us the form of expression. We paid attention to their details. A hour, a effect. A handling of the soil woudl riun for us that thrilling excitement. This excitement came after digging up some, grinning secret from the earth. Our search for scenes and conditions was and. St. John was the leader. He was the one who led the way to that mocking, that cursed place. This place brought us our and fate. By what fate were we drawn to that Holland churcyhard? I think it was the rumors and legends. The tales spoke of someone buried for five centuries. This person had himself been a robber in his time. He had stolen a object from a tomb. I can remember the scene in those moments. The autumn moon was over the graves, casting shadows. The trees hung to meet the grass and the stone slabs. armies of bats flew against the moon. The ivy - covered church pointde a finger at the sky. Glowing insects danced like corpse - lights under the yew trees in a corner. Smells of decay, plants. things mixed with the night wind from swamps. of all was the, - howling of some dog. We could see it nor tell where it was. As we heard this hint of howling we shook with fear, remembering the stories of the people. For the man we looked for had been found in this spot centuries. He was ripped and torn by the claws and teeth of some animal.\n###\nA locked portfolio, bound in tanned human skin, held certain unknown and unnamable drawings which it was rumoured Goya had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge. There were nauseous musical instruments, stringed, brass, and wood-wind, on which St. John and I sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and cacodaemoniacal ghastliness; whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony cabinets reposed the most incredible and unimaginable variety of tomb-loot ever assembled by human madness and perversity. It is of this loot in particular that I must not speak\u2014thank God I had the courage to destroy it long before I thought of destroying myself. The predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable treasures were always artistically memorable events. We were no vulgar ghouls, but worked only under certain conditions of mood, landscape, environment, weather, season, and moonlight. These pastimes were to us the most exquisite form of aesthetic expression, and we gave their details a fastidious technical care. An inappropriate hour, a jarring lighting effect, or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod, would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the exhumation of some ominous, grinning secret of the earth. Our quest for novel scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiate\u2014St. John was always the leader, and he it was who led the way at last to that mocking, that accursed spot which brought us our hideous and inevitable doom. By what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible Holland churchyard? I think it was the dark rumour and legendry, the tales of one buried for five centuries, who had himself been a ghoul in his time and had stolen a potent thing from a mighty sepulchre. I can recall the scene in these final moments\u2014the pale autumnal moon over the graves, casting long horrible shadows; the grotesque trees, drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs; the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon; the antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky; the phosphorescent insects that danced like death-fires under the yews in a distant corner; the odours of mould, vegetation, and less explicable things that mingled feebly with the night-wind from over far swamps and seas; and worst of all, the faint deep-toned baying of some gigantic hound which we could neither see nor definitely place. As we heard this suggestion of baying we shuddered, remembering the tales of the peasantry; for he whom we sought had centuries before been found in this selfsame spot, torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some unspeakable beast."}

Science journals, as I mostly had to do. I was in control of my money. I spent it slowly and mostly wisely on travel and study at different schools. My travels, however, were very unusual. They involved long stays in faraway and empty places. In 1909, I spent a month in the Himalayas. In 1911, I got much attention by taking a camel trip into the unknown deserts of Arabia. I have never been able to learn what happened on those trips. In the summer of 1912, I hired a ship. Sailed in the Arctic north of Spitzbergen. After that, I showed signs of being disappointed. Later that year, I spent weeks alone in the huge limestone cave systems of western Virginia. These were beyond where anyone had explored bfeore or after. The cvaes were black mazes. Complicated that I could not even tihnk about finding my way back. My stays at universities were marked by very fast learning. It was as if the second personality had a mind much smarter thna my own. I also found that my speed of reading and studying alone was amazing. I could learn every detail of a book just by looking over it as fast as I could turn the pages. My skill at understanding complex numbers instantly was truly impressive. At times, there were almost bad reports about my power to affect the thoughts. Actions of others. But I seemed to have tried to limit showing this ability. Other bad reports were about my closeness with leaders of occult groups. They also concerned scholars suspected of links to horrible secret groups of ancient priests. These rumors were never proven at the time. They were likely encouraged by the known nature of some of my reading. Looking at rare books in libraries cannot be done in secret. There is solid proof in the form of notes in the margins. These show I carefully read things like the Comte d\u2019Erlette\u2019s Cultes des Goules, Ludvig Prinn\u2019s De Vermis Mysteriis, the Unaussprechlichen Kuletn of von Junzt, the remaining pieces of the confusing Book of Eibon. The feared Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. Also, it is clear that a new. Evil waev of secret cult activity started around the time of my strange change.\n###\nI will not attempt to tell much of my life from 1908 to 1913, since readers may glean all the outward essentials\u2014as I largely had to do\u2014from files of old newspapers and scientific journals. I was given charge of my funds, and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely, in travel and in study at various centres of learning. My travels, however, were singular in the extreme; involving long visits to remote and desolate places. In 1909 I spent a month in the Himalayas, and in 1911 aroused much attention through a camel trip into the unknown deserts of Arabia. What happened on those journeys I have never been able to learn. During the summer of 1912 I chartered a ship and sailed in the Arctic north of Spitzbergen, afterward shewing signs of disappointment. Later in that year I spent weeks alone beyond the limits of previous or subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western Virginia\u2014black labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be considered. My sojourns at the universities were marked by abnormally rapid assimilation, as if the secondary personality had an intelligence enormously superior to my own. I have found, also, that my rate of reading and solitary study was phenomenal. I could master every detail of a book merely by glancing over it as fast as I could turn the leaves; while my skill at interpreting complex figures in an instant was veritably awesome. At times there appeared almost ugly reports of my power to influence the thoughts and acts of others, though I seemed to have taken care to minimise displays of this faculty. Other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups, and scholars suspected of connexion with nameless bands of abhorrent elder-world hierophants. These rumours, though never proved at the time, were doubtless stimulated by the known tenor of some of my reading\u2014for the consultation of rare books at libraries cannot be effected secretly. There is tangible proof\u2014in the form of marginal notes\u2014that I went minutely through such things as the Comte d\u2019Erlette\u2019s Cultes des Goules, Ludvig Prinn\u2019s De Vermis Mysteriis, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, the surviving fragments of the puzzling Book of Eibon, and the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. Then, too, it is undeniable that a fresh and evil wave of underground cult activity set in about the time of my odd mutation."}

But madness pushed me. I picked a spot near the wall. the crack was. The landing area was of rubble. After one moment, I reached the side. reaching the level, I stumbled past the archway of the room with machines. were ruins of metal buried under fallen ceiling. Everything was where I knew it would be. I climbed over the piles blocking the entrance to a crosswise hallway. This, I knew, would take me under the city to the archives. ages seemed to unfold as I stumbled, jumped, and crawled along that debris - filled hallway. I could see carvings on the stained walls. Some were, others seemed added since the time of my dreams. Snice this was an road connecting houses, there were no archways except where the path went through the levels of buildings. At some of these crossings I turned to look down - remembered halls. Into - remembered rooms. did I find any changes from what I had dreamed. In one of these cases, I could see the sealed - up outline of the archway I remembered. I shook and felt a wave of slowing weakness. I moved. through the crypt of one of those ruined towers with no windows. Its stonework hinted at a and origin. This vault was and a two hundred feet. Nothing was carved on the - colored stone. The floor was of anything except dust and sand. I could see the openings leading and. There were no stairs or slopes., my dreams had shown those towers by the Great Race. Those who built them had not needed stairs or slopes. In the dreams, the opening had been sealed and guarded. it lay. It was and, and it gave out a flow of, air. I would not let myself think about what caves of night might wait.\n###\nBy the time of the post-human beetle race it would be quite dead. And yet, as I thought of the native legends, I trembled anew. It cost me a terrible effort to vault that yawning chasm, since the littered floor prevented a running start\u2014but madness drove me on. I chose a place close to the left-hand wall\u2014where the rift was least wide and the landing-spot reasonably clear of dangerous debris\u2014and after one frantic moment reached the other side in safety. At last gaining the lower level, I stumbled on past the archway of the room of machines, within which were fantastic ruins of metal half-buried beneath fallen vaulting. Everything was where I knew it would be, and I climbed confidently over the heaps which barred the entrance of a vast transverse corridor. This, I realised, would take me under the city to the central archives. Endless ages seemed to unroll as I stumbled, leaped, and crawled along that debris-cluttered corridor. Now and then I could make out carvings on the age-stained walls\u2014some familiar, others seemingly added since the period of my dreams. Since this was a subterrene house-connecting highway, there were no archways save when the route led through the lower levels of various buildings. At some of these intersections I turned aside long enough to look down well-remembered corridors and into well-remembered rooms. Twice only did I find any radical changes from what I had dreamed of\u2014and in one of these cases I could trace the sealed-up outlines of the archway I remembered. I shook violently, and felt a curious surge of retarding weakness, as I steered a hurried and reluctant course through the crypt of one of those great windowless ruined towers whose alien basalt masonry bespoke a whispered and horrible origin. This primal vault was round and fully two hundred feet across, with nothing carved upon the dark-hued stonework. The floor was here free from anything save dust and sand, and I could see the apertures leading upward and downward. There were no stairs or inclines\u2014indeed, my dreams had pictured those elder towers as wholly untouched by the fabulous Great Race. Those who had built them had not needed stairs or inclines. In the dreams, the downward aperture had been tightly sealed and nervously guarded. Now it lay open\u2014black and yawning, and giving forth a current of cool, damp air. Of what limitless caverns of eternal night might brood below, I would not permit myself to think."}

The setup looked like the ruins of Machu Picchu in the Andes. The foundation walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford \u2013 Field Museum Expeditoin in 1929. Both Danforth and I got the impression of blocks. Lake had credited this impression to his flight companion Carroll. How to explain things was beyond me. I felt as a geologist. formations have regularities, like the Giants ' Causeway in Ireland. This mountain range was not in structure, despite Lake 's suspicion of smoking cones. The cave openings presented another, puzzle because of their shape. They were or, as Lake 's report spoke. It was as if holes had been shaped into symmetry by some hand. Their number and spread were. This suggested the area was of tunnels dissolved from limestone layers. Our looks did not go into caves. We saw they seemed of stalactites., the parts of the mountain slopes near the openings seemed and. Danforth thought the cracks and pits from weathering tended to form patterns. Filled as he was with the horrors. Strangeness found at the camp, he hinted that the pits resembled those groups of dots on the soapstones. These dots were copied on the snow mounds above those six buried monsters. We had climbed. Flying oevr the foothills. Toward the pass we had chosen. As we went, we looked down at the snow. Ice of the land route. We wondered if we could have tride the trip with the equipment of times. to our surprise, we saw the land was not for terrain. Despite the crevasses. spots, it would not have stopped the sledges of Scott, a Shackleton. Some glaciers seemed to lead up to wind - cleared passes with smoothness. When we reached our chosen pass, we found it was no exception.\n###\nThe whole arrangement looked like the ruins of Machu Picchu in the Andes, or the primal foundation-walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford\u2013Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I obtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which Lake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll. How to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and I felt queerly humbled as a geologist. Igneous formations often have strange regularities\u2014like the famous Giants\u2019 Causeway in Ireland\u2014but this stupendous range, despite Lake\u2019s original suspicion of smoking cones, was above all else non-volcanic in evident structure. The curious cave-mouths, near which the odd formations seemed most abundant, presented another albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of outline. They were, as Lake\u2019s bulletin had said, often approximately square or semicircular; as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand. Their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable, and suggested that the whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata. Such glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns, but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites. Outside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures seemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the slight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual patterns. Filled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp, he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones, so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six buried monstrosities. We had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the relatively low pass we had selected. As we advanced we occasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route, wondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days. Somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a Shackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to wind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exception."}

The connection between the. homes was made through slopes. Upgrades along the connecting paths. This included carving tunnels from the city to the hole. These tunnels pointed. We marked their openings on the map we were making, based on our guesses. It was that two of these tunnels were within a exploring distance from our location. Both were on the city edge toward the mountain. One was than a quarter - mile toward the river path. The was that distance in the direction. The hole, it seems, had sloping shores of land in some places. But the Old Ones built their city under water. This was no doutb because it offered certainty of warmth. The depth of the sea appears to have been. the earth 's heat could keep it for a time. The beings seem to have had no trouble adapting to part - time. - time, life under water. They had let their gill systems weaken. sculptures showed how they had visited their relatives in places. They showed how they had bathed on the bottom of their river. The darkness inside the earth could have been no barrier to a race used to nights. though their style was, these carvings had a quality when they told of building the city in the cave sea. The Old Ones had gone about it. They quraried rocks from the heart of the mountains of holes. They hired workers from the city to do the construction using the methods. These wrokers brought all that was needed to start the project. They brought - tissue to breed stone - lifters and beasts of burden for the cave city. They brought living matter to shape into glowing organisms for light. At a city rose on the bottom of that sea. Its architecture was like the city. Its work showed decline because buildnig work has a nature. The bred shoggoths grew to size and intelligence. They were shown taking and carrying out orders with speed.\n###\nThe linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by means of several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes, including the chiselling of numerous direct tunnels from the ancient metropolis to the black abyss\u2014sharply down-pointing tunnels whose mouths we carefully drew, according to our most thoughtful estimates, on the guide map we were compiling. It was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a reasonable exploring distance of where we were; both being on the mountainward edge of the city, one less than a quarter-mile toward the ancient river-course, and the other perhaps twice that distance in the opposite direction. The abyss, it seems, had shelving shores of dry land at certain places; but the Old Ones built their new city under water\u2014no doubt because of its greater certainty of uniform warmth. The depth of the hidden sea appears to have been very great, so that the earth\u2019s internal heat could ensure its habitability for an indefinite period. The beings seem to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to part-time\u2014and eventually, of course, whole-time\u2014residence under water; since they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy. There were many sculptures which shewed how they had always frequently visited their submarine kinsfolk elsewhere, and how they had habitually bathed on the deep bottom of their great river. The darkness of inner earth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to long antarctic nights. Decadent though their style undoubtedly was, these latest carvings had a truly epic quality where they told of the building of the new city in the cavern sea. The Old Ones had gone about it scientifically; quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the honeycombed mountains, and employing expert workers from the nearest submarine city to perform the construction according to the best methods. These workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish the new venture\u2014shoggoth-tissue from which to breed stone-lifters and subsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city, and other protoplasmic matter to mould into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes. At last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that Stygian sea; its architecture much like that of the city above, and its workmanship displaying relatively little decadence because of the precise mathematical element inherent in building operations. The newly bred shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular intelligence, and were represented as taking and executing orders with marvellous quickness."}

The loaf became veyr hrad. Old-fashioned food lovers remembered what softness had once been prat of its shape. Betwixt the crust and the inside crumb, a terrible split appeared. The brittle pieces from the outside were different from the leathery, dried sponge. There were cracks and crystal shapes and unknown grains and all things of misery. Those who dare to look at such forgotten foods know these things. So the bread became firm and stiff and ugly. It sent out conquering dryness to defeat the nearby pastries. In time, a king ruled on the pantry shelf. It ruled all the kingdom of staleness and of many baked goods nearby.\n###\nAfter the initial desiccation there were many subsequent days of neglect, but never was the original moist crumb restored. And many hours came and went, wherein the loaf hardened exceedingly, so that only bakers and antiquated gourmands remembered what suppleness had once characterised its form. Betwixt the crust and the inner crumb arose a terrible dichotomy, and the brittle shards from the exterior were contrasted with the leathery, desiccated sponge and fissures and crystalline structures and unnameable granules and all things of wretchedness that are known to those who dare examine such forgotten comestibles. So the bread waxed firm and unyielding and grotesque, and sent forth conquering dryness to subdue the neighbouring pastries; and in time there reigned upon the larder shelf a monarch of all the realm of staleness and of many baked goods adjacent."}

For some time there had been a release of, smells from the church. This had become and. at there was a sound of wood breaking. A, object crashed down in the yard under the front. The tower was that the candles would not burn. As the object neared the ground, the people knew it was the smoke - blackened boarding of that tower 's east window.\n###\nIt happened at 2:12 a.m. according to power-house records, but Blake\u2019s diary gives no indication of the time. The entry is merely, \u201cLights out\u2014God help me.\u201d On Federal Hill there were watchers as anxious as he, and rain-soaked knots of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with umbrella-shaded candles, electric flashlights, oil lanterns, crucifixes, and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern Italy. They blessed each flash of lightning, and made cryptical signs of fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether. A rising wind blew out most of the candles, so that the scene grew threateningly dark. Someone roused Father Merluzzo of Spirito Santo Church, and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could. Of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower, there could be no doubt whatever. For what happened at 2:35 we have the testimony of the priest, a young, intelligent, and well-educated person; of Patrolman William J. Monahan of the Central Station, an officer of the highest reliability who had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd; and of most of the seventy-eight men who had gathered around the church\u2019s high bank wall\u2014especially those in the square where the eastward facade was visible. Of course there was nothing which can be proved as being outside the order of Nature. The possible causes of such an event are many. No one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes arising in a vast, ancient, ill-aired, and long-deserted building of heterogeneous contents. Mephitic vapours\u2014spontaneous combustion\u2014pressure of gases born of long decay\u2014any one of numberless phenomena might be responsible. And then, of course, the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded. The thing was really quite simple in itself, and covered less than three minutes of actual time. Father Merluzzo, always a precise man, looked at his watch repeatedly. It started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the black tower. There had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange, evil odours from the church, and this had now become emphatic and offensive. Then at last there was a sound of splintering wood, and a large, heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly facade. The tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn, but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was the smoke-grimed louver-boarding of that tower\u2019s east window."}

The Plaaeozoic age waas changing to the Mesozoic age. bodies used by the Great Race did not come from any surviving line of Earth evolution. Science does not know them. They were a special, very similar, and highly developed organic type. They were as much platn as animla. Movement was of a unique kind. It almost prevented tiredness. It completely removed the need for sleep. Food was taken in through red, trumpet-like parts on one of the large, flexible limbs. It was always partly liquid. In many ways, it was completely unlike the food of current animals. The beings had only two senses we know: sight and hearing. Hearring was done through flower-like parts on the grey stalks above their heads. They had many other, hard-to-understand senses. However, these were not easy for captive minds from elsewhere to use. Their three eyes were placed to give them a wider view than normal. Their blood was a kind of deep greenish, very thick fluid. They had no sex. They reproduceed through seeds or spores. These gathered on their bases and could grow only under water. Therefore, shallow tanks were uesd for growing their young. However, theyy raised only a few young because individuals lived so long. Four or fiev thousand years was the common life span.\n###\nThe period of my dreams, apparently, was one somewhat less than 150,000,000 years ago, when the Palaeozoic age was giving place to the Mesozoic. The bodies occupied by the Great Race represented no surviving\u2014or even scientifically known\u2014line of terrestrial evolution, but were of a peculiar, closely homogeneous, and highly specialised organic type inclining as much to the vegetable as to the animal state. Cell-action was of an unique sort almost precluding fatigue, and wholly eliminating the need of sleep. Nourishment, assimilated through the red trumpet-like appendages on one of the great flexible limbs, was always semi-fluid and in many aspects wholly unlike the food of existing animals. The beings had but two of the senses which we recognise\u2014sight and hearing, the latter accomplished through the flower-like appendages on the grey stalks above their heads\u2014but of other and incomprehensible senses (not, however, well utilisable by alien captive minds inhabiting their bodies) they possessed many. Their three eyes were so situated as to give them a range of vision wider than the normal. Their blood was a sort of deep-greenish ichor of great thickness. They had no sex, but reproduced through seeds or spores which clustered on their bases and could be developed only under water. Great, shallow tanks were used for the growth of their young\u2014which were, however, reared only in small numbers on account of the longevity of individuals; four or five thousand years being the common life span."}

Carter, who had been given that task, slipped the end of the gravestone into the opening. a heaving effort began. But progress was., they had to return to their starting position each time they failed to turn the slab. Prop the door. their desperation increased a thousand times because of a sound on the steps below them. It was the thumping. Rattling of the ghast 's bdoy as it rolled down to levels. But among all reasons for the body becoming and, none was comforting., knowing the ways of gugs, the ghouls worked with a kind of frenzy. In a time, they had the door. They held it while Carter turned the slab, leaving a opening. They helped Carter through. They let him climb onto their shoulders. they guided his feet as he grabbed the soil of the dreamland. Another and they were through themselves. They knocked the gravestone and closed the trap - door while panting became beneath. Because of the Great Ones ' curse, no gug could come out from that door. With relief. A sense of rest, Carter lay on the, fungi of the enchanted wood. His guides squatted in the way ghouls rest. as was that enchanted wood through which he had traveled., it was a haven. A delight after the places he had left. No living creature was, for zoogs avoid the door in fear. Carter talked with his ghouls about their path. They dared to return through the tower. The waking world did not attract them when they learned they must pass the priests Nasth. Kamna - Thah in the cavern of flaem. they decided to return through Sarkomand and its gate of the abyss., they knew nothing about how to get. Carter remembered that it lies in the valley below Leng. He remembered that he had seen in Dylath - Leen a sinister, - merchant. This merchant was said to trade on Leng.\n###\nAfter a few moments a crack of light appeared; and Carter, to whom that task had been entrusted, slipped the end of the old gravestone in the aperture. There now ensued a mighty heaving; but progress was very slow, and they had of course to return to their first position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal open. Suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousandfold by a sound on the steps below them. It was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghast\u2019s hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels; but of all the possible causes of that body\u2019s dislodgment and rolling, none was in the least reassuring. Therefore, knowing the ways of gugs, the ghouls set to with something of a frenzy; and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst Carter turned the slab and left a generous opening. They now helped Carter through, letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside. Another second and they were through themselves, knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trap-door while a panting became audible beneath. Because of the Great Ones\u2019 curse no gug might ever emerge from that portal, so with a deep relief and sense of repose Carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls rest. Weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago, it was verily a haven and a delight after the gulfs he had now left behind. There was no living denizen about, for zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear, and Carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their future course. To return through the tower they no longer dared, and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in the cavern of flame. So at length they decided to return through Sarkomand and its gate of the abyss, though of how to get there they knew nothing.

It was a sight to see those faceless, ticklers at their activity. It was to watch the cloud of them spreading through the town. They went up the winding roadway to the areas. a group of the flutterers would drop a toad - prisoner from by accident. The way the victim would burst was to see and smell.\n###\nThey did not, of course, realise that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved almost-humans, and the night-gaunts were all out of sight below. By this time the leaders had fully formed a plan; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon as the wharf was touched, and then to sail directly away, leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those almost mindless creatures. Marooned on the rock, the horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there, and afterward, quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct, would forget their fear of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark, from which not much would emerge alive. The ghoul that was Pickman now went below and gave the night-gaunts their simple instructions, while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves. Presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront, and Carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion. Evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock, and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the almost-human slaves whose places they were taking. Some silent alarm must have been given, for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moon-beasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right. A rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf, felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another; but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring night-gaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and Cyclopean bats. The jellyish moon-beasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading ship, but when the night-gaunts struck them they thought of such things no more. It was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime, and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches above. Sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toad-like prisoner from aloft by mistake, and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell."}

As Charles picked up his and left the room, Mr. Ward knew what to make of the business. It was as the death of Nig. His body had been found an hour in the basement. His eyes were staring and his mouth twisted with fear. Driven by some detective instinct, the parent glanced at the shelves. He wanted to see what his son had taken to the attic. The man 's library was and organized. One could tell at a glance which books. At what kind of books, had been taken. This time, Mr. Ward was to find nothing occult. Antique was missing, beyond what had been taken. These withdrawals were all items. They were histories, writings, geographies, literature manuals, philosophy works. newspapers. This was a change from Charles Ward 's reading habits. The father paused, growing and feeling a sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a feeling.

For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth. Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youth\u2019s library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Ward\u2019s recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was. On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the room\u2019s last cleaning the worst had happened."}

Play on the hills. Talk with shadows. among that line of things Carter heard their, cry. Thougth of the roofs. lighted windows of home. of the talk of cats was known to Randolph Carter. In this, place he made the cry that was. That he did not need to do, for as his lips opened he heard the group sound grow. Saw shadows against the stars as shapes jumped from hill to hill in gathering armies. The call of the group had been given. Before the line had time to be scared a cloud of fur. A line of killing claws were upon it like a tide. The flutes stopped, and there were screams in the night. Dying - humans screamed.

Pull it down to the fungus plain, where thousands of their friends would flow over it. Into it with the claws. Teeth of a battle - anger. Carter had taken a torch from a slave. Was overcome by the moving waves of his protectors. he lay in the blackness hearing the noise of war. The shouts of the winners. Feeling the feet of his friends as they rushed. over him in the fight.

The shining circle of the earth, thirteen times than that of the moon as we see it, had risen with floods of light over the moon land. Across all those miles of area. top sat one sea of cats in order.\n###\nVerily, it is to the moon\u2019s dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse with ancient shadows, and here amidst that column of foetid things Carter heard their homely, friendly cry, and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home. Now much of the speech of cats was known to Randolph Carter, and in this far, terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable. But that he need not have done, for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer, and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions. The call of the clan had been given, and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it. The flutes stopped, and there were shrieks in the night. Dying almost-humans screamed, and cats spit and yowled and roared, but the toad-things made never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungi. It was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted, and Carter had never before seen so many cats. Black, grey, and white; yellow, tiger, and mixed; common, Persian, and Manx; Thibetan, Angora, and Egyptian; all were there in the fury of battle, and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of Bubastis. They would leap seven strong at the throat of an almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain, where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine battle-fury. Carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave, but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders. Then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors, and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray. At last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it was upon a strange scene. The great shining disc of the earth, thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it, had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape; and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array."}

This belief made me think about. I considered communication using tools. In my college days, I built a set of instruments. They were for transmitting and receiving. They were like the telegraphy devices of thta time. That was a period before radio. I tested these with another student. We achievde no results. I packed them. They were stored with items. I kept them for use. I wanted to probe Joe Slater 's dream life. I looked for these instruments. I spent days repairing them for use. When they were, I tried them at every chance. At each outburst of Slater \u2019s violence, I would act. I fit the transmitter to his forehead. I fit the receiver to my forehead. I made adjustments. I adjusted for wavelengths of energy. I had idea how thought - impressions would work. If sent, they might arouse an response in my brain. But I felt I could detect and interpret them. I continued my experiments. I told no one about their nature. The thing happened on the twenty - firts of February, 1901. As I look across the years, I realize how it seems. I wonder if Dr. Fenton was not.

This was if he woke in disorder before passing.\n###\nIt had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion, convertible into ether waves of radiant energy like heat, light, and electricity. This belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus, and I had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude, pre-radio period. These I had tested with a fellow-student; but achieving no result, had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible future use. Now, in my intense desire to probe into the dream life of Joe Slater, I sought these instruments again; and spent several days in repairing them for action. When they were complete once more I missed no opportunity for their trial. At each outburst of Slater\u2019s violence, I would fit the transmitter to his forehead and the receiver to my own; constantly making delicate adjustments for various hypothetical wave-lengths of intellectual energy. I had but little notion of how the thought-impressions would, if successfully conveyed, arouse an intelligent response in my brain; but I felt certain that I could detect and interpret them. Accordingly I continued my experiments, though informing no one of their nature. It was on the twenty-first of February, 1901, that the thing finally occurred. As I look back across the years I realise how unreal it seems; and sometimes half wonder if old Dr. Fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited imagination. I recall that he listened with great kindness and patience when I told him, but afterward gave me a nerve-powder and arranged for the half-year\u2019s vacation on which I departed the next week. That fateful night I was wildly agitated and perturbed, for despite the excellent care he had received, Joe Slater was unmistakably dying. Perhaps it was his mountain freedom that he missed, or perhaps the turmoil in his brain had grown too acute for his rather sluggish physique; but at all events the flame of vitality flickered low in the decadent body. He was drowsy near the end, and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep. I did not strap on the strait-jacket as was customary when he slept, since I saw that he was too feeble to be dangerous, even if he woke in mental disorder once more before passing away."}

Wild weeds, brambles, and grass grow very thick, unlike in settled areas. Planted fiellds are very few and poor. The scattered houses loook very old, dirty, and broken down. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask for directions from the twisted, lonely figures seen sometimes on broken steps. On sloping, rocky fields. Those figures are so quiet and secreitve one feels faced with forbidden things. It is better to avvoid them. When the road rises and shows mountains above the deep wood,s the strange unesae grows. The mountain tops are too round and even to feel comfortable or natural.

The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping, rock-strown meadows. Those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned."}

My friend was busy with the vending machine. This machine served as a drink dispenser in this plain building. From the plain white hall we had just left came the worst. Most sterile smell we had ever noticed. The core of medical cleanliness could not have been more unspeakable. It was as if a deep pit had opened to let out the sterility of the cleande. In one impossible scent was all the supreem cleanliness and unnatural blankness of lifeless surfaces. Organic it could not have been. Nature does not make such smells. Without thinking of our earlier task. How long it might take, both my friend. I jumped back from the closest seats like hurt animals. We knocked over magazines, coffee, and our things. We fled wildly into the bright light of the next hallway. I think we were gasping as we rushed desperately toward the exit. When we got to the courtyard we acted calm enough to look like confused visitors leaving an appointment.\n###\nThe olfactory phenomenon was quite sudden, and wholly unexpected. I was perusing some periodicals from one rack to another, and my companion was occupied with the vending machine which had to answer for a refreshment dispenser in this austere edifice, when from the stark-white corridor we had left there wafted the most appalling and antiseptic emanation that either of us had ever perceived. Not more unutterable could have been the essence of clinical purity if the abyss itself had opened to release the sterility of the cleansed, for in one inconceivable fragrance was centred all the supernal cleanliness and unnatural neutrality of inanimate surfaces. Organic it could not have been\u2014it is not in nature to produce such odors\u2014and without a thought of our prior occupation or its possible duration both my companion and I recoiled from the nearest seating like stricken animals; overturning magazines, coffee, and personal effects, and retreating madly into the fluorescent glare of the adjacent hallway.

Yet I kept searhcing with even more eagerness as events and discoveries grew more horrible. Two days after my terrifying crawl through that tomb of the eyes. Claw, I learned something had hung threateningly twenty miles away at the saem time the eyes were staring at me. I felt almost physical convulsions of fear. That fear was. Mixed with wonder. Strange attraction that it was almost a pleasant feeling. Sometimes, in the grip of a nightmare where unseen forces spin one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning pit of Nis, it is a relief. Even a joy to scream wildly. Throw oneself willingly along with the hideous whirlwind of dream-doom into whatever bottomless hole may open. And so it was with the waknig nightmare of Tempest Mountain. Finding that two monsters had haunted the place gave me in the end a mad desire to dive into very eatrh of the cursed area. I wanted to dig out the death that grinned from every inch of the poisonous soil with my bare hands. As soon as I could, I went to the grave of Jan Martense. Dug without success where I had dug before. A large cave-in had removed all signs of the underground passage. The rain had washed. Much drit back into the hole that I could not tell how deep I had dug that other da.y I also made a hard trip to the far-off small village where the death-creature had been burned. I got little reward for my effort. In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several bones. But none seemed to be the monster's. The settlers said the thing had only one victim. But I thought they were wrong. Besides a complete human skull, there was another bone piece that certainly had been part of a human skull at some time. Though people saw monster's quick drop, no one could say exactly what the creature looked like. Those who had seen it briefly called it simpyl a devil.\n###\nIt had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyes. There can be nothing normal in the mind of one who, knowing what I knew of the horrors of Tempest Mountain, would seek alone for the fear that lurked there. That at least two of the fear\u2019s embodiments were destroyed, formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this Acheron of multiform diabolism; yet I continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous. When, two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes and claw, I learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me, I experienced virtual convulsions of fright. But that fright was so mixed with wonder and alluring grotesqueness, that it was almost a pleasant sensation. Sometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of Nis, it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream-doom into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn. And so it was with the waking nightmare of Tempest Mountain; the discovery that two monsters had haunted the spot gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the very earth of the accursed region, and with bare hands dig out the death that leered from every inch of the poisonous soil. As soon as possible I visited the grave of Jan Martense and dug vainly where I had dug before. Some extensive cave-in had obliterated all trace of the underground passage, while the rain had washed so much earth back into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had dug that other day. I likewise made a difficult trip to the distant hamlet where the death-creature had been burnt, and was little repaid for my trouble. In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several bones, but apparently none of the monster\u2019s. The squatters said the thing had had only one victim; but in this I judged them inaccurate, since besides the complete skull of a human being, there was another bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull at some time. Though the rapid drop of the monster had been seen, no one could say just what the creature was like; those who had glimpsed it called it simply a devil."}

While Asenath\u2019s face aged, Edward\u2019s\u2014aside from those exceptional occasions\u2014actually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity, save when a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash across it. It was really very puzzling. Meanwhile the Derbys almost dropped out of the gay college circle\u2014not through their own disgust, we heard, but because something about their present studies shocked even the most callous of the other decadents. It was in the third year of the marriage that Edward began to hint openly to me of a certain fear and dissatisfaction. He would let fall remarks about things \u2018going too far\u2019, and would talk darkly about the need of \u2018saving his identity\u2019. At first I ignored such references, but in time I began to question him guardedly, remembering what my friend\u2019s daughter had said about Asenath\u2019s hypnotic influence over the other girls at school\u2014the cases where students had thought they were in her body looking across the room at themselves. This questioning seemed to make him at once alarmed and grateful, and once he mumbled something about having a serious talk with me later. About this time old Mr. Derby died, for which I was afterward very thankful. Edward was badly upset, though by no means disorganised. He had seen astonishingly little of his parent since his marriage, for Asenath had concentrated in herself all his vital sense of family linkage. Some called him callous in his loss\u2014especially since those jaunty and confident moods in the car began to increase. He now wished to move back into the old Derby mansion, but Asenath insisted on staying in the Crowninshield house, to which she had become well adjusted."}

It was not a pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out with more than natural clearness and reality. I had been lying with my face away from my uncle\u2019s chair, so that in this sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, the more northerly window, and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room, all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light brighter than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside. It was not a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strong enough to read an average book by. But it cast a shadow of myself and the cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, penetrating force that hinted at things more potent than luminosity. This I perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently assailed. For on my ears rang the reverberations of that shocking scream, while my nostrils revolted at the stench which filled the place. My mind, as alert as my senses, recognised the gravely unusual; and almost automatically I leaped up and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left trained on the mouldy spot before the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded what I was to see; for the scream had been in my uncle\u2019s voice, and I knew not against what menace I should have to defend him and myself. Yet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are horrors beyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few. Out of the fungus-ridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light, yellow and diseased, which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height in vague outlines half-human and half-monstrous, through which I could see the chimney and fireplace beyond.

Naphthali Field 's grave seemed as hard to find as Curwen 's grave. However, there was no organized effort to erase this grave. So, one could reasonably hope to find the [THING] itself. This could happen even if the written record was lost. Therefore, they took many walks. They excluded St. John 's Churchyard and the old Congregtaional burying - ground in the middle of Swan Point Cemetery. Other records showed that the only Naphthali Field whose grave could be the target was a Baptist. It was near May when Dr. Willett spoke with the young [THING]. He did this at the request of the senior Ward. He was also armed with all the Curwen information the family had collected. They got this from Charles during his more open period. The conversation was not very useful or decisive. Willett felt constantly that Charles was completely in control. He was also focused on matters of real importance. It at least made the secretive young [THING] give some logical reason for his recent behavior. Ward had a pale, calm [THING] that did not easily show embarrassment. He seemed quite willing to talk about his activities. However, he would not reveal their goa.l He said his ancestor 's papers contained soem remarkable secrets. These were secrets of early scientific knowledge. Most were in code. Their apparent range was only comparable to the discoveries of Friar Bacon. They might even surpass those discoveries. However, they were meaningless unless connected to a [THING] of knowledge. That knowledge is now completely out of date. Presenting them immediately to a world with only modern science would strip them of all impact. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought, they must first be connected by someone. That [THING] must know the background from which they came. Ward was now dedicating himself to this task of connection. He was trying to learn as fast as possible those neglected old skills. A true interpreter of the Curwen data must have these skills. He hoped in time to make a full announcement. He believed it would be of the greatest interest to humanity. The world of thought. He declared that not even Einstein could more deeply change the current understanding of things. Regarding his graveyard search, he freely admitted its purpose. But he did not share the details of its progress. He said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwen 's damaged headstone had certain mystic symbols. These were carved based on directions in his will. The [THING] who erased the name ignorantly left them untouched. These symbols were absoluetly necessary for the final solution of his cryptic system.\n###\nThe lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Field\u2019s grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles\u2014from which St. John\u2019s (the former King\u2019s) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist. It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things. As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwen\u2019s mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols\u2014carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name\u2014which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system."}

True, we had become used to seeing the incredible secret hidden by the barrier peaks..

Ten or fifteen rods farther on was a huge roofless wall. It was still complete in its giant five-pointed shape. Rose to an uneven height of ten. We aimed for this wall.

It went down to basement halls. we saw marks in the trash under our feet. After we left the gasoline smell, we noticed that smell. It came in waves. After our path split from the one, we shone our light on the walls. We saw carvings. These carvings were a art form for the Old Ones. Around 9:30 PM, we walked down a hall with a roof. The floor was and seemed below ground. The roof got as we went. We saw daylight. We turned off our light. We seemed to be nearing a place. We could not be from the surface. The hall ended in a arch for ruins. We could see a lot through it before we went out. Beyond was a space. It was 200 feet. It was of rubble. It had blocked arches like the one we would cross. The walls had carvings where. The art was despite weather damage from being. The floor was. We thought the floor was. But the feature was a stone ramp. It avoided the arches by turning onto the floor. It spiraled up the wall. It was like the version of ramps on Babylon towers. Our flight and the view from the air hid this. The descent seemed part of the wall. That is why we missed it from the air. That made us find another way to the ice level.\n###\nThe other neighbouring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that. I need not speak of our journey\u2014during which we continued to leave an economical trail of paper\u2014for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had reached the cul de sac; except that it tended to adhere more closely to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors. Every now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter under foot; and after we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent we were again faintly conscious\u2014spasmodically\u2014of that more hideous and more persistent scent. After the way had branched from our former course we sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls; noting in almost every case the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which indeed seem to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the Old Ones. About 9:30 P.M., while traversing a vaulted corridor whose increasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew lower as we advanced, we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to turn off our torch. It appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place, and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great. The corridor ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged. Beyond there stretched a prodigious round space\u2014fully 200 feet in diameter\u2014strown with debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to cross. The walls were\u2014in available spaces\u2014boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic proportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused by the openness of the spot, an artistic splendour far beyond anything we had encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily glaciated, and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depth. But the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which, eluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique Babylon. Only the rapidity of our flight, and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower\u2019s inner wall, had prevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the sub-glacial level."}

Suddenly, the car went around a wide corner at the top of a steep hill. Then it stopped. On my left, there was a neat lawn. It reached to the road and had a border of white-painted stones. A large, ellegant white house rose there. It had two and a half stories. For this area, it was unusually big and fine. Behind it and to the right were many connected barns, sheds, and a windmill. I knew it at once from the photo I had been sent. I was not surprised to seee Henry Akeley's name on the metal mail-box near the road. Behind the house, a flat area of marshy land stretched back. It had few trees. Beyond that, a steep, wooded hillside rose high. It ended in a rough, leafy top. I knew this was the top of Dark Mountain.

I recognised it at once from the snapshot I had received, and was not surprised to see the name of Henry Akeley on the galvanised-iron mail-box near the road.

This latter, I knew, was the summit of Dark Mountain, half way up which we must have climbed already."}

The men danced at the back. The line jumped and leaped with Dionysiac anger. Malone walked after them a steps. He was and. He doubted his place in this world or any world. he turned. He stumbled.

Malone lifted himself on his elbow to look. The light of the room,, had grown a. In that light appeared the shape of what should not run. It was the - eyed, rotting body of the man. It needed no support. It was moved by some magic from the - finished ceremony. After it ran the, giggling, glowing thing that belonged on the carved stand. breathed the men. And all the group of, things. The body was getting of its followers. It seemed on a goal. It strained with every rotting muscle toward the carved gold stand. That stand 's importance was. Another moment and it reached its goal. The crowd struggled on with speed. But they were. With one burst of strength that tore muscle from muscle, it sent its body struggling to the floor in a state of jelly - falling. The staring body that had been Robert Suydam reached its goal and its victory. The push had been. But the froce had lasted. As the pusher fell into a spot of decay, the stand he had pushed shook, leaned. fell from its onyx base into the waters. It sent up a flash of carved gold as it sank to places of Tartarus.\n###\nThe strange dark men danced in the rear, and the whole column skipped and leaped with Dionysiac fury. Malone staggered after them a few steps, delirious and hazy, and doubtful of his place in this or in any world. Then he turned, faltered, and sank down on the cold damp stone, gasping and shivering as the daemon organ croaked on, and the howling and drumming and tinkling of the mad procession grew fainter and fainter. Vaguely he was conscious of chanted horrors and shocking croakings afar off. Now and then a wail or whine of ceremonial devotion would float to him through the black arcade, whilst eventually there rose the dreadful Greek incantation whose text he had read above the pulpit of that dance-hall church. As the chant closed, a general shout went up, and hissing sounds nearly drowned the croaking of the cracked bass organ. Then a gasp as from many throats, and a babel of barked and bleated words\u2014\u201cLilith, Great Lilith, behold the Bridegroom!\u201d More cries, a clamour of rioting, and the sharp, clicking footfalls of a running figure. The footfalls approached, and Malone raised himself to his elbow to look. The luminosity of the crypt, lately diminished, had now slightly increased; and in that devil-light there appeared the fleeing form of that which should not flee or feel or breathe\u2014the glassy-eyed, gangrenous corpse of the corpulent old man, now needing no support, but animated by some infernal sorcery of the rite just closed. After it raced the naked, tittering, phosphorescent thing that belonged on the carven pedestal, and still farther behind panted the dark men, and all the dread crew of sentient loathsomenesses. The corpse was gaining on its pursuers, and seemed bent on a definite object, straining with every rotting muscle toward the carved golden pedestal, whose necromantic importance was evidently so great. Another moment and it had reached its goal, whilst the trailing throng laboured on with more frantic speed. But they were too late, for in one final spurt of strength which ripped tendon from tendon and sent its noisome bulk floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish dissolution, the staring corpse which had been Robert Suydam achieved its object and its triumph. The push had been tremendous, but the force had held out; and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy blotch of corruption the pedestal he had pushed tottered, tipped, and finally careened from its onyx base into the thick waters below, sending up a parting gleam of carven gold as it sank heavily to undreamable gulfs of lower Tartarus."}

He waited patiently, listening for their fluttering sound. At last, he felt many eeys watching him. These were the zoogs. One sees theri strange eyes long before seeing their small, slipprey brown bodies. They came out from hidden holes and trees full of holes. Soon the whole dim area was full of them. Some wild ones brushed against Carter in an unpleasant way. One even bit his ear in a disgusting manner. But the older zoogs quickly controlled these unruly ones. The Council of Sages recognized the visitor. He offered a gourd of fermented sap from a special haunted [THING]. This [THING] grew from a seed dropped by someone on the [THING]. Carter drank it formally. Then a very strange conversation began. Sadly, the zoogs did not know where the peak of Kadath is. They also could not say if the cold waste is in our dream world. Rumours of the Great Ones cmoe equally from all directions. One can only say they are more likely seen on high [THING] peaks than in valleys. On such peaks, they dance with memory when the [THING] is above. Clouds are below. Then one vrey old zoog remembered something the others had never heard. He siad that in Ulthar, beyond the [THING] Skai, the last copy of those very old Pnakotic Manuscripts still remains. Waking men in forgotten northern kingdoms made these. They were brought to the dream land when the hairy cannibal Gnophkehs conquered many - templed Olatho\u00eb. He killed all the heroes of the land of Lomar. Those manuscripts, he said, tell much about the gods. Also, in Ulthar there were men who had seen signs of the gods. Theer was even one old priest who climbed a great [THING] to see them dancing by moonlight. He failed, though his companion succeeded and died without a name. So Randolph Carter thanked the zoogs. They fluttered in a friendly wa.y They gave him another gourd of [THING] - [THING] [THING] to take with him. He set out through the glowing [THING] for the other side. There, the rushing Skai flows down from the slopes of Lerion. Also, Hatheg and Nir and Ulthar dot the plain. Several curious zoogs crept after him, hidden and unseen. They wanted to learn what might happen to him. They wanted to bring the story back to their [THNIG].\n###\nThis was the nearest of the great ring of stones, and Carter knew he was close to the zoog village. Renewing his fluttering sound, he waited patiently; and was at length rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching him. It was the zoogs, for one sees their weird eyes long before one can discern their small, slippery brown outlines. Out they swarmed, from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree, till the whole dim-litten region was alive with them. Some of the wilder ones brushed Carter unpleasantly, and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear; but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders. The Council of Sages, recognising the visitor, offered a gourd of fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others, which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon; and as Carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began. The zoogs did not, unfortunately, know where the peak of Kadath lies, nor could they even say whether the cold waste is in our dream-world or in another. Rumours of the Great Ones came equally from all points; and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys, since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneath. Then one very ancient zoog recalled a thing unheard-of by the others; and said that in Ulthar, beyond the river Skai, there still lingered the last copy of those inconceivably old Pnakotic Manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy cannibal Gnophkehs overcame many-templed Olatho\u00eb and slew all the heroes of the land of Lomar. Those manuscripts, he said, told much of the gods; and besides, in Ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods, and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight. He had failed, though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly. So Randolph Carter thanked the zoogs, who fluttered amicably and gave him another gourd of moon-tree wine to take with him, and set out through the phosphorescent wood for the other side, where the rushing Skai flows down from the slopes of Lerion, and Hatheg and Nir and Ulthar dot the plain. Behind him, furtive and unseen, crept several of the curious zoogs; for they wished to learn what might befall him, and bear back the legend to their people."}

I will quote the following account of the star Nova Persei verbatim from the pages of that eminent astronomical authority, Prof. Garrett P. Serviss: On February 22, 1901, a marvellous new star was discovered by Dr. Anderson, of Edinburgh, not very far from Algol. No star had been visible at that point before. Within twenty-four hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone Capella. In a week or two it had visibly faded, and in the course of a few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye.\u201d In the valley of Nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly, tearing a path for its light with feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a great upas-tree. And within the depths of the valley, where the light reaches not, move forms not meet to be beheld. Rank is the herbage on each slope, where evil vines and creeping plants crawl amidst the stones of ruined palaces, twining tightly about broken columns and strange monoliths, and heaving up marble pavements laid by forgotten hands. And in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards leap little apes, while in and out of deep treasure-vaults writhe poison serpents and scaly things without a name. Vast are the stones which sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss, and mighty were the walls from which they fell. For all time did their builders erect them, and in sooth they yet serve nobly, for beneath them the grey toad makes his habitation. At the very bottom of the valley lies the river Than, whose waters are slimy and filled with weeds."}

Indeed, he would rather have it thus; for then the sight of old brick slums and dark foreign faces would not eat so deeply into his soul. But at the time it was all horribly real, and nothing can ever efface the memory of those nighted crypts, those titan arcades, and those half-formed shapes of hell that strode gigantically in silence holding half-eaten things whose still surviving portions screamed for mercy or laughed with madness. Odours of incense and corruption joined in sickening concert, and the black air was alive with the cloudy, semi-visible bulk of shapeless elemental things with eyes. Somewhere dark sticky water was lapping at onyx piers, and once the shivery tinkle of raucous little bells pealed out to greet the insane titter of a naked phosphorescent thing which swam into sight, scrambled ashore, and climbed up to squat leeringly on a carved golden pedestal in the background. Avenues of limitless night seemed to radiate in every direction, till one might fancy that here lay the root of a contagion destined to sicken and swallow cities, and engulf nations in the foetor of hybrid pestilence. Here cosmic sin had entered, and festered by unhallowed rites had commenced the grinning march of death that was to rot us all to fungous abnormalities too hideous for the grave\u2019s holding. Satan here held his Babylonish court, and in the blood of stainless childhood the leprous limbs of phosphorescent Lilith were laved.

It seems that on that last heavy afternoon, I had bent down to smell the grave-like dust particles. They floated from the old trunk to nearby window. In the dim light, they were very unclear. But a beam of pale light came between the trunk's bulk and the wall paneling. There I had seen something odd. Or I thought I had, because no one else could agree with me. This was despite the undeniable oldness of the smell. The particles in the light were certainly very different from common house dust. Even the caretaker. The antiquarian would not admit they were like the spores of some tniy, fungus-like growth.\n###\nIt seems that on that last oppressive afternoon I had stooped to inhale the sepulchral dust-motes which drifted from the ancient trunk to the nearby casement. In the dimness they were very indistinct, but a shaft of pallid light intervened between the trunk\u2019s bulk and the wainscoting. There I had perceived something anomalous\u2014or thought I had, for no one else could quite concur with me despite the undeniable antiquity of the effluvium. The motes in the luminescence were certainly vastly unlike the common particles of a dwelling, but even the caretaker and the antiquarian would not admit that they were like the spores of some minute and fungous growth."}

The old town records say the first owner built the fence when the property was new. He used only clean pine wood and varnish. Later, people who lived there felt a restless curiosity. They looked at the old fence in the late afternoon light. They saw a strange, patterned decay in the bare wood. It looked like the paint was split by a slow, natural force. The pattern was like one seen in messy, stained parts of old ledger margins that cnanot be read. They saw this.\n###\nNow it is told in the forgotten ledgers of the town that the first owner found naught but unblemished pine and varnish when he erected the fence in the youth of the property. Yet when the later inhabitants of that lot, driven by a vague and restless curiosity, examined that weathered barrier by the light of a waning afternoon, they found revealed in the naked wood of the paling a curious and tessellated pattern of decay, as if the paint had been sundered by some elemental and patient force. And the pattern was like to one that observant men have discerned in those chaotic parts of the ledger margins which are too stained to be read. This they beheld."}

The discvoery was because it indicated as the farm house built in 1761 on the site of the, a building standing in Olney Court. Well known to Ward in his walks over Stampers ' Hill. The place was a blocks from his home on the hill 's ground. Was the home of a family respected for washing, housecleaning. To find, in Salem, proof of the significance of this house in his family history, was a thing to Ward. And he resolved to explore the place upon his return. The parts of the letter, which he took to be some kind of symbolism, confused him.

All the days of my appionted time will I wait, till my change come. \u201d Young Ward came in a state of excitement. Spent the following day in a. study of the house in Olney Court.

Distance from Boston Stone abt. XLIV Miles. This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwen\u2019s Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers\u2019 Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hill\u2019s higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to\u2014Job 14, 14\u2014was the familiar verse, \u201cIf a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\u201d Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest."}

The thing lay partly bent on its side. It was in a dirty pool of messy lnien and sticky material. It was almost nine feet The cat had scratched off all the bed cover and some of the sheet. It was not very neat. It hung down quietly and with jersk. Its surface moved in a huge, single motion. This matched the crazy rustling of the waiting curtains outisde. Bits of pillow filling and pieces of beddnig were spread around the room. Just inside the closet, an laundry basket lay where it had clearly been thrown. Near the main nightstand, a feather duster had fallen. A bent but unused hnadle later explained why it had not been used. The thing itself, however, pushed out all other pictures at that time. It would be common. Not fully correct to say no human hand could arrange it. But one can rightly say it could not be clearly imagined by anyone. This is for those whose ideas of balance. Order are too tied to the normal home shapes of this house. Of the three known dimensions. It was partly made, without doubt, with vrey square-like corners and a headboard. The heavy, pillow-less top showed signs of being done in a hurry. But the middle and lower parts of the structure were strangely and wonderfully made. Only generous tucking could have let it rest in daylight without being qusetioned or removed.\n###\nThe thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of rumpled linen and tangled stickiness was almost nine feet wide, and the cat had clawed off all the coverlet and some of the sheeting. It was not quite orderly, but sagged silently and spasmodically while its surface heaved in monstrous unison with the mad rustling of the expectant curtains outside. Bits of pillow-stuffing and fragments of bedding were scattered about the chamber, and just inside the wardrobe an empty laundry hamper lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central nightstand a feather-duster had fallen, a bent but undischarged handle later explaining why it had not been wielded. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human hand could arrange it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of symmetry and order are too closely bound up with the common domestic forms of this household and of the three known dimensions. It was partly made, beyond a doubt, with very square-like corners and headboard, and the lumpish, pillowless crest had the stamp of haste upon it. But the center and lower parts of the construction were teratologically fabulous, so that only generous tucking could ever have enabled it to rest in daylight unchallenged or uneradicated."}

The sense of acquaintance was and. I was looking, at a row near the top. out of my reach. I wondered how I could climb. An door four rows from the bottom would help.

The next I knew I had ceased my tiptoe racing and was standing still, staring at a row of maddeningly familiar hieroglyphed shelves. They were in a state of almost perfect preservation, and only three of the doors in this vicinity had sprung open. My feelings toward these shelves cannot be described\u2014so utter and insistent was the sense of old acquaintance. I was looking high up, at a row near the top and wholly out of my reach, and wondering how I could climb to best advantage. An open door four rows from the bottom would help, and the locks of the closed doors formed possible holds for hands and feet. I would grip the torch between my teeth as I had in other places where both hands were needed. Above all, I must make no noise. How to get down what I wished to remove would be difficult, but I could probably hook its movable fastener in my coat collar and carry it like a knapsack. Again I wondered whether the lock would be undamaged. That I could repeat each familiar motion I had not the least doubt. But I hoped the thing would not scrape or creak\u2014and that my hand could work it properly. Even as I thought these things I had taken the torch in my mouth and begun to climb. The projecting locks were poor supports; but as I had expected, the opened shelf helped greatly. I used both the difficultly swinging door and the edge of the aperture itself in my ascent, and managed to avoid any loud creaking. Balanced on the upper edge of the door, and leaning far to my right, I could just reach the lock I sought. My fingers, half-numb from climbing, were very clumsy at first; but I soon saw that they were anatomically adequate. And the memory-rhythm was strong in them. Out of unknown gulfs of time the intricate secret motions had somehow reached my brain correctly in every detail\u2014for after less than five minutes of trying there came a click whose familiarity was all the more startling because I had not consciously anticipated it. In another instant the metal door was slowly swinging open with only the faintest grating sound. Dazedly I looked over the row of greyish case-ends thus exposed, and felt a tremendous surge of some wholly inexplicable emotion."}

The small many-sided shape that always followed him. They, like him, had turned into strands of milky, faintly glowing fog in this further emptiness of final darkness. Something had gone aheadand he believed their movement was not in a straight line. Instead, they moved along the strange curves and spirals of some airy whirlpool. This whirlpool followed rules unknown to the physics and math of any imaginable universe. Eventually there had been a suggestion of huge, jumping shadows. There was a monstrous, half-sound pulsing, and the thin, steady whistling of an unseen flute. But that was all. Gilman decided he had gotten that last idea from what he read in the Necronomicon about the mindless being Azathoth. This being rules all time. Space from a stragnely placed black throne at the center of Chaos. After the blood was cleaned off, the wrist injury was very small. Gilman wondered about the spot of the two tiny holes. He thought that there was no blood on the bedcover where he had been lying. This was very odd because there was much blood on his skin and sleeve. Had he been walking in his sleep in his room? Had the rat bitten him. He sat in a chair. Stood in some stranger position? He looked in all corners for brown drops or marks but found none. He thought he should spread flour inside the room as well as outside the door. But after all, no more proof of his sleepwalking was needed. He knew he did walk. Now he must stop it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help. This morning the strange pulls from space seemed weaker. But they were replaced by another feeling even harder to explain. It was a unclear, strong wish to flee from his current situation. But it gave no hint of the exact direction he wanted to go. When he lifted the strange sharp-pointed object on the table, he thought the older pull toward the north grew a little stronger. But still, it was completely overcome by the newer and more confusing desire. He carried the sharp-pointed object down to Elwood\u2019s room. He prepared himself against the crying sounds of the loom repairman that rose from the first floor.\n###\nHe had been taken there by the bubble-congeries and the little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they, like himself, had changed to wisps of milky, barely luminous mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness. Something else had gone on ahead\u2014a larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of form\u2014and he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line, but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos. Eventually there had been a hint of vast, leaping shadows, of a monstrous, half-acoustic pulsing, and of the thin, monotonous piping of an unseen flute\u2014but that was all. Gilman decided he had picked up that last conception from what he had read in the Necronomicon about the mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the centre of Chaos. When the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight, and Gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures. It occurred to him that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had lain\u2014which was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and cuff. Had he been sleep-walking within his room, and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position? He looked in every corner for brownish drops or stains, but did not find any. He had better, he thought, sprinkle flour within the room as well as outside the door\u2014though after all no further proof of his sleep-walking was needed. He knew he did walk\u2014and the thing to do now was to stop it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help. This morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable. It was a vague, insistent impulse to fly away from his present situation, but held not a hint of the specific direction in which he wished to fly. As he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a trifle stronger; but even so, it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urge. He took the spiky image down to Elwood\u2019s room, steeling himself against the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor."}

Walls on the mountainsides were anything. How could they be? At the time this region fell under the rule of death, humans themselves could have been told from the apes. Yet the rule of reason seemed shaken. This maze of squared, curved. Angled blocks had features that cut off all escape. It was,, the city of the mirage in, objective. That sign had a basis. There had been some layer of ice dust in the air. This stone survival had projected its image across the mountains according to the laws of reflection., the phantom had been twisted and. It had conatined things the source did not contain., as we saw that source, we thought it. Threatening than its image. the, massiveness of these stone towers. Walls had saved the thing from destruction. It had been for hundreds of thousands, millions, of years amidst the winds of a highland. \" Corona Mundi... Roof of the World... \" All sorts of phrases came to our lips as we looked at the sight. I thought of the myths thta had. haunted me since my sight of this world. I thought of the plateau of Leng, of the Mi - Go. Snow - Men of the Himalayas, of the Pnakotic Manuscripts with their meanings, of the Cthulhu cult, of the Necronomicon. Of the legends of Tsathoggua. The than star - spawn linked with that - entity. For miles in every direction the thing stretched with thinning., as our eyes followed it to the right. Left along the base of th,e foothills that separated it from the mountain edge, we decided we could see no thinning. The break was at the left of the pass we had come through. We had hit, by chance, a part of something of size.\n###\nWe had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned, any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other than natural in origin. How could they be otherwise, when man himself could scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial death? Yet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken, for this Cyclopean maze of squared, curved, and angled blocks had features which cut off all comfortable refuge. It was, very clearly, the blasphemous city of the mirage in stark, objective, and ineluctable reality. That damnable portent had had a material basis after all\u2014there had been some horizontal stratum of ice-dust in the upper air, and this shocking stone survival had projected its image across the mountains according to the simple laws of reflection. Of course the phantom had been twisted and exaggerated, and had contained things which the real source did not contain; yet now, as we saw that real source, we thought it even more hideous and menacing than its distant image. Only the incredible, unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers and ramparts had saved the frightful thing from utter annihilation in the hundreds of thousands\u2014perhaps millions\u2014of years it had brooded there amidst the blasts of a bleak upland. \u201cCorona Mundi . . . Roof of the World . . .\u201d All sorts of fantastic phrases sprang to our lips as we looked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle. I thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently haunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic world\u2014of the daemoniac plateau of Leng, of the Mi-Go, or Abominable Snow-Men of the Himalayas, of the Pnakotic Manuscripts with their pre-human implications, of the Cthulhu cult, of the Necronomicon, and of the Hyperborean legends of formless Tsathoggua and the worse than formless star-spawn associated with that semi-entity. For boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little thinning; indeed, as our eyes followed it to the right and left along the base of the low, gradual foothills which separated it from the actual mountain rim, we decided that we could see no thinning at all except for an interruption at the left of the pass through which we had come. We had merely struck, at random, a limited part of something of incalculable extent."}

The next morning, I told the others about my discovery. Dyer, Freeborn, Boyle, my son, and I went to see the strange [THING]. Failure met us. I did not have a clear memory of the [THING] 's place. A late [THING] had completely changed the shapes of the sand hills. I now reach the key and hardest part of my story. It is hardest because I can not be fully sure it was real. Sometimes I feel very sure I was not dreaming or mistaken. This feeling makes me write this account. The truth of my experience has huge meanings. My son will be the main judge of my tale. He is a trained psychologist. He knows my whole situation fully and sympathetically. First, I will describe the outside facts. The [THING] at the camp know these. On the night of July 17 - 18, the day was windy. I went to bed early but could not sleep. Rising just before eleven, I felt the usual strange feeling about the land to the northeast. I started one of my usual night walks. I saw and greeted only one [THING] as I left our area. He was Australian miner named Tupper. The [THING] was a little past full. It shone from a clear [THING]. It covered the old sands with a white, sickly light. This light seemed to me very evil. There was no [THING] anymore. No [THING] came back for almost five hours. Tupper and others who stayed awake all night confirmed this. The Australian last saw me walking quickly across the pale, secret - keeping sand hills toward the northeast. Around 3:30 a.m., a strong [THING] rose. It woke everyone in camp and knocked down three tents. The [THING] had no clouds. The desert still glowed with that sickly moonlight. The group checked the tents. They noticed I was missing. Given my past walks, this did not worry anyone. Yet as many as three men felt something bad in the air. They were all Australians. Mackenzie explained to Prof. Freeborn that this fear came from native stories. The natives had made a strange set of bad myths. These myths were about the strong winds. These winds blow across the sands under a clear [THING] at long times.\n###\nI remained awake all that night, but by dawn realised how silly I had been to let the shadow of a myth upset me. Instead of being frightened, I should have had a discoverer\u2019s enthusiasm. The next forenoon I told the others about my find, and Dyer, Freeborn, Boyle, my son, and I set out to view the anomalous block. Failure, however, confronted us. I had formed no clear idea of the stone\u2019s location, and a late wind had wholly altered the hillocks of shifting sand. I come now to the crucial and most difficult part of my narrative\u2014all the more difficult because I cannot be quite certain of its reality. At times I feel uncomfortably sure that I was not dreaming or deluded; and it is this feeling\u2014in view of the stupendous implications which the objective truth of my experience would raise\u2014which impels me to make this record. My son\u2014a trained psychologist with the fullest and most sympathetic knowledge of my whole case\u2014shall be the primary judge of what I have to tell. First let me outline the externals of the matter, as those at the camp know them. On the night of July 17\u201318, after a windy day, I retired early but could not sleep. Rising shortly before eleven, and afflicted as usual with that strange feeling regarding the northeastward terrain, I set out on one of my typical nocturnal walks; seeing and greeting only one person\u2014an Australian miner named Tupper\u2014as I left our precincts. The moon, slightly past full, shone from a clear sky and drenched the ancient sands with a white, leprous radiance which seemed to me somehow infinitely evil. There was no longer any wind, nor did any return for nearly five hours, as amply attested by Tupper and others who did not sleep through the night. The Australian last saw me walking rapidly across the pallid, secret-guarding hillocks toward the northeast. About 3:30 a.m. a violent wind blew up, waking everyone in camp and felling three of the tents. The sky was unclouded, and the desert still blazed with that leprous moonlight. As the party saw to the tents my absence was noted, but in view of my previous walks this circumstance gave no one alarm. And yet as many as three men\u2014all Australians\u2014seemed to feel something sinister in the air. Mackenzie explained to Prof. Freeborn that this was a fear picked up from blackfellow folklore\u2014the natives having woven a curious fabric of malignant myth about the high winds which at long intervals sweep across the sands under a clear sky."}

All afternoon we all examined the account book nervously. We tried to make the numbers match at various times, but always without success.

About noon I encountered a suitable supply house far downtown, and at approximately 1:30 p.m. arrived at my boarding-place with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent mechanics. I had done all I could, and hoped I was in time. Black terror, however, had preceded me. The house was in utter turmoil, and above the chatter of awed voices I heard a man praying in a deep basso. Fiendish things were in the air, and lodgers told over the beads of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the doctor\u2019s closed door. The lounger I had hired, it seems, had fled screaming and mad-eyed not long after his second delivery of ice; perhaps as a result of excessive curiosity. He could not, of course, have locked the door behind him; yet it was now fastened, presumably from the inside. There was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow, thick dripping. Briefly consulting with Mrs. Herrero and the workmen despite a fear that gnawed my inmost soul, I advised the breaking down of the door; but the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some wire device. We had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms on that hall, and flung all the windows to the very top. Now, noses protected by handkerchiefs, we tremblingly invaded the accursed south room which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoon. A kind of dark, slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall door, and thence to the desk, where a terrible little pool had accumulated. Something was scrawled there in pencil in an awful, blind hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws that traced the hurried last words. Then the trail led to the couch and ended unutterably. What was, or had been, on the couch I cannot and dare not say here. But this is what I shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before I drew a match and burned it to a crisp; what I puzzled out in terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police station."}

The flutes made terrible sounds. I heard the drums beating again from the island ruins. Then the [THING] spirits moved silently and smoothly to the [THING]. They disappeared one by one into the old swamp. The line of followers did not slow down. They splashed clumsily after them. They vanished in a small whirlpool of bad bubbles. I could barely see this in the red light. The last sad [THING] left behind was the fat cook. He sank heavily out of sight in that gloomy pool. The flutes and drums became silent. The blinding red rays from the ruins went out instantly. The doomed [THING] was left alone. Empty in the pale light of the newly risen moon. My state of mind was now one of complete disorder. I did not know if I was crazy or sane. I did not know if I was sleeping or awake. I was saved only by a kind numbness. I believe I did foolish things. I prayed to Artemis, Latona, Demeter, Persephone, and Plouton. All my early learning came to my lips. The horror of the situation woke my deepest superstitions. I felt I had seen a whole [THING] die. I knew I was alnoe in the castle with Denys Barry. His bold acitons had caused a disaster. When I thought of him, new fears shook me. I fell to the [THING]. I did not faint, but I could not move. Then I felt the cold [THING] from the east [THING] where the [THING] had risen. I began to hear screams in the castle far below me. Soon those screams had reached a level and a kind that can not be described. They make me feel weak when I think of them. All I can say is they came from something I had known as a friend. At some point during this shocking time, the cold [THING]. The screaming must have woken me. My next memory is of running wildly through dark rooms and hallways. I ran out across the courtyard itno the terrilbe night. They found me at dawn wandering without thought near Ballylough. What truly broke my mind was not any horror I had seen. What I talked about as I slowly came out of the darkness was two strange events during my escape. These events meant nothing, yet they trouble me constantly. This happens when I am alone in some swampy places or in the moonlight.\n###\nThe flutes piped horribly, and again I heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the island ruin. Then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one into the ancient bog; while the line of followers, never checking their speed, splashed awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which I could barely see in the scarlet light. And as the last pathetic straggler, the fat cook, sank heavily out of sight in that sullen pool, the flutes and the drums grew silent, and the blinding red rays from the ruins snapped instantaneously out, leaving the village of doom lone and desolate in the wan beams of a new-risen moon. My condition was now one of indescribable chaos. Not knowing whether I was mad or sane, sleeping or waking, I was saved only by a merciful numbness. I believe I did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to Artemis, Latona, Demeter, Persephone, and Plouton. All that I recalled of a classic youth came to my lips as the horrors of the situation roused my deepest superstitions. I felt that I had witnessed the death of a whole village, and knew I was alone in the castle with Denys Barry, whose boldness had brought down a doom. As I thought of him new terrors convulsed me, and I fell to the floor; not fainting, but physically helpless. Then I felt the icy blast from the east window where the moon had risen, and began to hear the shrieks in the castle far below me. Soon those shrieks had attained a magnitude and quality which cannot be written of, and which make me faint as I think of them. All I can say is that they came from something I had known as a friend. At some time during this shocking period the cold wind and the screaming must have roused me, for my next impression is of racing madly through inky rooms and corridors and out across the courtyard into the hideous night. They found me at dawn wandering mindless near Ballylough, but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors I had seen or heard before. What I muttered about as I came slowly out of the shadows was a pair of fantastic incidents which occurred in my flight; incidents of no significance, yet which haunt me unceasingly when I am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlight."}

It had been used for cheap rooms for a long time. Gilman did not know what he hoped to find there. But he wanted to be in that building. In that biulding, some evnet had once happened. That event gave an ordinary old woman from the 1600s a deep understanding of mathematics. This understanding might be beyond the deepest modern research of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein. He looked at the timebr and plaster walls. He looked for signs of hidden designs wherever the wallpaper had peeled. Within a week, he got the eastern attic room. Keziah was said to have done her magic there. That room had been empty from the start. No one had ever wanted to stay there long. But the Polish landlord had become careful about renting it. Yet nothing at all happened to Gilman until about the time of the fever. No ghostly Keziah moved through the dark halls and rooms. No small furry creature crept into his gloomy room to nuzlze him. His constant search found no record of the witch's spells. Sometimes he would take walks. He walked through shadowy, tangled lanes. lanes were unpaved and smelled musty. Strange brown houses of unknown age leaned and wobbled there. They seemed to leer mockingly through narrow windows with small panes. He knew strange things had happened here once. There was a faint feeling behind the surface. That feeling was that not everything from that monstrous past had completely vanished. This was especially true in the darkest, narrowest, and most twisted alleys. He also rowed out to island in the river twice. The island had a bad reputation. He made a sketch of the strange angles formed by the rows of grey standing stones. The stones were covered in moss. Their origin was very obscure and ancient. Gilman's room was a good size. But its shape was oddly irregular. The north wall slanted inward noticeably from the outer end to the inner end. The low ceiling also slanted gently downward in the same direction. Aside from an obvious rat-hole. Signs of other blocked hloes, there was no way in. There was also no sign of any old way in. Thsi was for the space that msut exist between slanting wall. The straight outer wall on the north side of the house. Looking from outside showed where a window had been boarded up very long time ago. The loft above the ceiling was also impossible to reach. That loft must have had a slanted floor.\n###\nA room was easy to secure; for the house was unpopular, hard to rent, and long given over to cheap lodgings. Gilman could not have told what he expected to find there, but he knew he wanted to be in the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old woman of the seventeenth century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps beyond the utmost modern delvings of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, and de Sitter. He studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every accessible spot where the paper had peeled, and within a week managed to get the eastern attic room where Keziah was held to have practiced her spells. It had been vacant from the first\u2014for no one had ever been willing to stay there long\u2014but the Polish landlord had grown wary about renting it. Yet nothing whatever happened to Gilman till about the time of the fever. No ghostly Keziah flitted through the sombre halls and chambers, no small furry thing crept into his dismal eyrie to nuzzle him, and no record of the witch\u2019s incantations rewarded his constant search. Sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved musty-smelling lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow, small-paned windows. Here he knew strange things had happened once, and there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that monstrous past might not\u2014at least in the darkest, narrowest, and most intricately crooked alleys\u2014have utterly perished. He also rowed out twice to the ill-regarded island in the river, and made a sketch of the singular angles described by the moss-grown rows of grey standing stones whose origin was so obscure and immemorial. Gilman\u2019s room was of good size but queerly irregular shape; the north wall slanting perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end, while the low ceiling slanted gently downward in the same direction. Aside from an obvious rat-hole and the signs of other stopped-up ones, there was no access\u2014nor any appearance of a former avenue of access\u2014to the space which must have existed between the slanting wall and the straight outer wall on the house\u2019s north side, though a view from the exterior shewed where a window had been boarded up at a very remote date. The loft above the ceiling\u2014which must have had a slanting floor\u2014was likewise inaccessible."}

But then I remembered the stories. The Our cellar watch began at 10 p.m., daylight saving time. As it went on, we saw no sign of important developments. A weak, filtered glow came from the street lamps outside. The rain beat on them. A faint glow came from the hateful fungi inside. This light showed the dripping stone walls. All traces of whitewash had vanished from them. It showed the damp, foul, and mildew-stained hard earth floor. Obscene fungi grew on it. It showed the rotting remains of stools, chairs, and tables. It showed other more shapeless furniture. It showed the heavy planks and big beams of the ground floor above. It showed the old plank door. That door led to bins and rooms under other parts of the house. It showed the crumbling stone staircase. Its wooden handrail was ruined. It shoewd the crude and deep fireplace of blackened brick. Rusted iron pieces showed where hooks, andirons, a spit, a crane. A door to the Dutch oven had been. These things were there. Our simple cot and camp chairs were there. The heavy and complex destructive machines we brought were there. As in my own earlier explorations, we left the street door unlocked. We did this so a direct and practical escape path would be open. We needed it in case of events we could not handle. Our idea was this. Our continued night-time presence would draw out whatever evil being hid there. We were prepared. We could destroy the thing with one of our provided means. We would do this as soon as we saw and studied it enough. We had no idea how long it would take to call out. Destroy the thing. It also occurred to us that our task was far from safe. No one could tell how strogn the thing might appear. But we thought goal was worth the risk. We began it alone and without hesitation. We knew that seeking outside help would only make people laugh at us. It might also ruin our whole purpose. This was our state of mind as we talked. We talked far into the night. My uncle grew sleep.y I reminded him to lie down for his two-hour sleep. A Something-like fear chilled me as I sat there alone in the early hours. I say alone, because one who sits by a sleeper is truly alone. He may be more alone than he knows.\n###\nFor a moment I half doubted that I had ever seen it in the more definitely limned form\u2014but then I thought of the legends. Our cellar vigil began at 10 p.m., daylight saving time, and as it continued we found no promise of pertinent developments. A weak, filtered glow from the rain-harassed street-lamps outside, and a feeble phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within, shewed the dripping stone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished; the dank, foetid, and mildew-tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi; the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, and other more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams of the ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins and chambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircase with ruined wooden hand-rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence of hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven\u2014these things, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricate destructive machinery we had brought. We had, as in my own former explorations, left the door to the street unlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open in case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with. It was our idea that our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever malign entity lurked there; and that being prepared, we could dispose of the thing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we had recognised and observed it sufficiently. How long it might require to evoke and extinguish the thing, we had no notion. It occurred to us, too, that our venture was far from safe; for in what strength the thing might appear no one could tell. But we deemed the game worth the hazard, and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly; conscious that the seeking of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat our entire purpose. Such was our frame of mind as we talked\u2014far into the night, till my uncle\u2019s growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie down for his two-hour sleep. Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours alone\u2014I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone; perhaps more alone than he can realise."}

The mix of words changed to a cry in English. The voice shouted, \" My breath, my breath! \" he became. His expression returned to. My uncle grabbed my hand. He began to tell a dream. I could guess its core meaning with a kind of awe. He said he had floated from dream pictures. He entered a scene whose strangeness was unlike anything he had read. It was of this world, yet not of it. It was a, mixed - up geometry. He could see parts of things. They were in and combinations. There was a sense of disordered pictures. They were laid one on top of another. In this arrangement, the basics of time and space seemed dissolved. They seemed in the way. In this changing vrotex of images, there were snapshots. If one may use the term, they were of clearness. But they were of variety. Once my uncle thought he lay in a dug pit. A crowd of faces frowned down on him. They were framed by hair and three - hats. he seemed to be inside a house. It was an house,. But the details and people kept changing. He could be of the faces or the furniture. He could not be of the room itself. Windows seemed in a state of change as the objects.\n###\nI think, on the whole, that it was this variety which chiefly disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing perturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one but many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself. All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of his mouth and teeth as he spoke. The words were at first indistinguishable, and then\u2014with a tremendous start\u2014I recognised something about them which filled me with icy fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle\u2019s education and the interminable translations he had made from anthropological and antiquarian articles in the Revue des Deux Mondes. For the venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering in French, and the few phrases I could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he had ever adapted from the famous Paris magazine. Suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper\u2019s forehead, and he leaped abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of French changed to a cry in English, and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, \u201cMy breath, my breath!\u201d Then the awakening became complete, and with a subsidence of facial expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began to relate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise with a kind of awe. He had, he said, floated off from a very ordinary series of dream-pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he had ever read. It was of this world, and yet not of it\u2014a shadowy geometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar things in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations. There was a suggestion of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon another; an arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space seemed dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion. In this kaleidoscopic vortex of phantasmal images were occasional snapshots, if one might use the term, of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneity. Once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit, with a crowd of angry faces framed by straggling locks and three-cornered hats frowning down on him. Again he seemed to be in the interior of a house\u2014an old house, apparently\u2014but the details and inhabitants were constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects."}

It had held no box for me. The agent promised,, to start a search. I ended the day by sending Akeley a night - letter that described the situation. With speed, report came from the Boston office the afternoon. The agent telephoned as he learned the facts. It seemed the railway express clerk on No. 5508 could remember an incident that might relate to my loss. There was an argument with a - voiced man. The man was, -, and looked. This happened when the train waited at Keene, N.H., after one o\u2019clock standard time. The man was about a box he claimed to expect. The box was not on the train and not listed in the company \u2019s books. He gave the name Stanley Adams. He had such an, droning voice that it made the clerk. Sleepy to listen. The clerk could not remmeber how the talk ended. But he recalled waking up when the train started to move. The The Boston agent added that this clerk was a man. His honesty and reliability were. His background was known and he had been with the company a time. That evening I went to Boston to talk to the clerk myself. I had gotten his name and address from the office. He was an, fellow. But I saw he could add nothing to his story., he was he could recognize the questioner. Realising that he had no to tell, I returned to Arkham.

I felt the - voiced man who had. affected the clerk must have a role in the business. I hoped that Keene station employees and telegraph - office records might tell something about him. They might tell how he happened to ask when and where he did. I must admit,, that all my investigations led to nothing. The queer - voiced man had been seen around Keene station in the afternoon of July 18. One loiterer seemed to link him with a box. But he was. He had not been seen or.\n###\nTrain No. 5508 had pulled in only 35 minutes late on the day before, but had contained no box addressed to me. The agent promised, however, to institute a searching inquiry; and I ended the day by sending Akeley a night-letter outlining the situation. With commendable promptness a report came from the Boston office on the following afternoon, the agent telephoning as soon as he learned the facts. It seemed that the railway express clerk on No. 5508 had been able to recall an incident which might have much bearing on my loss\u2014an argument with a very curious-voiced man, lean, sandy, and rustic-looking, when the train was waiting at Keene, N.H., shortly after one o\u2019clock standard time. The man, he said, was greatly excited about a heavy box which he claimed to expect, but which was neither on the train nor entered on the company\u2019s books. He had given the name of Stanley Adams, and had had such a queerly thick droning voice, that it made the clerk abnormally dizzy and sleepy to listen to him. The clerk could not remember quite how the conversation had ended, but recalled starting into a fuller awakeness when the train began to move. The Boston agent added that this clerk was a young man of wholly unquestioned veracity and reliability, of known antecedents and long with the company. That evening I went to Boston to interview the clerk in person, having obtained his name and address from the office. He was a frank, prepossessing fellow, but I saw that he could add nothing to his original account. Oddly, he was scarcely sure that he could even recognise the strange inquirer again. Realising that he had no more to tell, I returned to Arkham and sat up till morning writing letters to Akeley, to the express company, and to the police department and station agent in Keene. I felt that the strange-voiced man who had so queerly affected the clerk must have a pivotal place in the ominous business, and hoped that Keene station employees and telegraph-office records might tell something about him and about how he happened to make his inquiry when and where he did. I must admit, however, that all my investigations came to nothing. The queer-voiced man had indeed been noticed around the Keene station in the early afternoon of July 18, and one lounger seemed to couple him vaguely with a heavy box; but he was altogether unknown, and had not been seen before or since."}

It seemed to be from the late 1840s. It had woodwork and marble. Their stained and dirty beauty suggested a fall from a high level of tasteful wealth. The rooms were large and high. They had ugly wallpaper and very fancy plaster moldings. A sad musty smell and a hint of strange cooking lingered. But the floors were clean. The bed sheets were fairly normal. The hot [THING] was not too often cold or shut off. I began to see it as a beaarble place to stay dormant until I could really live again. The landlady was a messy, almost bearded Spanish [THING] named Herrero. She did not bother me with talk. Complain about the electric light I kept on late. My [THING] was on the third [THING] front hall. The other boarders were quiet and kept to themselves as one could wsih. Most were Spaniards, slightly above the roughest and most basic kind. Only the noise of streetcars on the [THING] below was a real bother. I had been there about three weeks when the first strange event happened. One evening around eight, I heard a splattering on the [THING]. I suddenly realized I had been smelling the sharp smell of ammonia for some time. Looking around, I saw the [THING] was wet and dripping. The wetness seemed to come from a corner on the side toward the [THING]. Wanting to stop the problem at its source, I hurried to the basement to tell the landlady. She assured me the trouble would be fixed quickly. \" Doctair Mu\u00f1oz, \" she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me, \" he have speel hees chemicals.

In the rooms, large and lofty, and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices, there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the floors were clean, the linen tolerably regular, and the hot water not too often cold or turned off, so that I came to regard it as at least a bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again. The landlady, a slatternly, almost bearded Spanish woman named Herrero, did not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the late-burning electric light in my third-floor front hall room; and my fellow-lodgers were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire, being mostly Spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade. Only the din of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyance. I had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident occurred. One evening at about eight I heard a spattering on the floor and became suddenly aware that I had been smelling the pungent odour of ammonia for some time. Looking about, I saw that the ceiling was wet and dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street. Anxious to stop the matter at its source, I hastened to the basement to tell the landlady; and was assured by her that the trouble would quickly be set right. \u201cDoctair Mu\u00f1oz,\u201d she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me, \u201che have speel hees chemicals.

Its rich and elegant decoration surprised me in tihs place of dirt and neglect. A folding bed now served as a sofa for the day. The dark wood furniture, expensive curtains, old paintings. Full bookshelves all suggested a gentleman's study, not a rented bedroom. I then realized the room abvoe minewas just doctor's lab. His main living area was in the wide room next door. Its handy alcoves. Large connected bathroom let him hide all dressers. Obvious useful items. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz was clearly a man of good famiyl, education, and taste.\n###\nA rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the hottest of late June, I shivered as I crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness. A folding couch now filled its diurnal role of sofa, and the mahogany furniture, sumptuous hangings, old paintings, and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentleman\u2019s study rather than a boarding-house bedroom. I now saw that the hall room above mine\u2014the \u201cleetle room\u201d of bottles and machines which Mrs. Herrero had mentioned\u2014was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination."}

I could give him joking guesses about the past, he wrote to me about some family legends. This happened when the war sent him to England in 1917. He was an aviation officer. the Delapores had a and history. This was because a friend of my son 's, Capt. Edward Norrys of the Royal Flying Corps, lived near the family home at Anchester. He told some peasant superstitions that writers could match for wildness. Being to believe. Norrys himself, of course, did not take them. But they amused my son and gave him material for his letters to me. It was these legends that turned my attention to my heritage across the Atlantic. They made me decide to buy and fix up the family home. Norrys showed Alfred a picture of it in its abandoned state. He offered to get it for him at a price, since his uncle was the owner. I bought Exham Priory in 1918. But I was pulled from my restoration plans by my son 's return. He came as a and man. For the two years thta he lived, I thought of nothing. Taking care of him. I had put my business under the control of partners. In 1921, I found myself and without purpose. I was a manufacturer who was. I decided to spend my remaining years with my property. Arriving Visiting Anchester in December, I was hosted by Capt. Norrys. He was a, man who had thought of my son. I got his help in collecting plans and stories to guide the coming restoration. I saw Exham Priory itself without feeling. It was a mess of ruins covered with lichen. of rooks ' nests. It was perched on a cliff. It had no floors. features except the stone walls of the towers. As I rebuilt in my mind the image of the building as it was when my ancestor left it over three hundred years, I began to hire workers for the reconstruction. In every case, I had to get people from outside the area. This was because the villagers had an fear. Hatred of the place. This feeling was. that it spread to the workers, causing to quit., its range seemed to include both the priory and its family.\n###\nIt was this boy who reversed the order of family information; for although I could give him only jesting conjectures about the past, he wrote me of some very interesting ancestral legends when the late war took him to England in 1917 as an aviation officer. Apparently the Delapores had a colourful and perhaps sinister history, for a friend of my son\u2019s, Capt. Edward Norrys of the Royal Flying Corps, dwelt near the family seat at Anchester and related some peasant superstitions which few novelists could equal for wildness and incredibility. Norrys himself, of course, did not take them seriously; but they amused my son and made good material for his letters to me. It was this legendry which definitely turned my attention to my transatlantic heritage, and made me resolve to purchase and restore the family seat which Norrys shewed to Alfred in its picturesque desertion, and offered to get for him at a surprisingly reasonable figure, since his own uncle was the present owner. I bought Exham Priory in 1918, but was almost immediately distracted from my plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed invalid. During the two years that he lived I thought of nothing but his care, having even placed my business under the direction of partners. In 1921, as I found myself bereaved and aimless, a retired manufacturer no longer young, I resolved to divert my remaining years with my new possession. Visiting Anchester in December, I was entertained by Capt. Norrys, a plump, amiable young man who had thought much of my son, and secured his assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the coming restoration. Exham Priory itself I saw without emotion, a jumble of tottering mediaeval ruins covered with lichens and honeycombed with rooks\u2019 nests, perched perilously upon a precipice, and denuded of floors or other interior features save the stone walls of the separate towers. As I gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when my ancestor left it over three centuries before, I began to hire workmen for the reconstruction. In every case I was forced to go outside the immediate locality, for the Anchester villagers had an almost unbelievable fear and hatred of the place. This sentiment was so great that it was sometimes communicated to the outside labourers, causing numerous desertions; whilst its scope appeared to include both the priory and its ancient family."}

We were sure the lone tree on Maple Hill had been sturck again. Munroe rose from his box. He went to the window to check the damage. When he took down the shutter, the wind and rain howled deafeningly inside. I could not hear what he said. But I waited while he leaned out. He tried to understand Nature's chaos. Gradually a calming of the wind. A clearing of the unusual darkness told of the storm's passing. I had hoped it would last into the night. This would help our search. But a secret sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed that likelihood. Suggesting to Munroe that we had better get some even if more showers came, I unbarred. Opened the crude door. The ground outside was a mass of mud and pools. There were fresh piles of earth from a landslide. I saw nothing to justify the interest that kept my companion silently leaning out the window. Crossing to where he leaned, I touched his shoulder. But he did not move. Then, as I playfully shook him and turned him around, I felt it. I felt the strangling vines of a cancerous horror. Its roots reached into unlimited pasts and bottomless deeps of the night. This night broods beyond time. On the storm-tossed night of November 8, 1921, I stood with a lantern. It cast deathly shadows. I stood digging alone and foolishly in the grave of Jan Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon because a thunderstorm was brewing. Now.\n###\nAt the same time the wolfish wind rose to daemoniac crescendoes of ululation. We were sure that the lone tree on Maple Hill had been struck again, and Munroe rose from his box and went to the tiny window to ascertain the damage. When he took down the shutter the wind and rain howled deafeningly in, so that I could not hear what he said; but I waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom Nature\u2019s pandemonium. Gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness told of the storm\u2019s passing. I had hoped it would last into the night to help our quest, but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed the likelihood of such a thing. Suggesting to Munroe that we had better get some light even if more showers came, I unbarred and opened the crude door. The ground outside was a singular mass of mud and pools, with fresh heaps of earth from the slight landslide; but I saw nothing to justify the interest which kept my companion silently leaning out the window. Crossing to where he leaned, I touched his shoulder; but he did not move. Then, as I playfully shook him and turned him around, I felt the strangling tendrils of a cancerous horror whose roots reached into illimitable pasts and fathomless abysms of the night that broods beyond time. On the tempest-racked night of November 8, 1921, with a lantern which cast charnel shadows, I stood digging alone and idiotically in the grave of Jan Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon, because a thunderstorm was brewing, and now that it was dark and the storm had burst above the maniacally thick foliage I was glad. I believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August 5th; the daemon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment, and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm. After that thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not understand. I knew that others could not understand either, so let them think Arthur Munroe had wandered away. They searched, but found nothing. The squatters might have understood, but I dared not frighten them more. I myself seemed strangely callous. That shock at the mansion had done something to my brain, and I could think only of the quest for a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination; a quest which the fate of Arthur Munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitary."}

The maan-shaped patch of mold on the floor argued for a connection. The form of the yellowish vapor. The curve of the tree-roots in some old stories also argued for it. They argued for at least a distant and memory-like link to the human shape. No one could say with any certainty how close.

The dream - filled sky lowered itself to the watcher 's window. It mixed with the air of his room. It made him part of its marvel. rivers of violet midnight came to that room. They sparkled with dust. Swirls of dust and fire came from the reaches of space. They were with perfumes from beyond known worlds. oceans flowed. They were lit by suns no eye can see. Their whirlpools held dolphins and sea - nymphs from forgotten depths. Noiseless infinity swirled around the dreamer. It carried him without touching his body. His body stayed stiffly leaning from the window. For days not counted on any calendar, the tides of spheres carried him. They took him to join the dreams he desired. They were the dreams that men have lost. After cycles, they left him sleeping. He slept on a shore at sunrise. The green shore smelled of lotus flowers. It was dotted with water hyacinths. In my ears, a nightmare sound stops. It is a and flapping sound. There is a, - off howling like some hound. This is not a dream. I fear it is not madness. has happened to let me have those doubts. St. John is a and mutilated body. I know why. My knowledge is that I am to shoot myself. I fear I will be torn in the way. Down and hallways of fantasy are swept by the, Nemesis. This force drives me to destroy myself. May heaven forgive the foolishness. Sickness that led us both to such a fate! Wearied with the dullness of an world, where the joys of romance. Adventure become, St. John and I followed every and trend. We sought relief from our crushing boredom. The mysteries of the Symbolists. The joys of the pre - Raphaelites were all for a time. But each interest lost its novelty and appeal. the philosophy of the Decadents could keep our attention. We found it by increasing the depth and evil of our explorations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were used up of their excitement., the stimulation of experiences and adventures remained for us.\n###\nAnd one night a mighty gulf was bridged, and the dream-haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher\u2019s window to merge with the close air of his room and make him a part of their fabulous wonder. There came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold; vortices of dust and fire, swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy with perfumes from beyond the worlds. Opiate oceans poured there, litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and sea-nymphs of unrememberable deeps. Noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men\u2019s calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed; the dreams that men have lost. And in the course of many cycles they tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore; a green shore fragrant with lotus-blossoms and starred by red camalotes. In my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and flapping, and a faint, distant baying as of some gigantic hound. It is not dream\u2014it is not, I fear, even madness\u2014for too much has already happened to give me these merciful doubts. St. John is a mangled corpse; I alone know why, and such is my knowledge that I am about to blow out my brains for fear I shall be mangled in the same way. Down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldritch phantasy sweeps the black, shapeless Nemesis that drives me to self-annihilation. May heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so monstrous a fate! Wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world, where even the joys of romance and adventure soon grow stale, St. John and I had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui. The enigmas of the Symbolists and the ecstasies of the pre-Raphaelites all were ours in their time, but each new mood was drained too soon of its diverting novelty and appeal. Only the sombre philosophy of the Decadents could hold us, and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills, till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures."}

She was the demon heroine of a song. It is not forgotten near Welsh border. Preserved in songs, though not showing the point, is the story of Lady Mary de la Poer. after her marriage to Earl of Shrewsfield, she was killed by him. Both killers were forgiven and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed. They dared not repeat what they told him to the world. These myths and songs, as they were of superstition, disgusted me. Their lasting power. Their connection to such a line of my ancestors, were irritating., the accusations of behavior were to the one known scandal of my ancestors. This was the case of my cousin, Randolph Delapore of Carfax. He went among the negroes. Became a voodoo priest after he returned from the Mexican War. I was bothered by the vaguer tales. These included wails and howls in the, windy valley below the limestone cliff. They included graveyard smells after the spring rains. They included a flopping, squealing thing that Sir John Clave 's horse stepped on one night in a field. They included the servant who went at what he saw in the priory in daylight. These things were ghost story material. I was a skeptic at that time. The stories about missing peasants were to ignore. But they were not considering customs. Prying curiosity meant death. than one cut - off head had been displayed on the battlements. These are gone. They were around Exham Priory. A of the tales were. They made me wish I had learned about comparing myths wehn I was. For instance, there was the belief that a legion of bat - winged devils held Witches ' Sabbath every night at the priory. The food for this legion might explain the amount of vegetables harvested from the gardens. And, of all, there was the story of the rats. This was the running army of disgusting vermin that burst out from the three months after the tragedy that left it deserted. It was the,, starving army that swept everything in its path. It ate birds, cats, dogs, pigs, sheep. two people before its anger faded.\n###\nLady Margaret Trevor from Cornwall, wife of Godfrey, the second son of the fifth baron, became a favourite bane of children all over the countryside, and the daemon heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet extinct near the Welsh border. Preserved in balladry, too, though not illustrating the same point, is the hideous tale of Lady Mary de la Poer, who shortly after her marriage to the Earl of Shrewsfield was killed by him and his mother, both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the world. These myths and ballads, typical as they were of crude superstition, repelled me greatly. Their persistence, and their application to so long a line of my ancestors, were especially annoying; whilst the imputations of monstrous habits proved unpleasantly reminiscent of the one known scandal of my immediate forbears\u2014the case of my cousin, young Randolph Delapore of Carfax, who went among the negroes and became a voodoo priest after he returned from the Mexican War. I was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings in the barren, windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff; of the graveyard stenches after the spring rains; of the floundering, squealing white thing on which Sir John Clave\u2019s horse had trod one night in a lonely field; and of the servant who had gone mad at what he saw in the priory in the full light of day. These things were hackneyed spectral lore, and I was at that time a pronounced sceptic. The accounts of vanished peasants were less to be dismissed, though not especially significant in view of mediaeval custom. Prying curiosity meant death, and more than one severed head had been publicly shewn on the bastions\u2014now effaced\u2014around Exham Priory. A few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque, and made me wish I had learnt more of comparative mythology in my youth. There was, for instance, the belief that a legion of bat-winged devils kept Witches\u2019 Sabbath each night at the priory\u2014a legion whose sustenance might explain the disproportionate abundance of coarse vegetables harvested in the vast gardens. And, most vivid of all, there was the dramatic epic of the rats\u2014the scampering army of obscene vermin which had burst forth from the castle three months after the tragedy that doomed it to desertion\u2014the lean, filthy, ravenous army which had swept all before it and devoured fowl, cats, dogs, hogs, sheep, and even two hapless human beings before its fury was spent."}

I felt more fear than what the concrete slopes, the pillars. The shadows had caused. More fear because of the huge meanings. On a floor three levels below the ground, a mess of confusion happened after the turn that brought me into the building. A vehicle with no clear name had come down from an upper level into a poorly-marked spot. It had done a driving movement. But the workers had blocked the exit in a panic before it could leave.

They are the rats they can never hear. The rats, the rats in the walls. We were sitting on a broken seventeenth-century tomb. It was late afternoon on an autumn day. We were at the old burying-ground in Arkham. We were thinking about the unnameable. Looking toward the giant willow tree in the center of the cemetery. Its turnk has almost swallowed an ancient, unreadable stone. I made a strange remark. I talked about the ghostly and unspeakable food. I said the huge roots must be sucking it from that old, grave-filled earth. My friend scolded me for such nonsense. He told me no burials had happened there for over a century. Nothing could possibly exist to feed the tree in anything but an ordinary way. Besides, he added. My constant talk about \"unnameable\" and \"unspeakable\" things was a very childish trick. It fit my low position as author. I was too fond of ending my stories with sights or sounds. These would paralyze my heroes' minds. It left them without courage, words, or memories to tell what thye had experienced. He said we know things only through our five senses or our religious feelings. Therefore it is quite impossible to talk about any object or sight. It cannot be clearly shown by the solid facts or the correct teachings of religion. Preferably those of the Congregationalists, with whatever changes tradition and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle may add. I had often lazily argued with this friend, Joel Manton. He was the head of the East High School. He was born and raised in Boston. He shared New England's self-satisfied deafness to life's delicate hints. It was his view that only our normal, objective experiences have any artistic meaning. He beliveed the artist's job is not. Much to stir strong feeling by action, joy.

Besides, he added, my constant talk about \u201cunnamable\u201d and \u201cunmentionable\u201d things was a very puerile device, quite in keeping with my lowly standing as an author. I was too fond of ending my stories with sights or sounds which paralysed my heroes\u2019 faculties and left them without courage, words, or associations to tell what they had experienced.

He was principal of the East High School, born and bred in Boston and sharing New England\u2019s self-satisfied deafness to the delicate overtones of life. It was his view that only our normal, objective experiences possess any aesthetic significance, and that it is the province of the artist not so much to rouse strong emotion by action, ecstasy, and astonishment, as to maintain a placid interest and appreciation by accurate, detailed transcripts of every-day affairs. Especially did he object to my preoccupation with the mystical and the unexplained; for although believing in the supernatural much more fully than I, he would not admit that it is sufficiently commonplace for literary treatment."}

I did not move, but I did not selep again that night. In the morning I asked all the servants. I found none of them had noticed anything strange. Only the cook remembered a cat's actions. That cat had rested on her windowsill. It had howled at some unknown hour of the night. This woke the cook. She saw it dart out the open door down the stairs. I drowsed through the noon. In the afternoon I visited Capt again. Norrys became very interested in what I told him. The odd events were small but very curious. They appealed to his sense of the strange. They made him tell many local ghost stories. We were truly puzzled by the rats. Norrys gave me some traps and Paris green. I had the servants put them in key places when I returned. I went to bed early, being very tired. But I was troubled by the most horrible dreams. I seemed to loko down from a great height. I saw a dim cave, knee-deep in filth. A white-bearded demon swineherd was there. He used his staff to drive a group of soft, fungus-like beasts. Their looks filled me with terrible disgust. Then the swinheerd paused and nodded over his work. A huge swarm of rats fell like rain itno the stinking pit. They bgean to eat both the beasts and the man. From this awful vision I was suddenly awakened. Nigger-Man had been sleeping across my feet as usual. This time I did not need to ask why he snarled and hissed. I did not need to ask why fear made him sink his claws into my ankle. He did not know he was doing it. For all around the room the walls were alive with a sickening sound. It was the slithering of huge, hungry rats. Now there was no strange light to show the tapestry's state. The fallen piece had been put back. But I was not too scared to turn on the light. As the bulbs lit up, I saw a horrible shaking all over the tapestry. This made the somewhat odd designs perform a strange dance of death. This movement stopped almost at once. The sound stopped too. I got Springing out of bed. I poked at the tapestry with a long warming-pan handle nearby. I lifted one section to see what was undre it.\n###\nI had not moved, but I did not sleep again that night. In the morning I questioned all the servants, and found that none of them had noticed anything unusual, save that the cook remembered the actions of a cat which had rested on her windowsill. This cat had howled at some unknown hour of the night, awaking the cook in time for her to see him dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs. I drowsed away the noontime, and in the afternoon called again on Capt. Norrys, who became exceedingly interested in what I told him. The odd incidents\u2014so slight yet so curious\u2014appealed to his sense of the picturesque, and elicited from him a number of reminiscences of local ghostly lore. We were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats, and Norrys lent me some traps and Paris green, which I had the servants place in strategic localities when I returned. I retired early, being very sleepy, but was harassed by dreams of the most horrible sort. I seemed to be looking down from an immense height upon a twilit grotto, knee-deep with filth, where a white-bearded daemon swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous, flabby beasts whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing. Then, as the swineherd paused and nodded over his task, a mighty swarm of rats rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man alike. From this terrific vision I was abruptly awaked by the motions of Nigger-Man, who had been sleeping as usual across my feet. This time I did not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses, and of the fear which made him sink his claws into my ankle, unconscious of their effect; for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive with nauseous sound\u2014the verminous slithering of ravenous, gigantic rats. There was now no aurora to shew the state of the arras\u2014the fallen section of which had been replaced\u2014but I was not too frightened to switch on the light. As the bulbs leapt into radiance I saw a hideous shaking all over the tapestry, causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular dance of death. This motion disappeared almost at once, and the sound with it. Springing out of bed, I poked at the arras with the long handle of a warming-pan that rested near, and lifted one section to see what lay beneath."}

The curling mist had thickened again, and was driving ahead with increased speed; whilst the straying penguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying signs of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor confusion when we had passed them. Once more came that sinister, wide-ranged piping\u2014\u201cTekeli-li! Tekeli-li!\u201d We had been wrong. The thing was not wounded, but had merely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the hellish slime inscription above them. We could never know what that daemon message was\u2014but those burials at Lake\u2019s camp had shewn how much importance the beings attached to their dead. Our recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open cavern where various ways converged, and we were glad to be leaving those morbid palimpsest sculptures\u2014almost felt even when scarcely seen\u2014behind. Another thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the possibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large galleries. There were several of the blind albino penguins in the open space, and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was extreme to the point of unaccountability. If at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of travelling need, keeping it strictly in front of us, the frightened squawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our footfalls, screen our true course, and somehow set up a false lead. Amidst the churning, spiralling fog the littered and unglistening floor of the main tunnel beyond this point, as differing from the other morbidly polished burrows, could hardly form a highly distinguishing feature; even, so far as we could conjecture, for those indicated special senses which made the Old Ones partly though imperfectly independent of light in emergencies. In fact, we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves in our haste. For we had, of course, decided to keep straight on toward the dead city; since the consequences of loss in those unknown foothill honeycombings would be unthinkable. The fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on the right one. The penguins alone could not have saved us, but in conjunction with the mist they seem to have done so. Only a benign fate kept the curling vapours thick enough at the right moment, for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish."}

I had known that smell well when I was It had seemed so clean then. I noticed it again in the germ-free waiting room of the city hospital. My granmdother had come from such places. It was there I had to wait among medical scenes. Custodians of that cleanliness had once been in charge of the halls. They mixed and usde the liquids. But those procedures were very exact. So for many years, smell had been steady and the same. After I entered the room, I thought about it often. I told myself how under the bright lights the white walls shone tile by tile with a moon-like paleness. I told myself how the cleaning chemical hung heavily in the still air. It had hung that way for many years before. The nurses praised it for keeping oredr with its chemicals from their bottles. But in tim,e differences came. The nurses stopped praising it. They wrinkled their noses instead as if from a warning. Then I understood a truth. I asked myself to name it. I was uncomfortable in the room with nothing to sense except the notes. Traces it had collected from the nearby wards.\n###\nI had known that peculiar scent well in my youth, where it had seemed so sterile, and had remarked upon it when I encountered it again in the antiseptic waiting room of the municipal hospital. It was from such institutions that my grandmother had come, and it was there that I was forced to endure my vigil among clinical scenes. Custodians of that cleanliness had once presided over the halls and mixed and applied the solutions, but those rituals were very precise, so that for decades the aroma had been constant and unchanging. After I entered the chamber I considered it often, and told myself how under the harsh lights the white walls were gleaming tile by tile with a lunar pallor; how the disinfectant was hanging heavily in the motionless air as it had hung so many years before, and how the nurses praised it for maintaining the order with its chemicals from within their phials. But in time there came nuances, and the nurses ceased to praise it, and wrinkled their noses instead as from a warning. And then I perceived a truth and asked myself to identify it, for I was uneasy in the chamber with nothing to sense save the new undertones and traces it had gathered from the adjacent wards."}

I seemed to find in its magic something I had always known inside or inherited. It was something I had always searched for in vain. Suddenly, after going around a wide angle at the top of a steep clmib, the [THING] stopped. On my left, across a neat lawn that reached the [THING]. Had a border of white - painted stones, stood a white [THING]. It was two and half stories tall, unusually large and elegant for the area. To the right was a group of connected barns, sheds. I knew it at once from the photo I had received. I was not surprised to see the name Henry Akeley on the [THING] mail - box near the [THING]. For some distance behind the [THING], a flat stretch of marshy. Thinly wooded land extended. Beyond that, a steep, thickly forested hillside rose, ending in a jagged, leafy top. I knew this was the top of Dark Mountain. We must have already climbed halfway up it. Alighting from the [THING]. Taking my bag, Noyes asked me to wait. He went in. Told Akeley I had arrived. He added thta he himself had important business elsewhere. Could not stay more than a moment. As he walked quickly up the path to the [THING], I got out of the [THING] myself. I wanted to stretch my legs a little before sitting down for a talk. My feeling of nervousness. Tension had reached its highest point now that I was at the actual place of the sickening siege described. Hauntingly in Akeley 's letters. I honestly feared the coming talks that would link me to such alien. Close contact with the completely bizarre is often more scary than inspiring. It did not cheer me to think this very piece of dusty [THING] was where those monstrous tracks. That foul green fluid wree found after moonless nights of fear.

Truth of that peace which appeared in Akeley 's final. Oddly different letter.\n###\nWe were now burrowing bodily through the midst of the picture, and I seemed to find in its necromancy a thing I had innately known or inherited, and for which I had always been vainly searching. Suddenly, after rounding an obtuse angle at the top of a sharp ascent, the car came to a standstill. On my left, across a well-kept lawn which stretched to the road and flaunted a border of whitewashed stones, rose a white, two-and-a-half-story house of unusual size and elegance for the region, with a congeries of contiguous or arcade-linked barns, sheds, and windmill behind and to the right. I recognised it at once from the snapshot I had received, and was not surprised to see the name of Henry Akeley on the galvanised-iron mail-box near the road. For some distance back of the house a level stretch of marshy and sparsely wooded land extended, beyond which soared a steep, thickly forested hillside ending in a jagged leafy crest. This latter, I knew, was the summit of Dark Mountain, half way up which we must have climbed already. Alighting from the car and taking my valise, Noyes asked me to wait while he went in and notified Akeley of my advent. He himself, he added, had important business elsewhere, and could not stop for more than a moment. As he briskly walked up the path to the house I climbed out of the car myself, wishing to stretch my legs a little before settling down to a sedentary conversation. My feeling of nervousness and tension had risen to a maximum again now that I was on the actual scene of the morbid beleaguering described so hauntingly in Akeley\u2019s letters, and I honestly dreaded the coming discussions which were to link me with such alien and forbidden worlds. Close contact with the utterly bizarre is often more terrifying than inspiring, and it did not cheer me to think that this very bit of dusty road was the place where those monstrous tracks and that foetid green ichor had been found after moonless nights of fear and death. Idly I noticed that none of Akeley\u2019s dogs seemed to be about. Had he sold them all as soon as the Outer Ones made peace with him? Try as I might, I could not have the same confidence in the depth and sincerity of that peace which appeared in Akeley\u2019s final and queerly different letter."}

The table-like stone stands there among its mound of bones. Considerable talk began when Silas Bsihop, from the undecayed Bishops, mentioned seeing the boy running strongly up that hill ahead of his mother. This was about an hour before the fire was noticed. Silas was gathering a stray cow. He nearly forgot his task when he briefly saw the two figures in the dim of his lantern. They moved almost silently through the underbrush. The surprised watcher seemed to think thye were completely naked. Afterward he could not be sure about the boy. The boy may have had some kind of fringed belt. A pair of shorts. Wilbur was never later seen alive and awake without and tightly buttoned clothing. Any messing up. Threat of messing up his clothes always seemed to fill him with anger. His difference from his dirty mother and grandfather in this way was thought very notable. This was until the horror of 1928 suggested the best reason. The next Januayr, gossips were mildly interested that \"Lavinny's black child\" had started to talk. He was only eleven months His speech was somewhat remarkable. This was both because it was different from the normal accents of the area. Because it showed no baby lisp. Many children of three or four could be proud of such clear speech. The boy did not talk much. When he spoke, he seemed to sohw some hard-to-grasp quality completely lacking in Dunwich. The strangeness was not in what he said. Even in the simple phrases he used. It seemed vaguely connected to his tone of voice. To the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His face was also remakrable for its maturity. Though he shared his mother's. Grandfather's lack of chin, his firm. Early-shaped nose combiend with the look in his almost Latin eyes. This gave him an air of near-adulthood and almost supernatural intelligence. However, he was very despite his look of brightness. There was something almost goat-like. Animal about his lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse curly hair. Strangely ears.\n###\nIt was somewhat after this time\u2014on Hallowe\u2019en\u2014that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop\u2014of the undecayed Bishops\u2014mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons. The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that \u201cLavinny\u2019s black brat\u201d had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears."}

The sea began to rise in a threatening way. Atfer we closed our hatches, we waited to see what would happen. We realized we must go underwater or the growing waves would flodo us. Both the air pressure and the electrical charge were dropping. We wanted to save our limited mechanical power. But in this situation, we had no other option. We did not go down very deep.

This was true even though the mechanics tried everything. The crew became more scared of being trapped under the sea. SSome of them started to whisper again about Lieut and Klenze's ivory statue.

We did not descend far, and when after several hours the sea was calmer, we decided to return to the surface.

As the men grew more frightened at this undersea imprisonment, some of them began to mutter again about Lieut. Klenze\u2019s ivory image, but the sight of an automatic pistol calmed them.

Its pages were spread open in a strange way. The unlucky man was middle-aged, somewhat pale, and very serious. He was likely from the money department. He was certainly from the local office's group of workers. He had clearly tried to hide in the very meeting that had to ignore his own needs. He was just one more persno hurt by the never-ending plans for efficiency. The company bosses are using these plans against all the departments. Our's group looked through the notebook for notes. They found a very strange little drawing in the edges. It was a sketch meant to show a manager's head with cables on it like a crown.

Moved, he tried to remember what he saw after the scene at the far counter. Nothing clear would form in his mind. That scene must have matched the locked office behind the wall. That office had started to test his patience very deeply. But later memories were weak and unclear. There were hints of vague, fluorescent-lit deep spaces. There were hints of even larger, more bueraucratic deep spaces beyond them. These were deep spaces where any fixed ideas of order were missing. The crowded line and the number ticket that always followed him had taken him there. They, like him, had turned into pieces of dull, barely felt boredom in this further empty space of final waiting. Something else had gone ahead. It was a larger piece that sometimes formed into nameless shapes almost like a person. He thought their movement was not in a straight line. Instead, it was along the strange curves and spirals of some office whirlpool. This wihrlpool followed rules unnkown to the logic and reason of any possible government system. Eventually there had been a hint of hgue, moving shadows behind frosted glass. There was a hint of a huge, half-heard mumbling. There was the thin, steady sound of an unseen intercom. But that was all. Wilkins decided he got that last idea from what he read in the strange rules. The rules were about the mindless thing Director Thoth. This thing controls all licenses. Forms from a strangely strong gray desk at the center of the maze.\n###\nAs he shuffled and adjusted his posture he attempted to recollect what he had observed after the scene at the distant counter, but nothing distinct would coalesce in his thoughts. That scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed office beyond the partition, which had begun to afflict his patience so profoundly, but subsequent impressions were faint and nebulous. There were suggestions of the vague, fluorescent-lit abysses, and of still vaster, more bureaucratic abysses beyond them\u2014abysses in which all fixed suggestions of order were absent. He had been conveyed there by the queue-congeries and the numbered ticket which ever dogged him; but they, like himself, had transmuted into wisps of dull, barely tangible ennui in this farther void of ultimate waiting. Something else had proceeded ahead\u2014a larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of human form\u2014and he fancied that their progress had not been in a straight line, but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some administrative vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the logic and reason of any conceivable civic order. Eventually there had been a hint of vast, shifting shadows behind frosted glass, of a monstrous, half-audible murmuring, and of the thin, monotonous piping of an unseen intercom\u2014but that was all.

Two inches thick. The thin [THING] covers opened at the top. Its tough cellulose pages seemed untouched by the countless cycles of time they had lived through. I studied the strangely colored, brush - drawn letters of the text. The symbols were completely unlike the usual cuvred picture writing. Any alphabet known to human learning. I felt a haunting, half - awakened memory. It came to me that this was the language used by a trapped mind I had known a little in my dreams. That mind was from a large asteroid. Much of the ancient life and knowledge from the original planet had survived there. The asterodi was a piece of that planet. At the same time, I remembered that this level of the record halls was for books dealing with planets not from Earth. I stopped looking closely at this unbelievable document. I saw that my torchlight was starting to fade. So I quickly put in the extra battery I always carried with me. Then, with the stronger light, I started my feverish running again. I ran through endless tangles of walkways and hallways. Now and then I recognized some familiar shelf. I was vaguely bothered by the sound conditions. They made my footsteps echo wrongly in these underground tombs of death. Silence that had lasted for ages. The very marks of my shose behind me in the dust, untouched for thousands of years, made me shake. Never before, if my mad dreams held any truth, had human feet stepped on those ancient floors. My conscious mind held no cule about the specific goal of my insane running. However, some force of evil power pulled at my confused will and buried memories. So I vaguely felt I was not running without aim. I came to a downward slope and followed it to deeper levels. Floors flashed by me as I ran. I did not stop to look at them. In my spinning brain, a certain rhythm had begun to beat. It made my right [THING] twitch in time with it. I wanted to unlock something. I felt that I knew all the complicated twists and pressures needed to do it. It would be like a modern safe with a combination lock. Dream or not, I had once known and still knew.

Its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they had lived through, and I studied the queerly pigmented, brush-drawn letters of the text\u2014symbols utterly unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet known to human scholarship\u2014with a haunting, half-aroused memory. It came to me that this was the language used by a captive mind I had known slightly in my dreams\u2014a mind from a large asteroid on which had survived much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet whereof it formed a fragment. At the same time I recalled that this level of the archives was devoted to volumes dealing with the non-terrestrial planets. As I ceased poring over this incredible document I saw that the light of my torch was beginning to fail, hence quickly inserted the extra battery I always had with me. Then, armed with the stronger radiance, I resumed my feverish racing through unending tangles of aisles and corridors\u2014recognising now and then some familiar shelf, and vaguely annoyed by the acoustic conditions which made my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs of aeon-long death and silence. The very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden dust made me shudder. Never before, if my mad dreams held anything of truth, had human feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements. Of the particular goal of my insane racing, my conscious mind held no hint. There was, however, some force of evil potency pulling at my dazed will and buried recollections, so that I vaguely felt I was not running at random. I came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths. Floors flashed by me as I raced, but I did not pause to explore them. In my whirling brain there had begun to beat a certain rhythm which set my right hand twitching in unison. I wanted to unlock something, and felt that I knew all the intricate twists and pressures needed to do it. It would be like a modern safe with a combination lock.

This letter-reading distraction, along with the ghostly alerts related to the financial quarter's end, produced something in me last Thursday afternoon.

I closed the [THING] behind me. I went down the dripping steps by the light of my single candle. I seemed to know the way. Even though the candle sputtered in the stifling smell of the place, I felt strangely at home in the musty, death - [THING] air. Looking around me, I saw many marble slabs holding coffins or coffin remains. Some were sealed and whole. Others had almost disappeared, leaving silver handles and plates among odd piles of whitish dust. On one plate I read the name of Sir Geoffrey Hyde. He came from Sussex in 1640 and died here a few years later. In a noticeable alcove was one fairly well - preserved and empty coffin. It had a single name that made me both smile and shudder.

Locked the chain on the [THING] behind me. I was no longer a young [THING], even though only twenty - one winters had chilled my [THING]. Early - rising villagers who saw me walking home looked at me strangely. They wondered at the signs of wild partying they saw in someone known to be sober. I did not see my parents until after a long and refreshing sleep. Henceforward I visited the tomb every night. I saw, heard, and did things I must never tell. My speech, always easily influenced by my surroundings, was the first thing to change. [THING] soon noticed my suddenly old - fashioned way of talking. Later a strange boldness and carelessness came into my behavior. Without realizing it, I began to act like a [THING] of the world, despite my lifelong isolation. My once silent tongue became talkative. I spoke with the easy grace of a Chesterfield. The godless cynicism of a Rochester. I showed a peculiar knowledge completely unlike the weird, monkish learning I had studied in youth. I covered my books ' blank pages with quic,k improvised poems. These brought to mind Gay, Prior, and the liveliest of the Augustan wits and poets. One morning at breakfast, I almost caused trouble. I recited a piece of eighteenth - century Bacchanalian fun in clearly drunken accent. It was a bit of Georgian playfulness never written in a [THING]. It went something like this.\n###\nA spell was upon me, and my heart leaped with an exultation I can but ill describe. As I closed the door behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle, I seemed to know the way; and though the candle sputtered with the stifling reek of the place, I felt singularly at home in the musty, charnel-house air. Looking about me, I beheld many marble slabs bearing coffins, or the remains of coffins. Some of these were sealed and intact, but others had nearly vanished, leaving the silver handles and plates isolated amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust. Upon one plate I read the name of Sir Geoffrey Hyde, who had come from Sussex in 1640 and died here a few years later. In a conspicuous alcove was one fairly well-preserved and untenanted casket, adorned with a single name which brought to me both a smile and a shudder. An odd impulse caused me to climb upon the broad slab, extinguish my candle, and lie down within the vacant box. In the grey light of dawn I staggered from the vault and locked the chain of the door behind me. I was no longer a young man, though but twenty-one winters had chilled my bodily frame. Early-rising villagers who observed my homeward progress looked at me strangely, and marvelled at the signs of ribald revelry which they saw in one whose life was known to be sober and solitary. I did not appear before my parents till after a long and refreshing sleep. Henceforward I haunted the tomb each night; seeing, hearing, and doing things I must never reveal. My speech, always susceptible to environmental influences, was the first thing to succumb to the change; and my suddenly acquired archaism of diction was soon remarked upon. Later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour, till I unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion. My formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a Chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a Rochester. I displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic, monkish lore over which I had pored in youth; and covered the flyleaves of my books with facile impromptu epigrams which brought up suggestions of Gay, Prior, and the sprightliest of the Augustan wits and rimesters. One morning at breakfast I came close to disaster by declaiming in palpably liquorish accents an effusion of eighteenth-century Bacchanalian mirth; a bit of Georgian playfulness never recorded in a book, which ran something like this."}

I moved carefully over the surface of every slice big enough to possibly be the base of the morning meal. I paid special attention to the wide surfaces of bread loaves that were left. I became very agitated after about a minute. On a dark area near the center of a particularly holey breakfast slice, I was sure the color from applying concentrated heat was noticeably darker.

How the guardian night - gaunts would suddenly jump on him. This was if any were indeed stationed in this ancient passage. All about him was a chkoing smell of lower chasms. He felt that air of these suffocating depths was not made for humankind. In time he became very numb and sleepy. He moved more from automatic habit than from conscious will. He did not realize any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly grabbed him from behind. He was flying very fast through the air before a mean tickling told him that the rubbery night - gaunts had done their duty.

All about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs, and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not made for mankind. In time he became very numb and somnolent, moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will; nor did he realise any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind. He was flying very rapidly through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery night-gaunts had performed their duty. Awaked to the fact that he was in the cold, damp clutch of the faceless flutterers, Carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight. Mindless though night-gaunts are said to be, the effect was instantaneous; for all tickling stopped at once, and the creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position. Thus encouraged, Carter ventured some explanations; telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by the moon-beasts, and of the need of assembling a party to rescue them. The night-gaunts, though inarticulate, seemed to understand what was said; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight. Suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth, and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw. Scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place; and as Carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons, a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery, dog-like tenants. The night-gaunts now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet, afterward withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer. Carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company, and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for the rescue. After a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared, and made significant signs to the night-gaunts, causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark."}

I found none of them had noticed anything. the cook remembered a cat 's actions. That cat had rested on her windowsill. It had howled at some huor of the night. This woke the cook. She saw it dart out the door down the stairs. I drowsed through the noon. In the afternoon I visited Capt. Norrys became in what I told him. The events were but. They appealed to his sense of the strange. They maed him tell ghost stories. We were puzzled by the rats. Norrys gave me some traps and Paris. I had the servants put them in places when I returned. I went to bed, being. But I was troubled by the dreams. I seemed to look down from a height. I saw a cave, knee - in filth. A - demon swineherd was. He used his staff to drive a group of, fungus - beasts. Their looks filled me with disgust. the swineherd paused and nodded over his work. A swarm of rats fell like rain into the stinking pit. They began to eat both the beasts and the man. From this vision I was awakened. Nigger - Man had been sleeping across my feet as. This time I did not need to ask why he snarled and hissed. I did not need to ask why fear made him sink his claws into my ankle. He did not know he was doing it. For around the room the walls were with a sickening sound. It was the slithering of, rats. there was no light to show the tapestry 's state. The piece had been put. But I was not to turn on the light. As the bulbs lit up, I saw a shaking over the tapestry. This made the designs perform a dance of death. Thsi movement stopped at. The sound stopped. I got Springing out of bed. I poked at the tapestry with a warming - pan handle. I litfed one section to see what was under it.\n###\nI had not moved, but I did not sleep again that night. In the morning I questioned all the servants, and found that none of them had noticed anything unusual, save that the cook remembered the actions of a cat which had rested on her windowsill. This cat had howled at some unknown hour of the night, awaking the cook in time for her to see him dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs. I drowsed away the noontime, and in the afternoon called again on Capt. Norrys, who became exceedingly interested in what I told him. The odd incidents\u2014so slight yet so curious\u2014appealed to his sense of the picturesque, and elicited from him a number of reminiscences of local ghostly lore. We were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats, and Norrys lent me some traps and Paris green, which I had the servants place in strategic localities when I returned. I retired early, being very sleepy, but was harassed by dreams of the most horrible sort. I seemed to be looking down from an immense height upon a twilit grotto, knee-deep with filth, where a white-bearded daemon swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous, flabby beasts whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing. Then, as the swineherd paused and nodded over his task, a mighty swarm of rats rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man alike. From this terrific vision I was abruptly awaked by the motions of Nigger-Man, who had been sleeping as usual across my feet. This time I did not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses, and of the fear which made him sink his claws into my ankle, unconscious of their effect; for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive with nauseous sound\u2014the verminous slithering of ravenous, gigantic rats. There was now no aurora to shew the state of the arras\u2014the fallen section of which had been replaced\u2014but I was not too frightened to switch on the light. As the bulbs leapt into radiance I saw a hideous shaking all over the tapestry, causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular dance of death. This motion disappeared almost at once, and the sound with it. Springing out of bed, I poked at the arras with the long handle of a warming-pan that rested near, and lifted one section to see what lay beneath."}

Remember carefully that I did not see any real magazine horror in thta waiting room. To say that mental boredom caused what I guessed is to ingore the clearest facts of my last watch. That last thing made me run from the plain city office. I went through the maze-like halls of paperwork in a state of upset and unrest. Notwithstanding the extent to which I shared the information. Guesses of the other waiting people, the things I saw. The admitted clearness of the boredom these things made in me, I still cannot prove if I was right. Wrong in my sad guess.

There was no sign that those awflu gossip pages. news sheets had been placde with any purpose. That the people there had greatly feared the crowded vinyl chairs. Endless slow pass of minutes.

Notwithstanding the deep extent to which I shared the information and speculations of the other detainees, the things I saw and perused, and the admitted vividness of the ennui produced on me by these things, I cannot prove even now whether I was right or wrong in my dismal inference.

It was just as though some indifferent hand had placed them there casually for the torment of the waiting and failed to update them. There was not even a sign that a recent reader had been there, or that those horrible gossip columns and outdated bulletins had been arranged with any malign intent. That the occupants had mortally feared the crowded vinyl chairs and endless trickle of minutes among which they had been trapped and resigned, means nothing at all, either; for thousands are subject to just such morbid resignations. Eccentricity, moreover, could easily account for the strange neglect and apprehensions toward the replenishment of the rack."}

The blocking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed recently half-cleared. We quickly decided this was the route the others used to go down. This would be the logical route for us to go up. This was despite the long paper trail we left elsewhere. The tower's opening was no farther from the foothills. Our waiting plane than the big terraced building we entered. Any further exploration under the ice on this trip would be in this general area. Odldy, we were still thinking about possible later trips. This was even after all we had seen and guessed. Then, as we carefully walked over the debris on the big floor, we saw something. This sight pushed all other thoughts away for the moment. It was the neat, grouped line of three sledges. They were in that farther corner of the ramp's lower, outward-reaching path. This spot had been hidden from our view until now. There they were. They were the three sledges missing from Lake's camp. They sohwed signs of hard use. This must have included forced dragging over long stretches of snowless stone and debris. It also included much carrying by hand over completely impassable places. They were packed and strapped carefully and smartly. They contained very familiar things. There was the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument cases, food tins, and tarps. Some tarps clearly bulged with books. Others bulged with less obvious contents. Everything came from Lake's equipment. After what we found in that other romo, we were somewhat ready for this find. The real great shock came when we stepped over and opened one tarp. Its shape had strangely disturbed us. It seems others besides Lake had been interested in collecting typical samples. For there were two here. Both were stiffly frozen and perfectly preserved. They had adhesive plaster patches where some neck wounds were. They wree wrapped with obvious care to prevent more damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog. Many people will probably think us cold and crazy. They will think this because we thought about the north tunnel. Soon after our grim discovrey. I am not ready to say we would have thought those thoughts again right away. But a specific event happened to us. It started a whole new line of thinking.\n###\nAs it was, the ramp shewed sad battering; whilst the choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently half-cleared. It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere. The tower\u2019s mouth was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered, and any further sub-glacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie in this general region. Oddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips\u2014even after all we had seen and guessed. Then as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time excluded all other matters. It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramp\u2019s lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view. There they were\u2014the three sledges missing from Lake\u2019s camp\u2014shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places. They were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and contained things memorably familiar enough\u2014the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging with books, and some bulging with less obvious contents\u2014everything derived from Lake\u2019s equipment. After what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for this encounter. The really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with patent care to prevent further damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog. Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our sombre discovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations."}

The shining columns of that large hall where Musides HAD dreamed. Worked no longer rose amogn the olive trees. Lone and shaken people mounred the simple courtyards and the lower walls. The heavy hagning branch of the strange new tree had fallen directly on the luxurious main columned area. It turned the grand marble structure into a pile of ugly runis wiht odd thhoroughness. Strangers and Tegeans stood shocked. They looked from the wreckage to the large, threatening tree. Its appearance was weirdly like a human. Its roots reached in a odd way into the carved tomb of Kalos. Their fear and distress grew when they searched the fallen room. They could find no sign of the gentle Musides. The wonderfully made statue of Tych\u00e9. Only chaos lived in Amidst suuch enormous ruin. The representatives of two cities left disappointed. Syracusans were sad they had no sattue to carry home.

Slaves\u2019 cries ascended from a scene of desolation, and no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that vast hall wherein Musides had dreamed and toiled. Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peristyle had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins. Strangers and Tegeans stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of Kalos. And their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment; for of the gentle Musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of Tych\u00e9, no trace could be discovered. Amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt, and the representatives of two cities left disappointed; Syracusans that they had no statue to bear home, Tegeans that they had no artist to crown. However, the Syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue in Athens, and the Tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora a marble temple commemorating the gifts, virtues, and brotherly piety of Musides."}

But I put together some different pieces of meat and plants. I placed them inside the bread. I remember deciding to add an apple right away. I also decided to wrap the whole thing in a wax paper covering. I added that I would get a thermos of coffee. This would help make the meal stronger against the dullness of noon. It was also smart, I think I thought, to protect the contents from slow staleness that attacks such food. It can be seen that at this moment of making it, my own belief in the meal being enough was almost total. I did think my mistake in not including a good sauce was not because the supplies were mysteriously lacking. It was because of some distracted failure of my own mind.\n###\nThe sandwich frankly plunged me into the most profound of deliberations. I did not know what to select for the filling, but assembled some disparate components of meat and vegetation and placed them within the bread.

It will be observed that at this moment of preparation my own conviction in the adequacy of the assembled meal was virtually complete, though I did think my failure to include a suitable condiment was due not to any arcane deficiency of the larder but to some distracted lapse of my own faculties."}

While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlight January night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the Turk\u2019s Head.

It was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory.

They had given up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source.

On neither occasion, though, had Gilman been there\u2014and when told of the matter he wondered where he could have been wandering, barefoot and with only his night-clothes on.

Mazurewicz had told long, rambling stories about the ghost of old Keziah and the furry, sharp-fanged, nuzzling thing, and had said he was so badly haunted at times that only his silver crucifix\u2014given him for the purpose by Father Iwanicki of St. Stanislaus\u2019 Church\u2014could bring him relief."}

The [THING] grew stronger. The air filled with the deadly, grave - like smell of towns struck by plague. As we sailed wildly away from that cursed coast, the bearded [THING] finally spoke. He said: \" This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained. \". Once again the White Ship followed the [THING] from heaven. We sailed over warm, blessed seas. Gentle, sweet - smelling breezes fanned us. We sailed day after day and night after night. When the [THING] was full, we would listen to the soft songs of the rowers. They were as sweet as on that far - off night when we sailed away from my distant homeland. We finally anchored by moonlight in the harbor of Sona - Nyl. Twin crystal headlands guard it. They rise from the [THING] and meet in a shining arch. This is the Lnad of Fancy. We walked to the green shore on a golden bridge of moonlight. In the Land of Sona - Nyl there is no time or space. There is no suffering or death. I lived there for many ages. The groves and fields are Green. The flowers are bright and fragrant. The streams are blue and sound liek music. The fountains are clear and cool. The temples, castles, and cities of Sona - Nyl are grand and beautiful. That land has no end. Beyond each beautiful view rises another more beautiful one. Over the countryside and among the splendor of cities, happy [THING] wander freely. All of them have perfect grace and pure happiness. For the ages I lived there, I wandered happily through gardens. Quaint pagodas peek from nice clumps of bushes there. The white paths are lined with delicate flowers. I climbed gentle hills. From their tops I could see charming wide views of beauty. Towns with steeples nestled in green valleys. The golden domes of huge cities glittered on the very far horizon. I saw the sparkling [THING], the crystal headlands, and the calm harbor by moonlight. The White Ship lay anchored in the harbor. One night in the ancient year of Tharp, I saw the shape of the heavenly [THING] against the full [THING]. I felt the first feelings of restlessness. Then I spoke with the bearded [THING]. I told him of my new desire to leave for distant Cathuria. No [THING] has seen it. All believe it lies beyond the basalt pillars of the West.\n###\nThe wind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the lethal, charnel odour of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries. And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, saying: \u201cThis is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained.\u201d So once more the White Ship followed the bird of heaven, over warm blessed seas fanned by caressing, aromatic breezes. Day after day and night after night did we sail, and when the moon was full we would listen to soft songs of the oarsmen, sweet as on that distant night when we sailed away from my far native land. And it was by moonlight that we anchored at last in the harbour of Sona-Nyl, which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent arch. This is the Land of Fancy, and we walked to the verdant shore upon a golden bridge of moonbeams. In the Land of Sona-Nyl there is neither time nor space, neither suffering nor death; and there I dwelt for many aeons. Green are the groves and pastures, bright and fragrant the flowers, blue and musical the streams, clear and cool the fountains, and stately and gorgeous the temples, castles, and cities of Sona-Nyl. Of that land there is no bound, for beyond each vista of beauty rises another more beautiful. Over the countryside and amidst the splendour of cities rove at will the happy folk, of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and unalloyed happiness. For the aeons that I dwelt there I wandered blissfully through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes, and where the white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms. I climbed gentle hills from whose summits I could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness, with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys, and with the golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon. And I viewed by moonlight the sparkling sea, the crystal headlands, and the placid harbour wherein lay anchored the White Ship. It was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of Tharp that I saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird, and felt the first stirrings of unrest. Then I spoke with the bearded man, and told him of my new yearnings to depart for remote Cathuria, which no man hath seen, but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the West."}

I can not reveal the details of our shocking trips. I can not list even a part of the worst trophies that decorated the unnamed museum we set up. We prepraed it in the large [THING] [THING] where we lived together, alone. Our museum was a blasphemous, unthinkable place. With the devilish taste of neurotic experts, we had gathered a universe of terror. We did this to excite our tired senses. It was a secret [THING], very far underground. Huge winged demons craved from basalt and onyx were there. They vomited strange geren and orange light from wide, grinning mouths. Hidden air pipes made lnies of red, skeletal things dance. These things were woven [THING] - in - [THING] into large black hangings. The dances were like shifting patterns of death. Through these pipes came smells our moods most desired. Sometimes it was the scent of pale funeral lilies. Sometimes it was the drugging incense of imagined Eastern shrines for royal dea.d Sometimesit was the awful, soul - shaking stench of an opened grave. Around the walls of this disgusting [THING] were cases. They held ancient mummies. These atlernated with attractive, lifelike bodies. The bodies were perfectly stuffed and preserved by taxidermy. There were also tombstones taken from the world 's oledst churchyards. Niches here and there held skulls of all shapes. They also held heads preserved at different stages of decay. There one might find the rotting, bald heads of famous nobles. One might also find the fresh, shining golden heads of recently buried children. Statues and paintings were there. All had fiendish subjects. Some were made by St. John and myself. A locked portfolio, bound in tanned human skin, held certain unknown and unnameable drawings. It was rumored Goya had made them but did not dare admit it. There were sickening musical instruments: string, brass, and woodwind. St. John and I sometimes played them. We produced discordant sounds of exquisite sickness and devilish horror. Meanwhile, in mayn inlaid ebony cabinets rested the most unbelievable variety of loot from tombs. This collection was ever assembled by human madness and perversion.\n###\nOnly the sombre philosophy of the Decadents could hold us, and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills, till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures. It was this frightful emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable course which even in my present fear I mention with shame and timidity\u2014that hideous extremity of human outrage, the abhorred practice of grave-robbing. I cannot reveal the details of our shocking expeditions, or catalogue even partly the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum we prepared in the great stone house where we jointly dwelt, alone and servantless. Our museum was a blasphemous, unthinkable place, where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we had assembled an universe of terror and decay to excite our jaded sensibilities. It was a secret room, far, far underground; where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light, and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the lines of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black hangings. Through these pipes came at will the odours our moods most craved; sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies, sometimes the narcotic incense of imagined Eastern shrines of the kingly dead, and sometimes\u2014how I shudder to recall it!\u2014the frightful, soul-upheaving stenches of the uncovered grave. Around the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique mummies alternating with comely, life-like bodies perfectly stuffed and cured by the taxidermist\u2019s art, and with headstones snatched from the oldest churchyards of the world. Niches here and there contained skulls of all shapes, and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution. There one might find the rotting, bald pates of famous noblemen, and the fresh and radiantly golden heads of new-buried children. Statues and paintings there were, all of fiendish subjects and some executed by St. John and myself. A locked portfolio, bound in tanned human skin, held certain unknown and unnamable drawings which it was rumoured Goya had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge. There were nauseous musical instruments, stringed, brass, and wood-wind, on which St. John and I sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and cacodaemoniacal ghastliness; whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony cabinets reposed the most incredible and unimaginable variety of tomb-loot ever assembled by human madness and perversity."}

Prior to that time he had made up for the prosiness of life by nightly excursions to strange and ancient cities beyond space, and lovely, unbelievable garden lands across ethereal seas; but as middle age hardened upon him he felt these liberties slipping away little by little, until at last he was cut off altogether. No more could his galleys sail up the river Oukranos past the gilded spires of Thran, or his elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in Kled, where forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns sleep lovely and unbroken under the moon. He had read much of things as they are, and talked with too many people. Well-meaning philosophers had taught him to look into the logical relations of things, and analyse the processes which shaped his thoughts and fancies. Wonder had gone away, and he had forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain, among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings, and no cause to value the one above the other. Custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that which tangibly and physically exists, and had made him secretly ashamed to dwell in visions. Wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and childish, and he believed it because he could see that they might easily be so. What he failed to recall was that the deeds of reality are just as inane and childish, and even more absurd because their actors persist in fancying them full of meaning and purpose as the blind cosmos grinds aimlessly on from nothing to something and from something back to nothing again, neither heeding nor knowing the wishes or existence of the minds that flicker for a second now and then in the darkness. They had chained him down to things that are, and had then explained the workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world. When he complained, and longed to escape into twilight realms where magic moulded all the little vivid fragments and prized associations of his mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and unquenchable delight, they turned him instead toward the new-found prodigies of science, bidding him find wonder in the atom\u2019s vortex and mystery in the sky\u2019s dimensions."}

These were all linked to forces in this piece of land. They deserved the protection. I intend to show you some results of these arts and discoveries. I will do this in the secrecy. I trust my judgment of people. I have no doubt about your interest or your loyalty. \" He stopped. I could nod. I said I was. to my soul, the daylight world of New York felt. Whether this man was a person. A user of arts, I had no choice. I had to follow him. I had to satisfy my curiosity with whatever he might show. I lsitened. \" To my ancsetor, \" he continued, \" human will seemed to have qualities. These qualities had an power. This power was not over one 's actions and the actions of others. It was over every kind of force and substanec in Nature. It was over elements and dimensions considered than Nature itself. Should I say he mocked the sacredness of things as space and time? Sohuld I say he used the rituals of - blood Indians in ways? Those people camped on this hill. These Indians showed anger when the place was built. They were in asking to visit the grounds at the moon. For years, they stole over the wall each month when they could. They performed acts., in 1768, the squire caught them in the act. He stood at what he saw. After that, he made a deal with them. He gave them access to his grounds. In exchange, he learned the details of what they did. He learned that their grandfathers got part of their practice from ancestors. They got another part from an Dutchman from the time of the States - General. And curse him, I fear the squire must have given them rum. It might have been on purpose or not. A week after he learned the secret, he was the living man who knew it.\n###\nThere were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family, and I have not been remiss in discharging such obligations. The squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding. Some curious effects of these arts and discoveries I now purpose to shew you, under the strictest secrecy; and I believe I may rely on my judgment of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelity.\u201d He paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was alarmed, yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of New York, and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts I had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to offer. So I listened. \u201cTo\u2014my ancestor\u2014\u201d he softly continued, \u201cthere appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a little-suspected dominance not only over the acts of one\u2019s self and of others, but over every variety of force and substance in Nature, and over many elements and dimensions deemed more univarsal than Nature herself. May I say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time, and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half-breed red Indians once encamped upon this hill? These Indians shewed choler when the place was built, and were plaguy pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon. For years they stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth performed sartain acts. Then, in \u201968, the new squire catched them at their doings, and stood still at what he saw. Thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did; larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old Dutchman in the time of the States-General. And pox on him, I\u2019m afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum\u2014whether or not by intent\u2014for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it."}

I read hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my vision led me. I pushed through gateways of space. Life patterns toward the core of the universe. I remember the nigth I made five circles of fire on the floor. I stood in the one. I chanted that prayer the messenger from Tartary had brought. The walls melted. A wind swept me through spaces of grey. Needle - peaks of mountains were miles below me. After a while there was blackness. came the light of stars. They formed, constellations. I saw a - lit below me. I saw on it the towers of a city. It was built in a way I had known. As I floated to that city, I saw a stone building in an space. A fear grabbed at me. I screamed and struggled. After a period, I was in my room. I was sprawled over the five circles on the floor. That night 's journey had no strangeness than nights ' journeys. But it had terror. I knew I was to those depths. Worlds than I had been. I was with my chants. I did not want to be cut off from my body and from earth. I did not want to be lost in abysses from which I could return. After twenty - two years of nightmare. Terror, saved by a belief in the source of feelings, I will not swear to the truth of what I think I found in Western Australia on the night of July 17\u201318, 1935. There is reason to hope my experience was or a hallucination. Plenty of causes existed for that. Yet its realism was that I find hope. If the thing did happen, man must be to accept ideas of the cosmos. He must accept ideas of his place in the boiling whirlpool of time. The mention of these ideas is paralyzing. He must be warned against a hidden danger. This danger will swallow the race. But it may place and horrors upon members of it.\n###\nDogs had a fear of me, for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side. But still I read more\u2014in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me\u2014and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and life-patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos. I remember the night I made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor, and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from Tartary had brought. The walls melted away, and I was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the needle-like pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me. After a while there was utter blackness, and then the light of myriad stars forming strange, alien constellations. Finally I saw a green-litten plain far below me, and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in no fashion I had ever known or read of or dreamed of. As I floated closer to that city I saw a great square building of stone in an open space, and felt a hideous fear clutching at me. I screamed and struggled, and after a blankness was again in my attic room, sprawled flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor. In that night\u2019s wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a former night\u2019s wandering; but there was more of terror because I knew I was closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than I had ever been before. Thereafter I was more cautious with my incantations, for I had no wish to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence I could never return. After twenty-two years of nightmare and terror, saved only by a desperate conviction of the mythical source of certain impressions, I am unwilling to vouch for the truth of that which I think I found in Western Australia on the night of July 17\u201318, 1935. There is reason to hope that my experience was wholly or partly an hallucination\u2014for which, indeed, abundant causes existed. And yet, its realism was so hideous that I sometimes find hope impossible. If the thing did happen, then man must be prepared to accept notions of the cosmos, and of his own place in the seething vortex of time, whose merest mention is paralysing. He must, too, be placed on guard against a specific lurking peril which, though it will never engulf the whole race, may impose monstrous and unguessable horrors upon certain venturesome members of it."}

It was hard to think he had no reason at all. He was very specific and logical in some ways. His story fit strangely well with some old myths, even the wildest Indian legends. It was entirely possible he heard disturbing voices in the hills. It was also possible he really found the black stone he talked about. This was true despite the crazy conclusions he had drawn. Those conclusions were probably suggested by the man who claimed to be a spy for outer beings. That man later killed himself. It was easy to think that man was completely insane. But he probably had a twisted knid of logic. This made the naive Akeley believe his story. Akeley was already prepared for such things by his folklore studies. As for the latest events, Akeley could not keep hired help. This showed his simpler country neighbors were as convinced as he was. They believed his house was surrounded by strange things at night. The dogs really did bark. Then there was the matter of the phonograph record. I could not help but believe he got it the way he said. It must mean something. It could be animal noises that sound like human speech. Or it could be the speech of some hidden, night-wandering human. This human might have decayed to a state not much better than a lower animal. From this, my thoughts returned to the black stone with hieroglyphs. I thought about what it might mean. Also, what about the photographs Akeley said he would send? The old people had found them terribly convincing. As I read the cramped handwriting again, I felt something new. I felt my trusting opponents might have more evidence than I had admitted. After all, there might be some strange, perhaps hereditarily deformed outcasts in those avoided hills. This could be true even if there was no race of star-born monsters as folklore said. If there were such outcasts, then finding strange bodies in the flooded streams would not be completely unbelievable. Was it too bold to suppose both the old legends. Recent reports had this much truth? But even as I had these doubts, I felt ashamed. Such a fantastic and bizarre thing as Henry Akeley's wild letter had raised them. In the end, I answered Akeley's letter. I used a tone of friendly interets. I asked for more details.\n###\nThe man seemed unduly excited and alarmed about something, but it was hard to think that all cause was lacking. He was so specific and logical in certain ways\u2014and after all, his yarn did fit in so perplexingly well with some of the old myths\u2014even the wildest Indian legends. That he had really overheard disturbing voices in the hills, and had really found the black stone he spoke about, was wholly possible despite the crazy inferences he had made\u2014inferences probably suggested by the man who had claimed to be a spy of the outer beings and had later killed himself. It was easy to deduce that this man must have been wholly insane, but that he probably had a streak of perverse outward logic which made the naive Akeley\u2014already prepared for such things by his folklore studies\u2014believe his tale. As for the latest developments\u2014it appeared from his inability to keep hired help that Akeley\u2019s humbler rustic neighbours were as convinced as he that his house was besieged by uncanny things at night. The dogs really barked, too. And then the matter of that phonograph record, which I could not but believe he had obtained in the way he said. It must mean something; whether animal noises deceptively like human speech, or the speech of some hidden, night-haunting human being decayed to a state not much above that of lower animals. From this my thoughts went back to the black hieroglyphed stone, and to speculations upon what it might mean. Then, too, what of the photographs which Akeley said he was about to send, and which the old people had found so convincingly terrible? As I re-read the cramped handwriting I felt as never before that my credulous opponents might have more on their side than I had conceded. After all, there might be some queer and perhaps hereditarily misshapen outcasts in those shunned hills, even though no such race of star-born monsters as folklore claimed. And if there were, then the presence of strange bodies in the flooded streams would not be wholly beyond belief. Was it too presumptuous to suppose that both the old legends and the recent reports had this much of reality behind them? But even as I harboured these doubts I felt ashamed that so fantastic a piece of bizarrerie as Henry Akeley\u2019s wild letter had brought them up. In the end I answered Akeley\u2019s letter, adopting a tone of friendly interest and soliciting further particulars."}

On the other [THING], there were many pages of symbols and formulas. There were also historical notes and philosophical comments. The handwriting was cramped. It looked exactly like the ancient script of Joseph Curwen. However, it was clearly written in modern times. Plainly had been part of a recent project. This project involved carefully copying the old wizard 's writing style. Charles seemed to have perfected this imitation to an amazing degree. There was no sign of a third [THING] 's handwriting, which might have been Aleln 's. If Allen had truly become the leader, he must have made young Ward write everything down for him. In this new material, one mystical formula appeared again and again. Actually, it was a pair of formulas. It appeared so often that Willett memorized it before he was halfway through his search. It had two side - by - side columns. The left column had the old symbol called \" Dragon 's Head \" at the top. This symbol is used in almanacs to show the ascending node. The right column had a matching symbol for \" Dragon 's Tail \". The descending node at the top. The whole thing looked something like this. Almost without thinking, the doctor realized the second half was just the first half written backward syllable by syllable. The only exceptions were the final single syllables and the strange name Yog - Sothoth. He had learned to recognize this nmae under different spellings from other things he had seen related to this horrible affair. The formluas weer as follows. They were exactly as shown, and Willett can fully confirm this. The first formula stirred a strange feeling of uncomfortable, hidden memory in his mind. He recognized this feeling later when he thought back on the events of that terrible Good Friday from the year before. These formulas were very haunting. He found them very often. Beofre the doctor knew it, he was whispering them to himself. He felt he had collected all the papers he could usefully study for now. Therefore, he decided not to examine any more until he could bring the skpetical mental health experts together for a larger, more organized search. He still needed to find the hidden laboratory. So he left his suitcase in the lit [THING]. He went back out into the black, foul - smelling hallway. The arched [THING] echoed constantly with a dull, horrible whining sound. The next few rooms he checked were all empty. Or they were only filled with rotting boxes and scary - looking lead coffins. But they made him deeply aware of the huge scale of Joseph Curwen 's original activities.\n###\nOn the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard\u2019s writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allen\u2019s there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis. In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \u201cDragon\u2019s Head\u201d and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \u201cDragon\u2019s Tail\u201d or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows\u2014exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify\u2014and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year. So haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whine. The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwen\u2019s original operations."}

I said I would meet him in Brattlebroo on the next Wednesday, September 12th, if that daate was good for him. I only disagreed with his suggestions in one way. That was abbout which train to take. Frankly, I did not want to arrive in that spooky Vermont area late at night. So, I did not take the train he picked. I called station and made a different plan. By getting up early and taking the 8:07 a.m. Train into Boston, I could get the 9:25 train to Greenfield. That wolud arrive there at 12:22 in the afternoon.

This connected exactly with a train reaching Brattleboro at 1:08 p.m.\u2014a much more comfortable hour than 10:01 for meeting Akeley and riding with him into the close-packed, secret-guarding hills."}

The barns and sheds looked. I noticed Akeley 's battreed Ford in its, shelter. the secret of the strangeness reached me. It was the silence. a farm is at from its animals. But all signs of life were missing. What about the hens and the pigs? The cows, of which Akeley had said he owned, might be in the pasture. The dogs might have been sold. But the absence of any sound of clucking or grunting was. I did not wait on the path. I entreed the house door and cloesd it behind me. It toko a effort to do. that I was shut, I had a wish to run. Not that the place looked. On the contrary, I thought the - colonial hallway was and. I admired the taste of the man who had furnished it. What mdae me want to flee was something and to define. it was a smell I thought I noticed. Though I knew how musty smells are in the farmhouses. Refusing to let these worries overcome me, I remembered Noyes 's instructions. I pushed the six - paneled, brass - latched door on my left. The room beyond was, as I had known. As I entered, I noticed the smell was. There seemed to be some, - imagined rhythm or vibration in the air. For a moment, the blinds let me see. a kind of coughing. sound drew my attention to a - chair in the, corner of the room. In its depths, I saw the blur of a man 's face and hands. In a moment, I had crossed to greet the figure who had tried to speak. Dim though the light was, I saw this was my host. I had studied the photo times. There could be no mistake about this firm, weathered face with the, grey - streaked beard.\n###\nThe door had been left ajar for me; but before approaching and entering I cast a searching glance around the whole place, trying to decide what had struck me as so intangibly queer about it. The barns and sheds looked trimly prosaic enough, and I noticed Akeley\u2019s battered Ford in its capacious, unguarded shelter. Then the secret of the queerness reached me. It was the total silence. Ordinarily a farm is at least moderately murmurous from its various kinds of livestock, but here all signs of life were missing. What of the hens and the hogs? The cows, of which Akeley had said he possessed several, might conceivably be out to pasture, and the dogs might possibly have been sold; but the absence of any trace of cackling or grunting was truly singular. I did not pause long on the path, but resolutely entered the open house door and closed it behind me. It had cost me a distinct psychological effort to do so, and now that I was shut inside I had a momentary longing for precipitate retreat. Not that the place was in the least sinister in visual suggestion; on the contrary, I thought the graceful late-colonial hallway very tasteful and wholesome, and admired the evident breeding of the man who had furnished it. What made me wish to flee was something very attenuated and indefinable. Perhaps it was a certain odd odour which I thought I noticed\u2014though I well knew how common musty odours are in even the best of ancient farmhouses. Refusing to let these cloudy qualms overmaster me, I recalled Noyes\u2019s instructions and pushed open the six-panelled, brass-latched white door on my left. The room beyond was darkened, as I had known before; and as I entered it I noticed that the queer odour was stronger there. There likewise appeared to be some faint, half-imaginary rhythm or vibration in the air. For a moment the closed blinds allowed me to see very little, but then a kind of apologetic hacking or whispering sound drew my attention to a great easy-chair in the farther, darker corner of the room. Within its shadowy depths I saw the white blur of a man\u2019s face and hands; and in a moment I had crossed to greet the figure who had tried to speak. Dim though the light was, I perceived that this was indeed my host. I had studied the kodak picture repeatedly, and there could be no mistake about this firm, weather-beaten face with the cropped, grizzled beard."}

I wondered if many of them had been as human as that first messenger he mentioned. The pressure in my [THING] became unbearable. I created all sorts of wild theories. They were about the odd, lasting smell. Those sneaky hints of vibration in the dark [THING]. Night was falling now. I remembered what Akeley had written to me about those earlier nights. I shuddered to think there would be no [THING]. Nor did I like the way the farmhouse sat sheltered near that huge, forested slope. The slope led up to the unvisited top of Dark Mountain. With Akeley 's permission, I lit a small oil lamp. I turned it low and put it on a distant bookcase. It was next to the ghostly bust of Milton. But later I was sorry I did that. It made my host 's tense, still face. Lifeless hands look terribly abnormal. Like a corpse. He seemed almost unable to move. But I saw him nod stiffly once in a while. After what he had told me, I could hardly imagine what deeper secrets he was savign for tomorrow. But finally it came out. His trip to Yuggoth and beyond was to be the next day 's topic. My own possible joining in it was also a topic. He must have been amused by my horrified reaction. I reacted when hearing space voyage proposed for me. His [THING] shook violently when I showed my fear. Subsequently he spoke very gently. He spoke of how human beings might achieve the seemingly impossible flight across the space between stars. Several times they had achieved it. It seemed complete human bodies did not actually make the trip. The great surgical, biological, chemical. Mechanical skill of the Outer Ones had found a way. They could transport human brains without their physical bodies. There was a safe way to remove a brain. There was a way to keep the [THING] alive while the brain was gone. The bare, compact brain matter was then placed in a fluid. The fluid was occasionally refilled inside an airtight cylinder. The cylinder was made of a [THING] mined in Yuggoth. Certain electrodes went through it. They connected as needed with complex instruments. These instruments could copy the three important abilities of sight, hearing, and speech. For the winged fungus - beings to carry the brain - cylinders safely through space was easy.\n###\nI wondered what beings he had talked with since his last letter to me, and whether many of them had been as human as that first emissary he had mentioned. The tension in my head grew insufferable, and I built up all sorts of wild theories about the queer, persistent odour and those insidious hints of vibration in the darkened room. Night was falling now, and as I recalled what Akeley had written me about those earlier nights I shuddered to think there would be no moon. Nor did I like the way the farmhouse nestled in the lee of that colossal forested slope leading up to Dark Mountain\u2019s unvisited crest. With Akeley\u2019s permission I lighted a small oil lamp, turned it low, and set it on a distant bookcase beside the ghostly bust of Milton; but afterward I was sorry I had done so, for it made my host\u2019s strained, immobile face and listless hands look damnably abnormal and corpse-like. He seemed half-incapable of motion, though I saw him nod stiffly once in a while. After what he had told, I could scarcely imagine what profounder secrets he was saving for the morrow; but at last it developed that his trip to Yuggoth and beyond\u2014and my own possible participation in it\u2014was to be the next day\u2019s topic. He must have been amused by the start of horror I gave at hearing a cosmic voyage on my part proposed, for his head wabbled violently when I shewed my fear. Subsequently he spoke very gently of how human beings might accomplish\u2014and several times had accomplished\u2014the seemingly impossible flight across the interstellar void. It seemed that complete human bodies did not indeed make the trip, but that the prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill of the Outer Ones had found a way to convey human brains without their concomitant physical structure. There was a harmless way to extract a brain, and a way to keep the organic residue alive during its absence. The bare, compact cerebral matter was then immersed in an occasionally replenished fluid within an ether-tight cylinder of a metal mined in Yuggoth, certain electrodes reaching through and connecting at will with elaborate instruments capable of duplicating the three vital faculties of sight, hearing, and speech. For the winged fungus-beings to carry the brain-cylinders intact through space was an easy matter."}

I felt I knew what to do with it. I took a small electric light from my pocket. It looked like a normal one. I nervously tested its flashes. The light was violet, not white. It seemed less like light and more like a stream of tiny particles. I remember I did not think it was a normal flashlight. In fact, I had a normal flashlight in a different pocket. It was becoming dark outside. The old roofs and chimneys looked very strange through the round [THING] panes. Finally I gathered my courage. I propped the small object on the [THING] against a [THING]. Then I pointed the strange violet light at it. The light now seemed more like a [THING] of small violet bits. It was not a steady beam. The particles hit the glassy center of the strange device. They made a crackling sound. It was like the sputtering of a vacuum tube with sparks. The dark glassy surface showed a pinkish light. A faint white shape seemed to be forming in its center. Then I saw I was not alone in the [THING]. I put the ray device back in my pocket. But the new [THING] did not speak. I also did not hear any sound at all for the next few moments. Everything was like a shadow plya seen from far away through a haze. Yet the new [THING] and all who came later also seemed large and close. It was as if they were both near and far. This followed some odd rule of space. The new [THING] was a thin, dark [THING] of average height. He wore the clothing of a Anglican church priest. He looked about thirty years old. His skin was a sallow olive color. His features weer fairly good. But his forehead was unusually high. His black hair was well cut and neatly brushed. He was clean - shaven, but his chin was blue from a heavy beard. He wore rimless glasses with steel frames. His [THING] and lower [THING] were like other priests I had seen. But his forehead was much higher. He was darker and looked more intelligent. He also looked more secretly and subtly evil. Right now, he had just lit a dim oil lamp. He looked nervous. Before I realized it, he was throwing all his magic books into a fireplace. The fireplace was on the [THING] side of the [THING] where the [THING] slanted sharply. I had not noticed it before.\n###\nThe small object on the table fascinated me intensely. I seemed to know what to do with it, for I drew a pocket electric light\u2014or what looked like one\u2014out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes. The light was not white but violet, and seemed less like true light than like some radio-active bombardment. I recall that I did not regard it as a common flashlight\u2014indeed, I had a common flashlight in another pocket. It was getting dark, and the ancient roofs and chimney-pots outside looked very queer through the bull\u2019s-eye window-panes. Finally I summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a book\u2014then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it. The light seemed now to be more like a rain or hail of small violet particles than like a continuous beam. As the particles struck the glassy surface at the centre of the strange device, they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed. The dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow, and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its centre. Then I noticed that I was not alone in the room\u2014and put the ray-projector back in my pocket. But the newcomer did not speak\u2014nor did I hear any sound whatever during all the immediately following moments. Everything was shadowy pantomime, as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze\u2014although on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and close, as if both near and distant, according to some abnormal geometry. The newcomer was a thin, dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the Anglican church. He was apparently about thirty years old, with a sallow, olive complexion and fairly good features, but an abnormally high forehead. His black hair was well cut and neatly brushed, and he was clean-shaven though blue-chinned with a heavy growth of beard. He wore rimless spectacles with steel bows. His build and lower facial features were like other clergymen I had seen, but he had a vastly higher forehead, and was darker and more intelligent-looking\u2014also more subtly and concealedly evil-looking. At the present moment\u2014having just lighted a faint oil lamp\u2014he looked nervous, and before I knew it he was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room (where the wall slanted sharply) which I had not noticed before."}

Faint heavelny memory might fill those children of the Great Ones. He was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his search. It would not be wise to ask too much about that clod desert stretching north of their dim land. They talked little with the other [THING] in those old [THING] taverns. Instead, they would gather in groups in remote corners. They would sing among themselves the haunting tunes of unknown places. They would chant long tales to one another in accents different from the rest of dreamland. Moving that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened.

They talked little with the other folk in those ancient sea-taverns; but would gather in groups in remote corners and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places, or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of dreamland. And so rare and moving were those airs and tales, that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened, even though the words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody. For a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of Celepha\u00efs, and before they sailed Carter had taken passage on their dark ship, telling them that he was an old onyx-miner and wishful to work in their quarries. That ship was very lovely and cunningly wrought, being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold, and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet. One morning at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lifted, and as Carter stood on the high stern he saw the sunrise-blazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless Celepha\u00efs sink into the distance, and the snowy peak of Mount Aran grow smaller and smaller. By noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the Cerenerian Sea, with one painted galley afar off bound for that cloud-hung realm of Serannian where the sea meets the sky. And night came with gorgeous stars, and the dark ship steered for Charles\u2019 Wain and the Little Bear as they swung slowly round the pole. And the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places, and then stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea. Carter went to sleep at midnight, and rose in the glow of a young morning, marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont. And all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men of the ship, getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight land, of their exquisite onyx city, and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which Leng was said to be."}

Much, in fact, that only the daily habit I was forming then explains why I kept ignoring the deeper meaning. The data in question described the quiet times of various places. These covered the same hours as when the city library had its strange feeling. head librarian, it seesm, quickly started a very wide set of measurements. She did this in nearly all rooms she could watch without intruding. She asked for hourly reports on their quietness. She also asked for the length of any notable quiet periods for some past time. The response to her request seems to have been mixed. She must have gathered more readings than any normla researcher could have organized without help. This original set of measurements was not kept. But her record books made a complete and truly important summary. Average roosm in offices and schooslgave an almost completely same result. Yet separate cases of clear but plain quiet gaps appear here and there. These always happen between late morning and early afternoon. This is the time of the library's deepest quiet. Commercial places were little more notable. But four vaguely described cases suggest fleeting feelings of unnatural stillness. One case mentions a fear of something not normal.\n###\nHere the first part of my observations concluded, but references to certain of the scattered acoustical data gave me much material for reflection\u2014so much, in fact, that only the ingrained habituation then forming my daily routine can account for my continued disregard of the deeper significance. The data in question were those descriptive of the silences of various institutions covering the same hours as that in which the municipal library had had its peculiar atmosphere. The head librarian, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of measurements amongst nearly all the chambers which she could monitor without intrusion, asking for hourly reports of their quietude, and the durations of any notable lulls for some time past. The reception of her inquiry seems to have been varied; but she must, at the very least, have accumulated more readings than any ordinary scholar could have collated without an assistant. This original instrumentation was not preserved, but her ledgers formed a thorough and really significant digest. Average rooms in offices and schools\u2014the city\u2019s traditional \u201cseats of industry\u201d\u2014gave an almost completely uniform result, though scattered instances of palpable but featureless auditory voids appear here and there, always between the late morning and the early afternoon\u2014the period of the library\u2019s profoundest hush.

Having understood a of the truths of this place. This place was hinted at by my repeating dream. We turned to that midnight cave. No light from the cliff could reach. We will know what worlds open up beyond distance we went. It was decided secrets are not for people. But there was to hold our attention. We had not gone before the searchlights showed that cursed number of pits. The rats had feasted in these pits. The stop of food had driven the rat army. they turned on the living herds of starving creatures. they burst out from the priory in that wave of destruction. The peasants will forget it. God! Those pits of cut, cleaned bones and opened skulls! Those nightmare holes were filled with the bones of ape - men,, Roman, and English. These bones were from centuries. Some pits were. No one can say how they were. Others were to our searchlights. They were filled with imaginings. I thought, what about the rats? They fell into traps during their searches in this Tartarus? my foot slipped near a edge. I flet a moment of fear. I must have been thinking a time. I could not see anyone in the group except the Capt. Norrys. a sound came from that ink -, boundless distance. I thought I recognized the sound. I saw my cat run past me like a winged god. It went into the hole of the unknown. But I was not. I had no doubt after another second. It was the rushing of those devil - born rats. They are searching for horrors. They were to lead me on. They would lead me to those smiling caves at the earth 's center. Nyarlathotep, the god with no face, howls to the music of two flute players. My searchlight died, but I ran. I heard voices, and howls, and echoes. But above all, that, sneaky rushing sound rose. It rose, rising, like a corpse rises above an river. That river flows under onyx bridges to a, sea.\n###\nOnce I saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of bones, and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyes. Having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this twilit area\u2014an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dream\u2014we turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate. We shall never know what sightless Stygian worlds yawn beyond the little distance we went, for it was decided that such secrets are not good for mankind. But there was plenty to engross us close at hand, for we had not gone far before the searchlights shewed that accursed infinity of pits in which the rats had feasted, and whose sudden lack of replenishment had driven the ravenous rodent army first to turn on the living herds of starving things, and then to burst forth from the priory in that historic orgy of devastation which the peasants will never forget. God! those carrion black pits of sawed, picked bones and opened skulls! Those nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid, Celtic, Roman, and English bones of countless unhallowed centuries! Some of them were full, and none can say how deep they had once been. Others were still bottomless to our searchlights, and peopled by unnamable fancies. What, I thought, of the hapless rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the blackness of their quests in this grisly Tartarus? Once my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink, and I had a moment of ecstatic fear. I must have been musing a long time, for I could not see any of the party but the plump Capt. Norrys. Then there came a sound from that inky, boundless, farther distance that I thought I knew; and I saw my old black cat dart past me like a winged Egyptian god, straight into the illimitable gulf of the unknown. But I was not far behind, for there was no doubt after another second. It was the eldritch scurrying of those fiend-born rats, always questing for new horrors, and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of earth\u2019s centre where Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls blindly to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players. My searchlight expired, but still I ran. I heard voices, and yowls, and echoes, but above all there gently rose that impious, insidious scurrying; gently rising, rising, as a stiff bloated corpse gently rises above an oily river that flows under endless onyx bridges to a black, putrid sea."}

Olney saw that the distant eastern windows were not open. They were closed against the hazy sky with thick, dull panes like old bottle glass. The bearded host seemed young. Yet his eyes held the depth of ancient secrets. From the wonderful old stories he told, one could guess the villagers were right. They said he had spoken with the sea mists and the sky clouds. This was ever since a village existed to see his quiet home from the plain below. The day passed slowly. Olney cnotinued to listen to tales of old times and distant lands. He heard how the Kings of Atlantis fought slipper,y unholy things. These things crawled from cracks in the ocean floor. He heard how the columned, weedy temple of Poseidonis is still seen at midnight by lost ships. Those ships know they are lost when they see it. Years of the Titans were remembered. But the host became nervous when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos. This was before the gods or even the Elder Ones were born. It was when only other gods came to dance on the peak of Hatheg-Kla. That peak is in the stony desert near Utlhar, beyond the river Skai. At that moment, a knock came on the door. It was the ancient door studded with nails, beyond which lay only a white cloud void. Olney jumped in fear. The bearded man signaled him to stay quiet. He walked softly to the door to look out through a tiny peephole. He did not like what he saw. He put a finger to his lips. Tiptoed to shut. Lock all the windows. Then he returned to the old bench beside his guest. Then Olney saw a strange black shape linger against each dim little window in turn. The caller moved around curiously outside before leaving. He was glad his host did not answer the knock. For there are strange beings in the great void. One who seeks dreams must be careful not to disturb or meet the wrong ones. Then shadows began to gather. First, shy ones under the table, then bolder ones in the dark paneled corners. The bearded man made mysterious praying gestures. He lit tall candles in oddly shaped brass candlesticks.\n###\nThe small room seemed green with a dim aqueous light, and Olney saw that the far windows to the east were not open, but shut against the misty aether with dull thick panes like the bottoms of old bottles. That bearded host seemed young, yet looked out of eyes steeped in the elder mysteries; and from the tales of marvellous ancient things he related, it must be guessed that the village folk were right in saying he had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky ever since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from the plain below. And the day wore on, and still Olney listened to rumours of old times and far places, and heard how the Kings of Atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in ocean\u2019s floor, and how the pillared and weedy temple of Poseidonis is still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships, who know by its sight that they are lost. Years of the Titans were recalled, but the host grew timid when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos before the gods or even the Elder Ones were born, and when only the other gods came to dance on the peak of Hatheg-Kla in the stony desert near Ulthar, beyond the river Skai. It was at this point that there came a knocking on the door; that ancient door of nail-studded oak beyond which lay only the abyss of white cloud. Olney started in fright, but the bearded man motioned him to be still, and tiptoed to the door to look out through a very small peep-hole. What he saw he did not like, so pressed his fingers to his lips and tiptoed around to shut and lock all the windows before returning to the ancient settle beside his guest. Then Olney saw lingering against the translucent squares of each of the little dim windows in succession a queer black outline as the caller moved inquisitively about before leaving; and he was glad his host had not answered the knocking. For there are strange objects in the great abyss, and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet the wrong ones. Then the shadows began to gather; first little furtive ones under the table, and then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners. And the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks."}

Several still remained to collect final echoes of the tragedy. I decided to choose a colleague from these. The more I thought, the more my choice leaned toward one Arthur Munroe. He was a dark, thin [THING] about thirty - five years old. His education, taste, intelligence. Temperament all seemed to mark him as someone not tied to normal ideas. On an afternoon in early September Arthur Munroe he listened to my story. I saw from the start that he was both interested and understanding. When I finished, he analyzed and discussed the thing with great cleverness and judgment. His advice was also very practical. He recommended delaying operations at the Martense mansion. We could become stronger with more detailed historical and geographical information. On his suggestion, we searched the countryside for information about the terrible Martense family. We found a [THING] who had a wonderfully clear family diary. We also talked at length with the [THING] [THING] who had not fled from the terror. Confusion to farther slopes. We arranged to do our final task last. This task was the complete and final examination of the mansion using its detailed history. Before that, we would do an equally complete. Final examination of places linked to the various tragedies in settler legends. The results of this examination were not very clear at first. But our list of them seemed to show a fairly important pattern. The number of reported horrors was greatest in areas either fairly near the avoided [THING]. Connected to it by sections of the sickly overgrown [THING]. There were, it is true, exceptions. The horror that caught the world 's attention happened in a treeless area. It was far from the mansion and from any connecting woods. About the nature. Appearance of the hiding fear, nothing could be learned from the scared.

It was from these that I determined to choose a colleague, and the more I reflected the more my preference inclined toward one Arthur Munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty-five, whose education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences. On an afternoon in early September Arthur Munroe listened to my story. I saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic, and when I had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgment. His advice, moreover, was eminently practical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the Martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data. On his initiative we combed the countryside for information regarding the terrible Martense family, and discovered a man who possessed a marvellously illuminating ancestral diary. We also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes, and arranged to precede our culminating task\u2014the exhaustive and definitive examination of the mansion in the light of its detailed history\u2014with an equally exhaustive and definitive examination of spots associated with the various tragedies of squatter legend. The results of this examination were not at first very enlightening, though our tabulation of them seemed to reveal a fairly significant trend; namely, that the number of reported horrors was by far the greatest in areas either comparatively near the avoided house or connected with it by stretches of the morbidly overnourished forest. There were, it is true, exceptions; indeed, the horror which had caught the world\u2019s ear had happened in a treeless space remote alike from the mansion and from any connecting woods. As to the nature and appearance of the lurking fear, nothing could be gained from the scared and witless shanty-dwellers. In the same breath they called it a snake and a giant, a thunder-devil and a bat, a vulture and a walking tree. We did, however, deem ourselves justified in assuming that it was a living organism highly susceptible to electrical storms; and although certain of the stories suggested wings, we believed that its aversion for open spaces made land locomotion a more probable theory."}

After giving my papers there, I went on to greet the clerk. I took the forms he had made ready for me. The testing room was just past the counter. I saw that a processing room stretched even farther in the same driection. On the laminate surface, a large group of pamphlets, applications, and permits waited for me. A verification-terminal next to pen. Tablet showed that digital checking had not been forgotten. After a boringly finished process, I got ready for the eye test. But I found the office standard had failed in this one detail. My first quick look showed a slightly disturbing color problem. So I did not look more closely. Throughout the process I thought of the clerk. He was waiting silently at the big desk in the fluorescent-lit next room. Once I went near to ask him to explain the rules. But he whispered that he could explain nothing at that moment. Later on, just before the business ended, he would offer the plastic card.

On the laminate surface a formidable array of pamphlets, applications, and permits awaited me, and a verification-terminal beside a stylus and tablet testified that digital confirmation had not been neglected. After a tediously completed ritual I prepared myself for the visual examination, but found that the administrative standard had suffered a lapse in this one particular. My initial glimpse revealed a faintly disquieting chromatic aberration, so that I did not peer more. Throughout the procedure I thought of the clerk attending mutely at the great desk in the fluorescent-lit adjacent room.

The unnamed textile maze was mostly made of clothes from 10 to 150 in dirty. Of a weight changing from five to ten pounds. It was made mostly of huge bundles of dark, ancient denim, slate-like wool. These bundles were in many cases as big as 4 by 6 by 8 feet. In several spots it seemed to be made of a solid, rough mix of very old socks. The plies were not at all equal in size. There were countless honeycomb patterns of huge size as well as smaller separate stacks. The general shape of these things was often cone-shaped, pyramid-shaped, or stepped. But there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes, groups of cubes, and other rectangle shapes.

It was fully three hours into its daily quiet. But it was still very strong in its emptiness and silence. From this view one could guess many things about being alone. Mainly, it is indeed only a temporary empty space. It rules weakly over this concrete area and has no lasting powre elsewhere. It might, the watcher thought, give a moment's peace if conditions were good. One must not think of entering the deep quiet that covers the lot in the sun's glare. It was lucky no person stayed where the heat waves shimmer. The results of disutrbing it would be very bad. The lot's earlier visitor, a deliveryman named Higgins, had been made to mutter in distraction. This happened just from meeting a stray shopping cart in Row G. With the true center of the silence, if ever broken, things would be much worse. The quiet may sometimes be broken by a careless intruder.

From this scene one might deduce many things about solitude, but mainly that it is indeed only a temporary void, reigning feebly over this concrete realm and having no permanence or dominion elsewhere. It might, the observer mused, grant a moment\u2019s peace if conditions were favourable; but one must not think of penetrating the profound stillness that cloaks the lot in the solar glare. It was fortunate that no soul lingered where the heat waves shimmer, for the consequences of disturbing it would be very dire. The lot\u2019s prior visitor, a deliveryman named Higgins, had been driven to muttering distraction by encountering merely a stray shopping cart in Row G. With the true core of the silence, if ever breached, matters would be much worse; for although the quiet may sometimes be dispelled by a careless interloper, it is guarded by the Deeper Stills from Beyond, whom it is better not to invoke. At least twice in the lot\u2019s recent history the Deeper Stills imposed their hush upon the oil-stained pavement; once during a power outage, as inferred from a notation in those ledgers of the maintenance office too cryptic to be deciphered, and once near the lamp-post when Higgins the Hurried tried to hear the faint hum of the transformers at midday. So, the observer concluded, it would be much better to let all silences persist except in cautious and fleeting incursions."}

This naturally involved the overgrown paths to the green inner yard. We had not known their layout before. Now we had to look at. From the clear spread of the plants, we figured out that a gently sloping lawn of about an acre past the nearby fences would bring us to the edge of the dizzy, sunlit thickets above the hedge. Past that boundary, winding trails kept by the owners led to the stony edge of the hidden, shaded brook. To see this everyday view in plain reality was a strong plul. It seemed impossible to resist once we knew about the chance. We knew we must start the inspection right away if we wanted to finish it before the afternoon faded.\n###\nI have said that our scrutiny of the neglected garden brought about a change in our immediate observation. This of course had to do with the overgrown pathways to the verdant inner yard, of whose arrangement we had not been cognizant before, but which we were now compelled to examine and comprehend.

This happened since the tom - tom began its beating. It beat within the woods. No dweller ventured. There were shouts and screams. There were soul - chilling chants and dancing devil - flames. The messenger added the people could stand it. a body of twenty police set out in the afternoon. They filled two carriages and an automobile. The shivering squatter acted as a guide. At the end of the road they got out. For miles they splashed on in silence. They went through the cypress woods. Day came. roots and hanging nooses of moss beset them. a pile of stones. A fragment of a rotting wall intensified the depression. Its hint of habitation did this. Every tree and every islet combined to create the depression. At length the squatter settlement came in sight. It was a huddle of huts. dwellers ran out. They clustered around the group of bobbing lanterns. The beat of tom - toms was,.

There were legends of a lake. No sight had glimpsed it. A, thing with eyes dwelt in it. Squatters wihspered that bat - winged devils flew up. They came out of caverns in earth to worship it at midnight. They said it had been before D'Iberville. It was before La Salle. It was before the Indians. It was before the beasts and birds of the woods. It was itself. To see it was to die.\n###\nThe squatters there, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of Lafitte\u2019s men, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night. It was voodoo, apparently, but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent tom-tom had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured. There were insane shouts and harrowing screams, soul-chilling chants and dancing devil-flames; and, the frightened messenger added, the people could stand it no more. So a body of twenty police, filling two carriages and an automobile, had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide. At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before. The region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute, substantially unknown and untraversed by white men. There were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight, in which dwelt a huge, formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes; and squatters whispered that bat-winged devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight. They said it had been there before D\u2019Iberville, before La Salle, before the Indians, and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods. It was nightmare itself, and to see it was to die."}

It killed fourteen people. Three bodies were in damaged homes and were not alive. On the third night, desperate search groups, led by police, caught it in a building on Crane Street near the Miskatonic campus. They organized the search carefully. They stayed in contact using volunteer telephone stations. When someone in the college area reported hearing scratching at a closed window, they quickly set a trap. Because of general warnings and safety steps, there were only two more victims. The capture happened without major injuries. The thing was finally stopped by a bullet, though not a deadly one. It was taken quickly to the local hospital. Everyone was excited and disgusted. For it had been a man. This was clear despite the sickening eyes, the silent ape-like appearance, and the devilish violence. They treated its wound and took it to the asylum at Sefton. There it hit its heda against the walls of a padded room for sixteen years. This lasted until the recent accident, when it escaped under conditions few like to discuss. What most disgusted the seacrhers of Akrham was what they saw when the monster's face was cleaned. There was a mocking, unbelievable likeness to a learend. Selfless martyr buried only three days earlier. This was the late Dr. Allan Halsey, a public helper and dean of the medical school of Miskatonic University. It is unusual to fire all six shots from a revolver very suddenly when one would likely be enough. But many thinsg in the life of Herbert West were unusual. For example, it is not common for a doctor leaving college to hide the reasons for choosing a home. Yet that was true for Hebrert West. I got our degrees at the medical school of Miskatonic University, we wanted to help our poverty by starting as general doctors. We were very careful not to say we chose our huose because it was quite isolated. We also did not say it was as close as possible to the potter's field. Behavior like this rarely has no cause. Indeed, ours had a cause. Our needs came from a life's work that was very unpopular.\n###\nIt had not left behind quite all that it had attacked, for sometimes it had been hungry. The number it had killed was fourteen; three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive. On the third night frantic bands of searchers, led by the police, captured it in a house on Crane Street near the Miskatonic campus. They had organised the quest with care, keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations, and when someone in the college district had reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered window, the net was quickly spread. On account of the general alarm and precautions, there were only two more victims, and the capture was effected without major casualties. The thing was finally stopped by a bullet, though not a fatal one, and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and loathing. For it had been a man. This much was clear despite the nauseous eyes, the voiceless simianism, and the daemoniac savagery. They dressed its wound and carted it to the asylum at Sefton, where it beat its head against the walls of a padded cell for sixteen years\u2014until the recent mishap, when it escaped under circumstances that few like to mention. What had most disgusted the searchers of Arkham was the thing they noticed when the monster\u2019s face was cleaned\u2014the mocking, unbelievable resemblance to a learned and self-sacrificing martyr who had been entombed but three days before\u2014the late Dr. Allan Halsey, public benefactor and dean of the medical school of Miskatonic University. It is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one would probably be sufficient, but many things in the life of Herbert West were uncommon. It is, for instance, not often that a young physician leaving college is obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office, yet that was the case with Herbert West. When he and I obtained our degrees at the medical school of Miskatonic University, and sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners, we took great care not to say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated, and as near as possible to the potter\u2019s field. Reticence such as this is seldom without a cause, nor indeed was ours; for our requirements were those resulting from a life-work distinctly unpopular."}

I had studied the kodak picture repeatedly, and there could be no mistake about this firm, weather-beaten face with the cropped, grizzled beard. But as I looked again my recognition was mixed with sadness and anxiety; for certainly, this face was that of a very sick man. I felt that there must be something more than asthma behind that strained, rigid, immobile expression and unwinking glassy stare; and realised how terribly the strain of his frightful experiences must have told on him. Was it not enough to break any human being\u2014even a younger man than this intrepid delver into the forbidden? The strange and sudden relief, I feared, had come too late to save him from something like a general breakdown. There was a touch of the pitiful in the limp, lifeless way his lean hands rested in his lap. He had on a loose dressing-gown, and was swathed around the head and high around the neck with a vivid yellow scarf or hood. And then I saw that he was trying to talk in the same hacking whisper with which he had greeted me. It was a hard whisper to catch at first, since the grey moustache concealed all movements of the lips, and something in its timbre disturbed me greatly; but by concentrating my attention I could soon make out its purport surprisingly well. The accent was by no means a rustic one, and the language was even more polished than correspondence had led me to expect. \u201cMr. Wilmarth, I presume? You must pardon my not rising.

Reaching me on that Tuesday morning, October twelfth, came that odldy ordinray. Strong habit of getting the daily mial. Taht simple act of routine. Hope must have shown such a huge change in the whole daily play of the suburbna street. Again I will describe from memory. I am trying for special reasons to keep as much of the feel of the experience as I can. It was a trip of maybe two hundred yards. The mailbox as well as the mail inside it was normal. This is common with such everyday tasks. The walk, though, was wonderfully drawn out for such a distance. I decided the path must have changed in some slight way. Perhaps from the recent rains. To say the trip tired me would be only fair. Yet under my tiredness was a layer of unease. If the morning had been normal in its start, was it now normal in its end? And the sort of \"changed view\" gained... What did it mean? The whole walk suggested such a complete opposite of my usual lack of attention!

They will ask themselves how I could have believed anything else after seeing the proof of that horror. That horror is the thing on the doorstep. Before that, I also saw only madness in the wild stories I have followed. Even now I ask myself if I was wrong. Or I ask if I am not mad after all. I do not know. But others have strange things to tell about Edward and Asenath Derby. Even the calm police are confused about that last terrible visit. They have tried weakly to create a theory of a terrible joke. Warning by fired servants. They know in their hearts that the truth is something much more terrible. Hard to believe. So I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby.

There are dark areas of shadow close to our daily paths. Now and then some evil soul breaks a way through. When that happens, the [THING] who knows must act before thinking about the results. I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years younger than me, he was. Advanced that we had much in common from the time he was eight. I was sixteen. He was the most amazing [THING] student I have ever known. At seve,n he was writing poetry of a dark, strange, almost unhealthy style. This surprised the teachers around him. Perhaps his private education and sheltered life had something to do with his early development. An only [THING], he had physical weaknesses. These weaknesses worried his loving parents and made them keep him very close to them. He was never allowed out without his nurse. He rarely had a chance to play freely with other children. All this likely encouraged a strange, secret inner life in the boy. Imagination was his one path to freedom. In any case, his childhood learning was huge and odd. His easy writings captivated me even though I was older. About that time, I had interests in art of a somewhat strange style. I found in this younger [THIN]G a rare like - minded spirit. What was behind our shared love of shadows. Wonders was, no doubt, the ancient, decaying. Slightly scary [THING] where we lived. It was a [THING] cursed by witches and full of legends. It was Arkham. Its crowded, sloping gambrel roofs. Crumbling Georgian railings have watched over the centuries beside the darkly whispering Miskatonic.\n###\nLater some of my readers will weigh each statement, correlate it with the known facts, and ask themselves how I could have believed otherwise than as I did after facing the evidence of that horror\u2014that thing on the doorstep. Until then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have acted on. Even now I ask myself whether I was misled\u2014or whether I am not mad after all. I do not know\u2014but others have strange things to tell of Edward and Asenath Derby, and even the stolid police are at their wits\u2019 ends to account for that last terrible visit.

There are black zones of shadow close to our daily paths, and now and then some evil soul breaks a passage through. When that happens, the man who knows must strike before reckoning the consequences. I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years my junior, he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and I sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic, almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All this doubtless fostered a strange, secretive inner life in the boy, with imagination as his one avenue of freedom. At any rate, his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his facile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age. About that time I had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast, and I found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit. What lay behind our joint love of shadows and marvels was, no doubt, the ancient, mouldering, and subtly fearsome town in which we lived\u2014witch-cursed, legend-haunted Arkham, whose huddled, sagging gambrel roofs and crumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the darkly muttering Miskatonic."}

Around 3:30 p.m., a heavy weight fell, disturbing everyone in the house. Knocking over three of the wicker baskets. The room was dark, and the hlalway still shone with that pale afternoon light.

And yet as many as three persons\u2014all relatives\u2014seemed to sense something ominous in the atmosphere. Grandmother explained to Cousin Althea that this was a dread inherited from ancestral lore\u2014the elders having woven a curious fabric of baleful superstition about the heavy baskets which at regular intervals accumulate within the closets under a tidy house. Such burdens, it is whispered, swell from the great woven receptacles under the stairs where terrible washings have occurred\u2014and are never hefted except near chambers where the many soiled garments are gathered. Close to four the weight intensified as suddenly as it had begun, leaving the laundry piles in new and unfamiliar forms."}

This made the search very difficult. Naphthali Field's grave seemed as hard to find as Curwen's grave. However, there was no organized effort to erase tihs grave. So, one could reasonably hope to find the stone itself. This could happen even if the written record was lost. Therefore, they took many walks. Thye excluded St. John's Churchyard and the old Congregational burying-ground in the middle of Swan Point Cemetery. Other records showed that the only Naphthali Field whose grave could be the target was a Baptist. It was near May when Dr. Willett spoke with the young man. He did this at the request of the senior Ward. He was also armed with all the Curwen information the family had collected. They got this from Charles during his more open period. The conversation was not very useful or decisive. Willett felt constantly that Charles was completely in control. He was also focuesd on mattres of real importance. It at least made the secretive young man give some logical reason for his recent behavior. Ward had a pale, calm face that did not easily show embarrassment. He seemed quite willing to talk about his acitvities. However, he would not reveal their goal. He said his ancestor's papers contained some remarkable secrets. These were secrets of early scientific knowledge. Most were in code. Their apparent range was only comparable to the discoveries of Friar Bacon. They might even surpass those discoveries. However, they were meaningless unless connected to a body of knowledge. That knowledge is now completely out of date. Presenting them immediately to a world with only modern science would strip them of all impact. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought, they must first be connected by someone. That person msut know the background from which they came. Ward was now dedicating himself to this task of connection. He was trying to learn as fast as possible those neglected old skills. A true interpreter of the Curwen data must have these skills. He hoped in time to make a full announcement. He believed it would be of the greatest interest to humanity. The world of thought. He declared that not even Einstein could more deeply change the current understanding of things. Regarding his graveyard search, he freely admitted its purpose. But he did not share the details of its progress. He said he had reason to think that Joesph Curwen's damaged headstone had certain mystic symbols. These were carved based on directions in his will. The people who erased the name ignorantly left them untouched. These symbols were absolutely necessary for the final solution of his cryptic system.\n###\nThe lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Field\u2019s grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles\u2014from which St. John\u2019s (the former King\u2019s) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist. It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things. As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwen\u2019s mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols\u2014carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name\u2014which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system."}

They will think this because we thought about the north tunnel. after our discovery. I am not to say we would have thought those thoughts. But a event happened to us. It started a line of thinking. We had put the tarp over Gedney. We were standing in confusion. the sounds reached our awareness. They were the sounds we heard since going down from the air., the mountain wind whined from its heights. The sounds were and. Their presence in this world of death was. than any. sounds could have been. This was because they upset all our ideas of order. If it had been some trace of that piping over a range, we would have expected it. Lake 's dissection report led us to expect it from those others., our overexcited imaginations had been hearing it in every wind howl since finding the camp horror. That would have fit with the region around us. A voice from ages belongs in a graveyard of ages., the noise shattered all our - set adjustments. It shattered our acceptance of the Antarctic as a waste. We thought it was. of any life as the face of the moon. What we heard was not the sound of any buried evil of earth. The sun had not drawn a answer from its toughness., it was a thing. Our days at sea off Victoria Land. Our camp days at McMurdo Sound had made it. We shuddered to think of it, where things should not be. To be, it was the squawking of a penguin. The sound came from under - ice spaces opposite the hall we came from. These areas were toward that tunnel to the abyss. A living water - bidr in suhc a direction, in a world whose surface was., cuold lead to one conclusion. our thought was to check if the sound was.\n###\nThey were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog. Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our sombre discovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations. We had replaced the tarpaulin over poor Gedney and were standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our consciousness\u2014the first sounds we had heard since descending out of the open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights. Well known and mundane though they were, their presence in this remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have been\u2014since they gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmony. Had it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which Lake\u2019s dissection report had led us to expect in those others\u2014and which, indeed, our overwrought fancies had been reading into every wind-howl we had heard since coming on the camp horror\u2014it would have had a kind of hellish congruity with the aeon-dead region around us. A voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other epochs. As it was, however, the noise shattered all our profoundly seated adjustments\u2014all our tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste as utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life as the sterile disc of the moon. What we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose supernal toughness an age-denied polar sun had evoked a monstrous response. Instead, it was a thing so mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarised by our sea days off Victoria Land and our camp days at McMurdo Sound that we shuddered to think of it here, where such things ought not to be. To be brief\u2014it was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin. The muffled sound floated from sub-glacial recesses nearly opposite to the corridor whence we had come\u2014regions manifestly in the direction of that other tunnel to the vast abyss. The presence of a living water-bird in such a direction\u2014in a world whose surface was one of age-long and uniform lifelessness\u2014could lead to only one conclusion; hence our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound."}

By this time the tree by the tomb had attained amazing proportions, exceeding all other trees of its kind, and sending out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which Musides laboured. As many visitors came to view the prodigious tree, as to admire the art of the sculptor, so that Musides was seldom alone. But he did not mind his multitude of guests; indeed, he seemed to dread being alone now that his absorbing work was done. The bleak mountain wind, sighing through the olive grove and the tomb-tree, had an uncanny way of forming vaguely articulate sounds."}

Still dazed, he clutched at the spiky thing and staggered downstairs to Landlord Dombrowski\u2019s quarters. The whining prayers of the superstitious loomfixer were still sounding through the mouldy halls, but Gilman did not mind them now. The landlord was in, and greeted him pleasantly. No, he had not seen that thing before and did not know anything about it. But his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon, and maybe that was it. Dombrowski called her, and she waddled in. Yes, that was the thing. She had found it in the young gentleman\u2019s bed\u2014on the side next the wall. It had looked very queer to her, but of course the young gentleman had lots of queer things in his room\u2014books and curios and pictures and markings on paper. She certainly knew nothing about it. So Gilman climbed upstairs again in a mental turmoil, convinced that he was either still dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to incredible extremes and led him to depredations in unknown places. Where had he got this outr\u00e9 thing? He did not recall seeing it in any museum in Arkham. It must have been somewhere, though; and the sight of it as he snatched it in his sleep must have caused the odd dream-picture of the balustraded terrace. Next day he would make some very guarded inquiries\u2014and perhaps see the nerve specialist. Meanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism. As he went upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had borrowed\u2014with a frank admission as to its purpose\u2014from the landlord. He had stopped at Elwood\u2019s door on the way, but had found all dark within. Entering his room, he placed the spiky thing on the table, and lay down in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing to undress. From the closed loft above the slanting ceiling he thought he heard a faint scratching and padding, but he was too disorganised even to mind it. That cryptical pull from the north was getting very strong again, though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the sky. In the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged, furry thing came again and with a greater distinctness than on any former occasion."}

Here long ago a brighter picture dwelt, with clear-eyed mariners on the lower streets and homes of taste and substance where the larger houses line the hill. One can trace the relics of this former happiness in the trim shapes of the buildings, the occasional graceful churches, and the evidences of original art and background in bits of detail here and there\u2014a worn flight of steps, a battered doorway, a wormy pair of decorative columns or pilasters, or a fragment of once green space with bent and rusted iron railing. The houses are generally in solid blocks, and now and then a many-windowed cupola arises to tell of days when the households of captains and ship-owners watched the sea. From this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the blasphemies of an hundred dialects assail the sky. Hordes of prowlers reel shouting and singing along the lanes and thoroughfares, occasional furtive hands suddenly extinguish lights and pull down curtains, and swarthy, sin-pitted faces disappear from windows when visitors pick their way through. Policemen despair of order or reform, and seek rather to erect barriers protecting the outside world from the contagion. The clang of the patrol is answered by a kind of spectral silence, and such prisoners as are taken are never communicative. Visible offences are as varied as the local dialects, and run the gamut from the smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens through diverse stages of lawlessness and obscure vice to murder and mutilation in their most abhorrent guises. That these visible affairs are not more frequent is not to the neighbourhood\u2019s credit, unless the power of concealment be an art demanding credit. More people enter Red Hook than leave it\u2014or at least, than leave it by the landward side\u2014and those who are not loquacious are the likeliest to leave. Malone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more terrible than any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by priests and philanthropists. He was conscious, as one who united imagination with scientific knowledge, that modern people under lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of primitive half-ape savagery in their daily life and ritual observances; and he had often viewed with an anthropologist\u2019s shudder the chanting, cursing processions of blear-eyed and pockmarked young men which wound their way along in the dark small hours of morning."}

To a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger; a danger widespread and all-embracing, such a danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night.

A sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land, and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places. There was a daemoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons\u2014the autumn heat lingered fearsomely, and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of gods or forces which were unknown. And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilisation came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger.

Unclassified changes of life force. These exist very rarely in three - dimensional space because of a closer link with other space units. They are near enough to the edge of our own to give us occasional signs. We, lacking a proper position, may never hope to understand these signs. In short, it seemed to my uncle.

It was still working through rare and unknown laws of atomic and electronic movement. The recorded history of the Roulet family seemed to prove they had an unusual connection to outer circles of being. These are dark areas that for normal [THING] hold only disgust and fear.

Did these patterns weakly survive the bodies killed and buried by the crowd? Did they continue to work in some multiple - dimensioned space along the original lines of force set by a mad hatred of the growing community? Such a thing was surely not a physical. Biochemical impossibility in light of a newer science. This science includes the theories of relativity and action within atoms. One could easily imagine an alien core of matter or energy. It might be formless or not. It is kept alive by unseen. Non - material takings from the life force. Fluids of other, more clearly living things. It enters these things and sometimes joins completely with their structure. It might be actively hostile. Or it might be driven only by blind motives of self - survival. In any case, such a monster must in our system be a strange thing. Destroying it is a main duty for every [THING] not an enemy to the world 's life, health. What confused us was our complete lack of knowledge of the form we might meet the thing in. No sane [THING] had ever seen it. Few had ever clearly felt it. It might be pure energy \u2014 a form airy and outside the world of matter. Or it might be partly material. It could be some unknown and unclear mass able to change shape. It might change at will to vague likenesses of solid, liquid, gas. Thinly unparticled states.\n###\nRather must it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility of certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and attenuated matter; existing very infrequently in three-dimensional space because of its more intimate connexion with other spatial units, yet close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasional manifestations which we, for lack of a proper vantage-point, may never hope to understand. In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house; traceable to one or another of the ill-favoured French settlers of two centuries before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of atomic and electronic motion. That the family of Roulet had possessed an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity\u2014dark spheres which for normal folk hold only repulsion and terror\u2014their recorded history seemed to prove. Had not, then, the riots of those bygone seventeen-thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid brain of one or more of them\u2014notably the sinister Paul Roulet\u2014which obscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob, and continued to function in some multiple-dimensioned space along the original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the encroaching community? Such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity and intra-atomic action. One might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the life-force or bodily tissues and fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself. It might be actively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of self-preservation. In any case such a monster must of necessity be in our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose extirpation forms a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the world\u2019s life, health, and sanity. What baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might encounter the thing. No sane person had even seen it, and few had ever felt it definitely. It might be pure energy\u2014a form ethereal and outside the realm of substance\u2014or it might be partly material; some unknown and equivocal mass of plasticity, capable of changing at will to nebulous approximations of the solid, liquid, gaseous, or tenuously unparticled states."}

The grocery boy had prepared me for it, yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed. Puerile though the story was, old Zadok\u2019s insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow. Later I might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of historic allegory; just now I wished to put it out of my head. The hour had grown perilously late\u2014my watch said 7:15, and the Arkham bus left Town Square at eight\u2014so I tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible, meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where I had checked my valise and would find my bus. Though the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient roofs and decrepit chimneys an air of mystic loveliness and peace, I could not help glancing over my shoulder now and then. I would surely be very glad to get out of malodorous and fear-shadowed Innsmouth, and wished there were some other vehicle than the bus driven by that sinister-looking fellow Sargent. Yet I did not hurry too precipitately, for there were architectural details worth viewing at every silent corner; and I could easily, I calculated, cover the necessary distance in a half-hour. Studying the grocery youth\u2019s map and seeking a route I had not traversed before, I chose Marsh Street instead of State for my approach to Town Square. Near the corner of Fall Street I began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers, and when I finally reached the Square I saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the Gilman House. It seemed as if many bulging, watery, unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as I claimed my valise in the lobby, and I hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellow-passengers on the coach. The bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight, and an evil-looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver. Sargent threw out a mail-bag and a roll of newspapers, and entered the hotel; while the passengers\u2014the same men whom I had seen arriving in Newburyport that morning\u2014shambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint guttural words with a loafer in a language I could have sworn was not English."}

Springing out of bed, I poked at the arras with the long handle of a warming-pan that rested near, and lifted one section to see what lay beneath. There was nothing but the patched stone wall, and even the cat had lost his tense realisation of abnormal presences. When I examined the circular trap that had been placed in the room, I found all of the openings sprung, though no trace remained of what had been caught and had escaped. Further sleep was out of the question, so, lighting a candle, I opened the door and went out in the gallery toward the stairs to my study, Nigger-Man following at my heels. Before we had reached the stone steps, however, the cat darted ahead of me and vanished down the ancient flight. As I descended the stairs myself, I became suddenly aware of sounds in the great room below; sounds of a nature which could not be mistaken. The oak-panelled walls were alive with rats, scampering and milling, whilst Nigger-Man was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter. Reaching the bottom, I switched on the light, which did not this time cause the noise to subside. The rats continued their riot, stampeding with such force and distinctness that I could finally assign to their motions a definite direction. These creatures, in numbers apparently inexhaustible, were engaged in one stupendous migration from inconceivable heights to some depth conceivably, or inconceivably, below. I now heard steps in the corridor, and in another moment two servants pushed open the massive door. They were searching the house for some unknown source of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a snarling panic and caused them to plunge precipitately down several flights of stairs and squat, yowling, before the closed door to the sub-cellar. I asked them if they had heard the rats, but they replied in the negative. And when I turned to call their attention to the sounds in the panels, I realised that the noise had ceased. With the two men, I went down to the door of the sub-cellar, but found the cats already dispersed. Later I resolved to explore the crypt below, but for the present I merely made a round of the traps. All were sprung, yet all were tenantless. Satisfying myself that no one had heard the rats save the felines and me, I sat in my study till morning; thinking profoundly, and recalling every scrap of legend I had unearthed concerning the building I inhabited."}

They chilled and fascinated him than he dared tell his police associates. He seemed to see in them some thread of connection. He saw some, hidden. pattern. Below the mass of facts. by the police. He felt inside that they must be the heirs of some and tradition. They were sharers of and pieces from cults and ceremonies than mankind. Their unity and clearness suggested it. It showed in the hint of order hiding under their disorder. He had not read books like Miss Mruray 's Witch - Cult in Western Europe for nothing. He knew that until years a. system of meetings.

He lived in the but kept mansion his grandfather built in Flatbush. That was when the village was than a gruop of cottages around the steepled, ivy - covered Reformed Church with its iron - railed yard of gravestones.\n###\nMalone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more terrible than any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by priests and philanthropists. He was conscious, as one who united imagination with scientific knowledge, that modern people under lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of primitive half-ape savagery in their daily life and ritual observances; and he had often viewed with an anthropologist\u2019s shudder the chanting, cursing processions of blear-eyed and pockmarked young men which wound their way along in the dark small hours of morning. One saw groups of these youths incessantly; sometimes in leering vigils on street corners, sometimes in doorways playing eerily on cheap instruments of music, sometimes in stupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around cafeteria tables near Borough Hall, and sometimes in whispering converse around dingy taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops of crumbling and closely shuttered old houses. They chilled and fascinated him more than he dared confess to his associates on the force, for he seemed to see in them some monstrous thread of secret continuity; some fiendish, cryptical, and ancient pattern utterly beyond and below the sordid mass of facts and habits and haunts listed with such conscientious technical care by the police. They must be, he felt inwardly, the heirs of some shocking and primordial tradition; the sharers of debased and broken scraps from cults and ceremonies older than mankind. Their coherence and definiteness suggested it, and it shewed in the singular suspicion of order which lurked beneath their squalid disorder. He had not read in vain such treatises as Miss Murray\u2019s Witch-Cult in Western Europe; and knew that up to recent years there had certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a frightful and clandestine system of assemblies and orgies descended from dark religions antedating the Aryan world, and appearing in popular legends as Black Masses and Witches\u2019 Sabbaths. That these hellish vestiges of old Turanian-Asiatic magic and fertility-cults were even now wholly dead he could not for a moment suppose, and he frequently wondered how much older and how much blacker than the very worst of the muttered tales some of them might really be. It was the case of Robert Suydam which took Malone to the heart of things in Red Hook. Suydam was a lettered recluse of ancient Dutch family, possessed originally of barely independent means, and inhabiting the spacious but ill-preserved mansion which his grandfather had built in Flatbush when that village was little more than a pleasant group of colonial cottages surrounding the steepled and ivy-clad Reformed Church with its iron-railed yard of Netherlandish gravestones."}

He would fall into a cow -, - state like that of the hill people. As Slater he grew, it appeared, his morning behaviors had increased in how they happened. How they were. a month before his arrival at the hospital occurred the tragedy which caused his arrest by authorities. One day near noon, after a sleep started in a whiskey drinking party at five the afternoon, the man had woken himself. He made howls. that they brought neighbors to his cabin \u2014 a pigsty where he lived with a family to describe as himself. Rushing out into the snow, he had thrown his arms up.

Not that his form of language was at all unusual, for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment; but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness, that none might listen without apprehension. He himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors, and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said, or at least all that had caused him to say what he did; relapsing into a bovine, half-amiable normality like that of the other hill-dwellers. As Slater grew older, it appeared, his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence; till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities. One day near noon, after a profound sleep begun in a whiskey debauch at about five of the previous afternoon, the man had roused himself most suddenly; with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought several neighbours to his cabin\u2014a filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as indescribable as himself. Rushing out into the snow, he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air; the while shouting his determination to reach some \u2018big, big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor, and the loud queer music far away\u2019. As two men of moderate size sought to restrain him, he had struggled with maniacal force and fury, screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain \u2018thing that shines and shakes and laughs\u2019. At length, after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow, he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness, shrieking fiendishly that he would \u2018jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him\u2019. Family and neighbours had now fled in a panic, and when the more courageous of them returned, Slater was gone, leaving behind an unrecognisable pulp-like thing that had been a living man but an hour before."}

But for, all my attention was caught by the view below me. I realized I had come face to face with rumor - darkened Innsmouth. It was a town of area and building. Yet it had a lack of life. From the mess of chimney pots, no smoke came. The trhee steeples stood out, and, against the horizon toward the sea. One of them was crumbling at the top.

Actually, it was caused by the unwise cutting of woodlands near the shore, which robbed the soil of its best protection and opened the way for waves of wind-blown sand. At last we lost sight of Plum Island and saw the vast expanse of the open Atlantic on our left. Our narrow course began to climb steeply, and I felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted roadway met the sky. It was as if the bus were about to keep on in its ascent, leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky. The smell of the sea took on ominous implications, and the silent driver\u2019s bent, rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful. As I looked at him I saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face, having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a grey scabrous surface. Then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond, where the Manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in Kingsport Head and veer off toward Cape Ann. On the far, misty horizon I could just make out the dizzy profile of the Head, topped by the queer ancient house of which so many legends are told; but for the moment all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me. I had, I realised, come face to face with rumour-shadowed Innsmouth. It was a town of wide extent and dense construction, yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life. From the tangle of chimney-pots scarcely a wisp of smoke came, and the three tall steeples loomed stark and unpainted against the seaward horizon. One of them was crumbling down at the top, and in that and another there were only black gaping holes where clock-dials should have been. The vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay, and as we approached along the now descending road I could see that many roofs had wholly caved in. There were some large square Georgian houses, too, with hipped roofs, cupolas, and railed \u201cwidow\u2019s walks\u201d."}

This time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs. I knew the prowler had realized my doors were bolted. He was giving up his attempt for a. time, as the future would show.

From the start, I felt the person trying the locks meant a danger. It was not a danger to face. to run from as. The one thing to do was to get out of that hotel as I could. I had to use some way than the stairs and lobby. Getting up. Shining my flashlight on the switch, I tried to turn on the bulb over my bed. I wanted to choose.

As I stood thinking with my hand on the switch, I heard a muffled creaking on the floor. I thought I could make out voices talking. A moment, I was the sounds were voices.

This time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realised the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or lesser time, as the future would shew. The readiness with which I fell into a plan of action proves that I must have been subconsciously fearing some menace and considering possible avenues of escape for hours. From the first I felt that the unseen fumbler meant a danger not to be met or dealt with, but only to be fled from as precipitately as possible. The one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as I could, and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby. Rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch, I sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift, valiseless flight. Nothing, however, happened; and I saw that the power had been cut off. Clearly, some cryptic, evil movement was afoot on a large scale\u2014just what, I could not say. As I stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch I heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought I could barely distinguish voices in conversation. A moment later I felt less sure that the deeper sounds were voices, since the apparent hoarse barkings and loose-syllabled croakings bore so little resemblance to recognised human speech. Then I thought with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential building. Having filled my pockets with the flashlight\u2019s aid, I put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent. Despite the state\u2019s safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel, and I saw that my windows commanded only a sheer three-story drop to the cobbled courtyard. On the right and left, however, some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel; their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourth-story level. To reach either of these lines of buildings I would have to be in a room two doors from my own\u2014in one case on the north and in the other case on the south\u2014and my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances I had of making the transfer."}

They told him of sounds heard in the night. When he heard these things, his crying changed to thought. it changed to prayer. He stretched his arms toward the sun. He prayed in a language no villager could understand. The villagers did not try to understand. Their attention was taken by the sky. The shapes the clouds were taking. It was. As the boy said his prayer, shadowy, shapes seemed to form. They were shapes of things. They were creatures with crowns of discs flanked by horns. Nature is of illusions to impress people. That night the wanderers left Ulthar. They were seen. The homeowners were. They noticed that in the village not one cat could be found. The cat had vanished from each home. Cats and,, grey, striped,, and were gone. Old Kranon, the mayor, swore the folk had taken the cats for revenge. It was revenge for killing Menes ' kitten. He cursed the caravan and the bo.y But Nith, the clerk, said the farmer and his wife were suspects. Their hatred of cats was and growing bolder.\n###\nThere was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother, but only a tiny black kitten to cherish. The plague had not been kind to him, yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow; and when one is very young, one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten. So the boy whom the dark people called Menes smiled more often than he wept as he sate playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon. On the third morning of the wanderers\u2019 stay in Ulthar, Menes could not find his kitten; and as he sobbed aloud in the market-place certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife, and of sounds heard in the night. And when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation, and finally to prayer. He stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand; though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand, since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming. It was very peculiar, but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy, nebulous figures of exotic things; of hybrid creatures crowned with horn-flanked discs. Nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginative. That night the wanderers left Ulthar, and were never seen again. And the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found. From each hearth the familiar cat had vanished; cats large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow, and white. Old Kranon, the burgomaster, swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of Menes\u2019 kitten; and cursed the caravan and the little boy. But Nith, the lean notary, declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold. Still, no one durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little Atal, the innkeeper\u2019s son, vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of Ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees, pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage, two abreast, as if in performance of some unheard-of rite of beasts."}

And these were all that the people I knew believed. the notebooks of my uncle, Dr. Elihu Whipple, revealed to me in detail the darker, vaguer guesses.

This was to the impossibility of renting it. These people were not all cut off by one cause., it seemed their vitality was drained. each one died from whatever weakness they may have had. Those who did not die showed, to varying degrees, a type of anemia. they showed a decline in ability. This spoke for the healthiness of the building.

A nameless air of desolation hung around the panelling, shutters, peeling wallpaper, falling plaster, rickety staircases. pieces of battered furniture as remained.\n###\nIt was plainly unhealthy, perhaps because of the dampness and fungous growth in the cellar, the general sickish smell, the draughts of the hallways, or the quality of the well and pump water. These things were bad enough, and these were all that gained belief among the persons whom I knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle, Dr. Elihu Whipple, revealed to me at length the darker, vaguer surmises which formed an undercurrent of folklore among old-time servants and humble folk; surmises which never travelled far, and which were largely forgotten when Providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting modern population. The general fact is, that the house was never regarded by the solid part of the community as in any real sense \u201chaunted\u201d. There were no widespread tales of rattling chains, cold currents of air, extinguished lights, or faces at the window. Extremists sometimes said the house was \u201cunlucky\u201d, but that is as far as even they went. What was really beyond dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or more accurately, had died there, since after some peculiar happenings over sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheer impossibility of renting it. These persons were not all cut off suddenly by any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have naturally had. And those who did not die displayed in varying degree a type of anaemia or consumption, and sometimes a decline of the mental faculties, which spoke ill for the salubriousness of the building. Neighbouring houses, it must be added, seemed entirely free from the noxious quality. This much I knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to shew me the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation. In my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled, and terrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass, and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered. We boys used to overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere and odour of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders. The small-paned windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall-paper, falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained."}

If all went, he would be in a week. I hurried, filled with joy. Was confused when a nurse took me to Edward 's room. The patient stood to greet me, shaking my hand with a smile. I saw that he had the personality that seemed. to him. It was the personality I had found. Which Edward himself had said was the invading soul of his wife. There was the look. The mouth. When he spoke, I sensed the, irony in his voice, a irony of evil. This was the person who had driven my car through the night five months. He was the person I had not seen since that visit when he forgot the doorbell signal. Stirred fears in me. he filled me with the feeling of foreignness. horror. He spoke about arrangements for his release. I had to agree, despite some gaps in his memories. Yet I felt something wsa, and. There were horrors in this that I could not grasp. This was a person, but was it the Edward Derby I had known? If not, who or what was it, and where was Edward? Ought it to be or confined, or should it be removed from the earth? There was a hint of mockery in everything the creature said. The Asenath - eyes added a. mockery to words about ' freedom earned by an confinement '. I must have acted and was to leave. All that day and the, I thought about the probelm. What had happened? What kind of mind looked out through thsoe eyes in Edward 's face? I could think of nothing. This mystery. Stopped trying to do my work. The morning, the hospital called to say the recovered patient was. By evening, I was to a breakdown, a state I admit, though others will say it affected what I saw.\n###\nOf course he must remain some time for observation, but there could be little doubt of the outcome. All going well, he would surely be free in a week. I hastened over in a flood of delight, but stood bewildered when a nurse took me to Edward\u2019s room. The patient rose to greet me, extending his hand with a polite smile; but I saw in an instant that he bore the strangely energised personality which had seemed so foreign to his own nature\u2014the competent personality I had found so vaguely horrible, and which Edward himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his wife. There was the same blazing vision\u2014so like Asenath\u2019s and old Ephraim\u2019s\u2014and the same firm mouth; and when he spoke I could sense the same grim, pervasive irony in his voice\u2014the deep irony so redolent of potential evil. This was the person who had driven my car through the night five months before\u2014the person I had not seen since that brief call when he had forgotten the old-time doorbell signal and stirred such nebulous fears in me\u2014and now he filled me with the same dim feeling of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousness. He spoke affably of arrangements for release\u2014and there was nothing for me to do but assent, despite some remarkable gaps in his recent memories. Yet I felt that something was terribly, inexplicably wrong and abnormal. There were horrors in this thing that I could not reach. This was a sane person\u2014but was it indeed the Edward Derby I had known? If not, who or what was it\u2014and where was Edward? Ought it to be free or confined . . . or ought it to be extirpated from the face of the earth? There was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything the creature said\u2014the Asenath-like eyes lent a special and baffling mockery to certain words about the \u2018early liberty earned by an especially close confinement\u2019. I must have behaved very awkwardly, and was glad to beat a retreat. All that day and the next I racked my brain over the problem. What had happened? What sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in Edward\u2019s face? I could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma, and gave up all efforts to perform my usual work. The second morning the hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged, and by evening I was close to a nervous collapse\u2014a state I admit, though others will vow it coloured my subsequent vision."}

A concoction able to inspire such devotion in its adherents, I thought, must be at least rather singular, and worthy of a connoisseur\u2019s consideration. If it preceded my customary infusion I would sample it forthwith\u2014and so I asked the barista to disclose something of its nature. He was very deliberate, and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he uttered."}

But the family's intense laundry work did not stop with this weekly event. Instead, it actually increased. More and more housework was done by the machines. She now felt tied to them by fear. This fear was as strong as the old fear of hand washing. She completely stopped using strong bleaches. She claimed they were becoming less effective. She spent every posisble minute in the basement laundry room. Sometimes people whispered about her being in other rooms. These rooms were not directly near the dirty laundry baskets. But they were located in a way related to the baskets. Careful observers wondered how real the woman's change in habits was. The neighbor watched closely. Her watching times were short and broken up because of her own chores. But she had a spiteful determiantion most practical housekeepers did not have. She inspected the lanudry processes like never before.\n###\nBut the household\u2019s feverish laundering activities by no means ceased with this weekly ritual. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of the domestic drudgery was handled by the machines which she now bound to her by ties of dread as potent as those of manual scrubbing had been. She altogether abandoned the use of harsh bleaches, alleging that their efficacy was constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent in the basement laundry-room; though there were murmurs now and then of her presence in chambers which, though not actually near the soiled hampers, were yet so situated in relation to soiled hampers that thoughtful observers wondered just how thorough the matron\u2019s change of habits really was. The neighbour, though her periods of scrutiny were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of her own chores, had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical householders lacked; and subjected the laundry\u2019s processes to an inspection such as they had never had before."}

The derrick at the drill site was shaken. The metal of the planes. Drilling equipment was scratched to a finish. Two of the tents were crushed despite their snow walls. Wooden surfaces left in the blast were marked with holes. Stripped of paint. All signs of trcaks in the snow were erased. It is we found none of the specimens in a state fit to remove. We did collect some minerals from collapsed pile. This included soapstone pieces. Their five - shape and patterns of clustered dots caused comparisons. We collected smoe fossil bones. Among these were the of the damaged samples. None of the dogs survived. Theri built snow pen near the camp was ruined. The wind may have caused that. The damage was on the side the camp, which was not the side fcaing the wind. This suggests the animals themselves jumped or broke ou.t All three sleds were missing. We have tried to explain the wind may have blown them into the unknown. The drill and ice - melting machines at the boring were damaged to save.

Their anxiety near the specimens was expected from Lake 's reports.\n###\nOne a\u00ebroplane shelter\u2014all, it seems, had been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate state\u2014was nearly pulverised; and the derrick at the distant boring was entirely shaken to pieces. The exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow banking. Wooden surfaces left out in the blast were pitted and denuded of paint, and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated. It is also true that we found none of the Archaean biological objects in a condition to take outside as a whole. We did gather some minerals from a vast tumbled pile, including several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd five-pointed rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many doubtful comparisons; and some fossil bones, among which were the most typical of the curiously injured specimens. None of the dogs survived, their hurriedly built snow enclosure near the camp being almost wholly destroyed. The wind may have done that, though the greater breakage on the side next the camp, which was not the windward one, suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves. All three sledges were gone, and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown them off into the unknown. The drill and ice-melting machinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage, so we used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past which Lake had blasted. We likewise left at the camp the two most shaken-up of the planes; since our surviving party had only four real pilots\u2014Sherman, Danforth, McTighe, and Ropes\u2014in all, with Danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate. We brought back all the books, scientific equipment, and other incidentals we could find, though much was rather unaccountably blown away. Spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of condition. It was approximately 4 P.M., after wide plane cruising had forced us to give Gedney up for lost, that we sent our guarded message to the Arkham for relaying; and I think we did well to keep it as calm and non-committal as we succeeded in doing. The most we said about agitation concerned our dogs, whose frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor Lake\u2019s accounts."}

The river in between stopped us from trying any of the more southern tunnels on this trip. Indeed, if both nearby ones were blocked, it was doubtful if our batteries would allow an attempt on the netx northerly one. That one was about mile beyond our second choice. As we moved our dim way through the maze with map. Compass, we went through rooms. Halsl in every state of riun. We climbed up slopes, crossed upper floors and bridges and climbed down again. We met blocked doorways and piles of wreckage. Now and then we hurried along well-kept and oddly clean sections. We took wrong turns and went back the way we came. In such cases we removed the blind paper trail we had left. Once in a while we hit the bottom of an open shaft. Daylight poured or trickled down through it. The carved walls along our ptah teased us again and agai.n Many must have tlod sotries of huge historical importance. Olny the hope of later visits made us accept passing them by. As it was, we slowed down now and then and turned on our second torch. If we had more film we would surely have stopped briefly to photograph certain raised carvings. But time-consuming hand copying was clearly not possible. I now come again to a place where the wish to pause. To suggest rather than tell, is very strong. It is needed to tell the rest to explain my action in advising against more exploration. We had moved very close to the calculated site of the tunnel's mouth. We had crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed clearly the tip of a pointed wall. We went down to a ruined hall especially full of decliningly detailed. Clearly ritual carvings of late work. Then, about 8:30 P.M., Danofrth's sharp young nose gave us the first sign of something odd. If we had a dog with us, I guess we would have been warned sooner. At first we colud not say exactly what was wrong with the once crystal-clear air. But after a few seconds our memories reacted very clearly. Let me try to say the thing without pulling back.\n###\nIn the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one\u2014the one less than a mile to the north. The intervening river-course prevented our trying any of the more southerly tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighbouring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one\u2014about a mile beyond our second choice. As we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and compass\u2014traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation, clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and bridges and clambering down again, encountering choked doorways and piles of debris, hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches, taking false leads and retracing our way (in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had left), and once in a while striking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or trickled down\u2014we were repeatedly tantalised by the sculptured walls along our route. Many must have told tales of immense historical importance, and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing them by. As it was, we slowed down once in a while and turned on our second torch. If we had had more films we would certainly have paused briefly to photograph certain bas-reliefs, but time-consuming hand copying was clearly out of the question. I come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to hint rather than state, is very strong. It is necessary, however, to reveal the rest in order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration. We had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel\u2019s mouth\u2014having crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall, and descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanship\u2014when, about 8:30 P.M., Danforth\u2019s keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual. If we had had a dog with us, I suppose we would have been warned before. At first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely. Let me try to state the thing without flinching."}

Some evil breaking of known physical law seemed sure at the start. Here, in a terribly messy home room barely ten steps wide. In an air heavy for living since a home time not less than seven full days ago, there stretched nearly to the sight's limit a mess of orderly cloth. Only the desperation of mental self-protection could possibly blame it on anything. We had earlier set aside, as far as serious thought went, any idea that the piles. Walls of the woven clothes were other than handle-able in amount. How could they be otherwise, when the laundry woman herself could hardly have been told apart from the tired machine at the time when this container gave in to the present unbroken rule of heavy gravity?\n###\nThe effect of the monstrous burden was indescribable, for some fiendish defiance of known physical law seemed certain at the outset.

We had previously dismissed, so far as serious thought was concerned, any theory that the heaps and ramparts of the woven garments were other than manageable in quantity. How could they be otherwise, when the laundress herself could scarcely have been differentiated from the weary automaton at the time when this receptacle succumbed to the present unbroken reign of ponderous gravity?"}

When tapped, it seemed both brittle and hollow. One professor hit it hard with a hammer. It broke with a small, sharp ppo. Noothing came out.

The metal covers opened at the top. Its cellulose pages seemed by the cycles of time they had lived through. I studied the colored, brush - drawn letters of the text. The symbols were unlike the picture writing. Any aplhabet known to learning. I felt a haunting, - awakened memory. It came to me that this was the language used by a trapped mind I had known a in my dreams. That mind was from a asteroid. of the life and knowledge from the planet had survived. The asteroid was a piece of that planet. At the time, I remembered that this level of the record halls was for books dealing with planets not from Earth. I stopped looking at this document. I saw that my torchlight was starting to fade. I put in the battery I carried with me., with the light, I started my feverish running. I ran through tangles of walkways and hallways. and I recognized some shelf. I was bothered by the conditions. They made my footsteps echo in these tombs of death. Silence that had lasted for ages. The marks of my shoes behind me in the dust, for thousansd of years, made me shake., if my dreams held any truth, had feet stepped on those floors. My mind hedl no clue about the gaol of my insane running., some force of power pulled at my will and buried mmeories. I felt I was not running without aim. I came to a slope and followed it to levels. Floors flashed by me as I ran. I did not stop to look at them. In my spinning brain, a rhythm had begun to beat. It made my hand twitch in time with it. I wanted to unolck something. I felt that I knew all the twists and pressuers needed to do it. It would be like a safe with a combination lock. Dream or not, I had known and knew. I did not try to explain to myself how any dream. Piece of learned story, could have taught me a detai.l\n###\nThe latter, as expected, was some twenty by fifteen inches in area, and two inches thick; the thin metal covers opening at the top. Its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they had lived through, and I studied the queerly pigmented, brush-drawn letters of the text\u2014symbols utterly unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet known to human scholarship\u2014with a haunting, half-aroused memory. It came to me that this was the language used by a captive mind I had known slightly in my dreams\u2014a mind from a large asteroid on which had survived much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet whereof it formed a fragment. At the same time I recalled that this level of the archives was devoted to volumes dealing with the non-terrestrial planets. As I ceased poring over this incredible document I saw that the light of my torch was beginning to fail, hence quickly inserted the extra battery I always had with me. Then, armed with the stronger radiance, I resumed my feverish racing through unending tangles of aisles and corridors\u2014recognising now and then some familiar shelf, and vaguely annoyed by the acoustic conditions which made my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs of aeon-long death and silence. The very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden dust made me shudder. Never before, if my mad dreams held anything of truth, had human feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements. Of the particular goal of my insane racing, my conscious mind held no hint. There was, however, some force of evil potency pulling at my dazed will and buried recollections, so that I vaguely felt I was not running at random. I came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths. Floors flashed by me as I raced, but I did not pause to explore them. In my whirling brain there had begun to beat a certain rhythm which set my right hand twitching in unison. I wanted to unlock something, and felt that I knew all the intricate twists and pressures needed to do it. It would be like a modern safe with a combination lock. Dream or not, I had once known and still knew. How any dream\u2014or scrap of unconsciously absorbed legend\u2014could have taught me a detail so minute, so intricate, and so complex, I did not attempt to explain to myself."}

He saw the great central plaza filled with fighting ghouls and night-gaunts. Day, he was sure, must be almost ready to happen. But the army was so strong that surprising the enemy would not be necessary. The greenish glow near the docks still shone faintly. The lack of ghoul sounds showed that the torture of the prisoners had stopped for now. The ghouls gave chattering directions to their mounts. To the group of riderless night-gaunts ahead. Soon they rose in wide, whirirng columns. They swept over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame. Carter was now next to Pickman in the frnot row of ghouls. As they got closer to the foul camp, he saw the moon-beasts were completely unprepared. The three prisoners lay tied up and still beside the fire. Their toad-like captors were slumped around drowsily in no clear order. The almost-human slaves were asleep. Even the guards were avoiding a duty thta must have seemed pointless to them in this place. fianl dive of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden. Each of the greyish toad-like horror.s Their almost-human slaves was grabbed by a group of night-gaunts before any sound was mad.e The moon-beasts, of course, could not speak. Even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them silent. There were struggles from those large, jelly-like mnosters as the mocking night-gaunts grabbed them. But nothing worked against the strength of those black, gripping claws. When a moon-beast struggled too hard, night-gaunt would grab. Pull its shaking pink tentacles. This seemed to hurt so much that the victim would stop fighting. Carter expected to see a lot of killing. But he found the ghouls had much more clever plans. They chattered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts holding the captives. They trusted the rest to instinct. Soon the unlucky creatures were carried silently away into Great Abyss. They would be divided equally among the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dark dwellers. These beings' ways of feeding are not painless for their chosen victims. Meanwhile, the three tied-up ghouls were freed and comforted by their winning relatives. Various groups searched the area for any possible remaining moon-beasts. They also boarded the bad-smelling black ship at the dock. They did this to make sure nothing had escaped the overall defeat.\n###\nWhen, after a great interval, Carter saw again the sickly light of Sarkomand\u2019s nocturnal sky, it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and night-gaunts. Day, he felt sure, must be almost due; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed. The greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly, though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce. Softly glibbering directions to their steeds, and to the flock of riderless night-gaunts ahead, the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame. Carter was now beside Pickman in the front rank of ghouls, and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moon-beasts were totally unprepared. The three prisoners lay bound and inert beside the fire, while their toad-like captors slumped drowsily about in no certain order. The almost-human slaves were asleep, even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctory. The final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden, each of the greyish toad-like blasphemies and their almost-human slaves being seized by a group of night-gaunts before a sound was made. The moon-beasts, of course, were voiceless; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence. Horrible were the writhings of those great jellyish abnormalities as the sardonic night-gaunts clutched them, but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons. When a moon-beast writhed too violently, a night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles. Carter expected to see much slaughter, but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans. They glibbered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts which held the captives, trusting the rest to instinct; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the Great Abyss, to be distributed impartially amongst the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims. Meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk, whilst various parties searched the neighbourhood for possible remaining moon-beasts, and boarded the evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat."}

The ruin of cities from THE rise of mountains, the spinning taering of continents, the earthquake shaking of land. Other natural reasons was often recorded. It was odd to see how fewer.

The vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last general centre of the race; built early in the Cretaceous age after a titanic earth-buckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not far distant. It appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of all, where reputedly the first Old Ones had settled on a primal sea-bottom.

They were to demolish with axes or gunpow.\n###\nEsek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal. The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast, then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipple\u2019s belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness, and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistle\u2019s range; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipple\u2019s party which was to storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river party\u2019s readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm."}

Since changing his location would take away the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have helped him to start over in a different area just then. Jdugment demanded that he fix his relations with the people of Providence. Then his presence might no longer cause talk, obvious excuses to run errands elsewhere. A general feeling of restraint.

Reasons so.\n###\nHis elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them\u2014a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongue\u2019s end. About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress."}

Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head. Inspector Legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created. One sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement, and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas. No recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object, yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone. The figure, which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study, was between seven and eight inches in height, and of exquisitely artistic workmanship. It represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind. This thing, which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy, was of a somewhat bloated corpulence, and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters. The tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block, the seat occupied the centre, whilst the long, curved claws of the doubled-up, crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal. The cephalopod head was bent forward, so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher\u2019s elevated knees. The aspect of the whole was abnormally life-like, and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown."}

On the table lay a white figure. It was a baby byo, naked and not awake. On the other side stood huge, grinning woman. In her right hand was a shining knife with a handle. In her left hand was a pale metal bowl of shape. It had detailed designs on it and side handles. She was chanting a rough ritual in a language Gilman could not understand. It seemed like something carefully referenced in Necronomicon. As the scene became clear, he saw woman lean forward. She held the bowl across the table. He could not control his own movements. He reached far forward and took it in btoh hadns. He noticed it was quite At the same moment, the disgusting form of Brown Jenkin climbed over the edge of the triangular black hole on his left. The woman now signaled him to hold the bowl in a certain position. She raised the knife above the white victim. Her right hand reached as as it could. The fanged, furry thing began giggling a continuation of the unknown ritual. The witch croaked hateful replies. Gilman felt a sharp, biting disgust shoot thorugh his mental and emotional freeze. The metal bowl shook in his hands. A second later, the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely. He dropped the bowl with a bell-like clang. His hands shot out wildly to stop the monstrous act. In an instant, he moved up the sloping floor around the table's en.d He pulled the knife from the woman's claws. He sent it clattering over the edge of the triangular hole.\n###\nAhead raced the small, kaleidoscopic polyhedron, and all through the churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the vague tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and unendurable climax. He seemed to know what was coming\u2014the monstrous burst of Walpurgis-rhythm in whose cosmic timbre would be concentrated all the primal, ultimate space-time seethings which lie behind the massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periods. But all this vanished in a second. He was again in the cramped, violet-litten peaked space with the slanting floor, the low cases of ancient books, the bench and table, the queer objects, and the triangular gulf at one side. On the table lay a small white figure\u2014an infant boy, unclothed and unconscious\u2014while on the other side stood the monstrous, leering old woman with a gleaming, grotesque-hafted knife in her right hand, and a queerly proportioned pale metal bowl covered with curiously chased designs and having delicate lateral handles in her left. She was intoning some croaking ritual in a language which Gilman could not understand, but which seemed like something guardedly quoted in the Necronomicon. As the scene grew clear he saw the ancient crone bend forward and extend the empty bowl across the table\u2014and unable to control his own motions, he reached far forward and took it in both hands, noticing as he did so its comparative lightness. At the same moment the disgusting form of Brown Jenkin scrambled up over the brink of the triangular black gulf on his left. The crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in a certain position while she raised the huge, grotesque knife above the small white victim as high as her right hand could reach. The fanged, furry thing began tittering a continuation of the unknown ritual, while the witch croaked loathsome responses. Gilman felt a gnawing, poignant abhorrence shoot through his mental and emotional paralysis, and the light metal bowl shook in his grasp. A second later the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely, and he dropped the bowl with a resounding bell-like clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous deed. In an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the table and wrenched the knife from the old woman\u2019s claws; sending it clattering over the brink of the narrow triangular gulf."}

Under the conditions, it could not have been noticed. You muts remember that I was in a building. The building was almost fresh and new. Only the walls were old. I was surrounded by a well-balanced staff of servants. Because of this, fear would have bene silly. This was true even considering the place. What I remembered later is only this. I know my old black cat's moods very well. He was clearly alert and anxious. This was completely unlike his normal nature. He moved from room to room. He was restless and disturbed. He constantly sniffed at the walls. These walls weer part of the old Gothic structure. I know how common this sounds. It is like the dog in a ghost story. That dog always growls before its master sees the ghost. Yet I cannot leave it out. The next day, a servant complained. He spoke all the cats in the house were restless. He came to me in my study. My study was a tall west room on the second floor. It had groined arches and black oak panels. It had a triple Gothic window. The window looked over the limestone cliff and the empty valley. As he spoke, I even saw the black form of Nigger-Man. He was creeping along the west wall. He was scratching at the new panels. These panels covered the ancient stone. I told the man there must be a strange smell. Or there was an emanation from the old stonework. Human senses could not perceive it. But it affected the delicate senses of cats. It affected them even through the new wood. I truly believed this. The fellow suggested mice or rats might be there. I mentioned that there had been no rats for three hundred yeasr. Even the field mice from the country around were hardly found. They were not found in these high walls. They were never known to stray there. That afternoon, I called on Capt. Norrys. He assured me it would be very incredible. It would be incredible for field mice to infest the priory. They would not come in such a sudden and new way. That night, I did not use a valet as usual. I went to bed in the west tower room. I had chosen this room as my own. You reached it frmo the study. You used a stone staircase and a short gallery. The satircase was partly ancient. The gallery was completely restored. room was round and very high. It had no wooden panels on the walls. It was hung with tapestries. I had chosen these tapestries myself in London.\n###\nIt was so simple as to be almost negligible, and could not possibly have been noticed under the circumstances; for it must be recalled that since I was in a building practically fresh and new except for the walls, and surrounded by a well-balanced staff of servitors, apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality. What I afterward remembered is merely this\u2014that my old black cat, whose moods I know so well, was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an extent wholly out of keeping with his natural character. He roved from room to room, restless and disturbed, and sniffed constantly about the walls which formed part of the old Gothic structure. I realise how trite this sounds\u2014like the inevitable dog in the ghost story, which always growls before his master sees the sheeted figure\u2014yet I cannot consistently suppress it. The following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the cats in the house. He came to me in my study, a lofty west room on the second story, with groined arches, black oak panelling, and a triple Gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley; and even as he spoke I saw the jetty form of Nigger-Man creeping along the west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient stone. I told the man that there must be some singular odour or emanation from the old stonework, imperceptible to human senses, but affecting the delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork. This I truly believed, and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats, I mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years, and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be found in these high walls, where they had never been known to stray. That afternoon I called on Capt. Norrys, and he assured me that it would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden and unprecedented fashion. That night, dispensing as usual with a valet, I retired in the west tower chamber which I had chosen as my own, reached from the study by a stone staircase and short gallery\u2014the former partly ancient, the latter entirely restored. This room was circular, very high, and without wainscotting, being hung with arras which I had myself chosen in London."}

They spoke of Keziah Mason. Elwood agreed that Gilman had reasons for thinking she might have found. The groups these witches belonged to protected. Passed down secrets from, forgotten ages.

Who can say what lies under the stories of broomstick rides through the night?\n###\nFor three days Gilman and Elwood canvassed the local museums in an effort to identify the strange spiky image, but always without success. In every quarter, however, interest was intense; for the utter alienage of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity. One of the small radiating arms was broken off and subjected to chemical analysis, and the result is still talked about in college circles. Professor Ellery found platinum, iron, and tellurium in the strange alloy; but mixed with these were at least three other apparent elements of high atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely powerless to classify. Not only did they fail to correspond with any known element, but they did not even fit the vacant places reserved for probable elements in the periodic system. The mystery remains unsolved to this day, though the image is on exhibition at the museum of Miskatonic University. On the morning of April 27 a fresh rat-hole appeared in the room where Gilman was a guest, but Dombrowski tinned it up during the day. The poison was not having much effect, for scratchings and scurryings in the walls were virtually undiminished. Elwood was out late that night, and Gilman waited up for him. He did not wish to go to sleep in a room alone\u2014especially since he thought he had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams. He wondered who she was, and what had been near her rattling the tin can in a rubbish-heap at the mouth of a squalid courtyard. The crone had seemed to notice him and leer evilly at him\u2014though perhaps this was merely his imagination. The next day both youths felt very tired, and knew they would sleep like logs when night came. In the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed Gilman, and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic and folklore which seemed so darkly probable. They spoke of old Keziah Mason, and Elwood agreed that Gilman had good scientific grounds for thinking she might have stumbled on strange and significant information. The hidden cults to which these witches belonged often guarded and handed down surprising secrets from elder, forgotten aeons; and it was by no means impossible that Keziah had actually mastered the art of passing through dimensional gates. Tradition emphasises the uselessness of material barriers in halting a witch\u2019s motions; and who can say what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the night?"}

They went toawrd the thin grey sides of those impossible mountains. Leng was said to lie beyond those mountains. Far they flew above the clouds. Finally, the famous mountain tops lay below them. The people of Inganok have never seen these tops. They always lie in high spinning clouds of shining mist. Carter saw them very clearly as they passed below. He saw strange caves on their highest peaks. These caves made him think of those on Ngranek. But he did not ask his captor about these things. He noticed that both the man and the horse-headed shantak seemed oddly afraid of them. They hurried past nervously. They showed great stress until the caves were far behind. The shantak now flew lower. It showed a grey empty plain under the roof of cloud. Small weak fires shone at great distances on the plain. As they went down, lone huts of granite appeared at times. Bleak stone villages appeared. Their tiny windows glowed with pale light. A sharp buzzing of pipes came from those huts and villages. A sickening rattle of crotala came from them. This proved at once that the people of Inganok are right in their geography rumors. Travelers have heard such sounds before. They knwo these sounds only come from the cold desert plateau. Healthy people never visit that haunted place of evil and mystery. That place is Leng. Around dark shapes were dancing near the weak fires. Carter was curious about what kind of beings they might be. No healthy people have ever been to Leng. place is known only by its fires and stone huts seen from far away. Very slowly and awkwardly, those shapes jumped. They twisted and bent in a crazy way that was not good to see. So Carter did not wonder at the huge evil stories about them. He did not wonder at the fear all dreamland has for their hated frozen plateau. As the shantak flew lower, the ugliness of the dancers seemed somewhat familiar in a hellish way. The prisoner kept looking hard. He kept trying to remember where he had seen such creatures before. They jumped as if they had hooves instead of feet. They seemed to wear a kind of wig or headpiece with small horns. They had no other clothing. But most of them were quite hairy.\n###\nThere now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space, endlessly up and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which Leng was said to lie. Far above the clouds they flew, till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of Inganok have never seen, and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist. Carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below, and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on Ngranek; but he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horse-headed shantak appeared oddly fearful of them, hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far in the rear. The shantak now flew lower, revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires. As they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light. And there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that Inganok\u2019s people are right in their geographick rumours. For travellers have heard such sounds before, and know that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit; that haunted place of evil and mystery which is Leng. Around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing, and Carter was curious as to what manner of beings they might be; for no healthy folk have ever been to Leng, and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar. Very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap, and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold; so that Carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend, or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau. As the shantak flew lower, the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity; and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures before. They leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet, and seemed to wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns. Of other clothing they had none, but most of them were quite furry."}

Everyone wondered why the ruined drug addict had such a portrait. Everyone wondered except the bank thief. He watched the invading poilce officers with worry. He had seen a little more under Old Bugs' mask of complete ruin. Then the picture was given to Trever. The yonug man changed. After his first shock, he wrapped the tissue paper around the portrait again. He seemed to want to protect it from the dirtiness of the plcae. Then he looked for a long time at the body on the floor. He saw its great height. He saw the noble shape of its face. This seemed clear now that the weak flame of life had gone out. No, he said quickly when asked. He did not know who was in the picture. He added it was. Old that no one could be expectde to recognize it no.w But Alfred Trever did not tell the truth. Many people guessed this when he offered to take care of the body. He offered to make sure it was buried in Appleton. An exact copy of that picture hung on library fireplace in his home. All his life he had known and loved the original person. I do not wish to speak of the events at the Norton Mine on October 18th. Only a sense of duty to science makes me remember. I recall these scenes in the last years of my life. They are filled with a fear that is twice as sharp because I cannot fully explain it. But I believe I should tell what I know before I die. I should tell of theof Juan Romero. My name and background need not be told to future people. In fact, I think it is better they are not told. When a man suddenly moves to the States. The Colonies, he leaves his past behind. Truly, what I once was has no connection to my story. Except perhaps one fact. During my service in India, I was more comfortbale with white-bearded local teachers than with my fellow officers. I had studied a fair amount of strange Eastern knowledge. Then disasters came upon me. These brought about my new life in America's huge West. In that life, I found it good to accept a name. It is my present name. It is very common and has no meaning.\n###\nNo one seemed able to place the subject, and all wondered that the drug-degraded derelict should have such a portrait in his possession\u2014that is, all but the bank defaulter, who was meanwhile eyeing the intruding bluecoats rather uneasily. He had seen a little deeper beneath Old Bugs\u2019 mask of utter degradation. Then the picture was passed to Trever, and a change came over the youth. After the first start, he replaced the tissue wrapping around the portrait, as if to shield it from the sordidness of the place. Then he gazed long and searchingly at the figure on the floor, noting its great height, and the aristocratic cast of features which seemed to appear now that the wretched flame of life had flickered out. No, he said hastily, as the question was put to him, he did not know the subject of the picture. It was so old, he added, that no one now could be expected to recognise it. But Alfred Trever did not speak the truth, as many guessed when he offered to take charge of the body and secure its interment in Appleton. Over the library mantel in his home hung the exact replica of that picture, and all his life he had known and loved its original. Of the events which took place at the Norton Mine on October 18th and 19th, 1894, I have no desire to speak. A sense of duty to science is all that impels me to recall, in these last years of my life, scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because I cannot wholly define it. But I believe that before I die I should tell what I know of the\u2014shall I say transition\u2014of Juan Romero. My name and origin need not be related to posterity; in fact, I fancy it is better that they should not be, for when a man suddenly migrates to the States or the Colonies, he leaves his past behind him. Besides, what I once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative; save perhaps the fact that during my service in India I was more at home amongst white-bearded native teachers than amongst my brother-officers. I had delved not a little into odd Eastern lore when overtaken by the calamities which brought about my new life in America\u2019s vast West\u2014a life wherein I found it well to accept a name\u2014my present one\u2014which is very common and carries no meaning."}

This complex document seemed to hold a lasting evil. This evil was worse than any government trick I knew. The evil was clearly in the forms themselves, not the person filing them. My acconutant's less organized collection of various information confirmed this feeling. This included rumors from client complaints, pieces from finance magazines, copies of audit notices from other accountants. I cannot possibly list all this material. My accountant was a very thorough record-keeper. He was very interested in the feared tax returns. But I can mention a few mani points. These points are notable because they appear in many reports from different places. For example, client talk almost all agreed. They said the strange. Hard-to-understand schedules of the process had a very large. There had been clients, especially old Mr. Whateley, who would not accept the extra worksheets. Also, at least three clear stories were about the odd, almost logical or devilish calculations. These calculations came from depreciation tables and groups of deductions in that area. These later stories interested me deeply. This was because of what I suffered in my younger years. But I felt that in each case, most of the meaning was hidden. It was hidden by additions from the common collection of financial horror stories.\n###\nIt may well be imagined how profoundly I was afflicted by the annals of the tax code. In this labyrinthine document there seemed to me to brood a persistent malevolence beyond anything in bureaucratic artifice as I had known it; a malevolence clearly connected with the forms and not with the filer. This impression was confirmed by my accountant\u2019s less systematic array of miscellaneous data\u2014rumours transcribed from client complaints, cuttings from financial journals, copies of audit-notices by fellow-practitioners, and the like. All of this material I cannot hope to recount, for my accountant was a tireless archivist and very deeply interested in the dreaded returns; but I may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their recurrence through many reports from diverse sources. For example, the client gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the arcane and inscrutable schedules of the process a vast supremacy in baleful influence. There had been clients\u2014especially old Mr. Whateley\u2014who would not brook the supplemental worksheets, and at least three well-defined anecdotes bore upon the queer quasi-logical or diabolic calculations assumed by depreciation tables and patches of deductions in that region. These latter narratives interested me profoundly, on account of what I had endured in my early years, but I felt that most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by additions from the common stock of fiscal horror lore."}

My childhood fantasies were woven around its oak trees. Well I came to know the tree spirits that ruled. I watched their dances in the light of a fading moon. But I must not speak of these things. I will tell of the tomb in the part of the hillsied bushes. It is the tomb of the Hydes family. This was an and family. Their descendant was placed inside its space decades before I was bonr. The vault I mean is made of granite. It is worn and stained by generations of mist and damp. It is set itno the hillside. the entrance is. The door is a, threatening slab of stone. It hangs on iron hinges. It is held in a way by iron chains. This was a style from half a century. The home of the family whose members are buried stood on top of the hill above the tomb. But it burned down after being struck by lightning. locals talk about the midnight storm that destroyed the house. They speak in, voices. They mention what they call \" anger. \" This increased my fascination with the forest - darkened tomb in years. one man died in the fire. When the of the Hydes family was buried in this, place, the urn of ashes came from a land. The family had moved after mansion burned. No one remains to place flowers before the granite door. dare to face the shadows that seem to cling to the water - worn stones. I will forget the afternoon I found the - hidden tomb. It was mid - summer. The magic of Nature changes the forest landscape into one, mass of green. The senses are on the waves of plants. The smells of earth. In such a place, the mind loses its sense of scale. Time and space seem and. Echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat on the mind.\n###\nDown its moss-covered slopes my first steps of infancy were taken, and around its grotesquely gnarled oak trees my first fancies of boyhood were woven. Well did I come to know the presiding dryads of those trees, and often have I watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of a waning moon\u2014but of these things I must not now speak. I will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets; the deserted tomb of the Hydes, an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth. The vault to which I refer is of ancient granite, weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations. Excavated back into the hillside, the structure is visible only at the entrance. The door, a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone, hangs upon rusted iron hinges, and is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of heavy iron chains and padlocks, according to a gruesome fashion of half a century ago. The abode of the race whose scions are here inurned had once crowned the declivity which holds the tomb, but had long since fallen victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of lightning. Of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion, the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices; alluding to what they call \u201cdivine wrath\u201d in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination which I felt for the forest-darkened sepulchre. One man only had perished in the fire. When the last of the Hydes was buried in this place of shade and stillness, the sad urnful of ashes had come from a distant land; to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned down. No one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal, and few care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely about the water-worn stones. I shall never forget the afternoon when first I stumbled upon the half-hidden house of death. It was in mid-summer, when the alchemy of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation. In such surroundings the mind loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness."}

The presence of the three men seemed to wake the dying creature. It began to speak unclearly without turning or lifting its head. Dr. Armitage did not write down what it muttered. But he states firmly that nothing in English was spoken. At first, sounds could not be connected to any Earth language. But near the end, there came some broken pieces clearly taken from the Necronomicon. This was that monsrtous insult against sacred things which the creature had died trying to find. These pieces, as Armitage remembers them, went something like \"N'gai, n'gha'ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y'hah. Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth...\" They faded into silence as the whippoorwills screamed in rhythmic incraeses of unholy expectation.\n###\nAs the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it began to mumble without turning or raising its head.

It was solid work from the seventeenth century, or I was wrong. Pickamn said this was what he meant. It was an opening in the network of tunnels that once went under the hill. I casually noticed it did not seem to be closed with bricks. A heavy wooden disc seemed to cover it. Thinking of the things this well might have been linked to, if Pickman's wild suggestions were not just words, I shivered a little. Then I turned to follow him up a step. We went through a narrwo door into a fairly large room. It had a wooden floro and was set up as a studio. An acetylene gas lamp gave the light needed for work. The unfinished pictures on easels. Leaning against the walls were as horrible as the finished ones upstairs. They showed the artist's careful methods. Scenes wree outlined with great care. Pencilled guide lines showed the small precision which Pickman used to get the right view. The man was great. I say tihs even no,w knowing what I know. A large camera on a table caught my attention. Pickman told me he used it to take pictures of scenes for backgrounds. This let him paint them from photos in the studio. He did not need to carry his equipment around town for this or thta view. He thought a photo was just as good as a real scene. Model for long work. He said he used them often. There was something very upsetting about the sickening sketches. Half-finished monsters that stared from every side of the room. When Pickman suddenly revealed a huge cavnas on the side away from the light, I could not stop a loud scream. It was the second srceam I had made that night. It echoed and echoed through the dim arched ceiling of that old and salty cellar. I had to hold back a flood of feeling that threatened to come out as crazy laughter. Merciful Creaotr! I do not know how much was real. How much was feverish imagination. It does not seem to me that earth can contain a dream like that! It was a huge and unnamed evil thing with bright red eyes. It held in bony calws something that had been a man. It was chewing on the head liek a child nibbles a piece of candy.\n###\nWe walked nearer, and I saw that it must be five feet across, with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the ground level\u2014solid work of the seventeenth century, or I was much mistaken. That, Pickman said, was the kind of thing he had been talking about\u2014an aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the hill. I noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up, and that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover. Thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if Pickman\u2019s wild hints had not been mere rhetoric, I shivered slightly; then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size, provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio. An acetylene gas outfit gave the light necessary for work. The unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs, and shewed the painstaking methods of the artist. Scenes were blocked out with extreme care, and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which Pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions. The man was great\u2014I say it even now, knowing as much as I do. A large camera on a table excited my notice, and Pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds, so that he might paint them from photographs in the studio instead of carting his outfit around the town for this or that view. He thought a photograph quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained work, and declared he employed them regularly. There was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and half-finished monstrosities that leered around from every side of the room, and when Pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light I could not for my life keep back a loud scream\u2014the second I had emitted that night. It echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar, and I had to choke back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter. Merciful Creator! Eliot, but I don\u2019t know how much was real and how much was feverish fancy. It doesn\u2019t seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that! It was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes, and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man, gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy."}

The people in the nearby apartments were still arguing uselessly about what to think. Do about the widespread cold feeling. Exasperated by the constant attack of the northern wind over the last two weeks, the area's people had become more watchful about sources of haet. On this occasion, the shared laundry worker Mrs. Henderson, feeling a very strange urge, entered the business \"Soap Suds Sanctum\" on Angell Street one early afternoon after a short trip. Mr. Jacobs ran this place, which its sign said was for cleaning clothes and linens. When checked for heat, this place showed the surprising fact that its inside was only a thick, sleepy heta. This heat came from \"Dryer Apparatus No. 7\", which would blow its harmful air in a spinning rage just outside the glass door. Mr. Jacobs felt he must not examine its mechanical heart. The local authorities at the station did not know what to do. The place did not break city rules, but the comfort it provided was unnatural. They compromised on the inspector's advice. They ignored the business but banned it from openly advertising its strange climate. Later, there were rumors that it was felt in the steam near the dyeing tanks, though it never showed openly beyond its doorway.\n###\nIt was in January of this year, whilst the tenants of the adjacent tenements were still debating vainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the pervasive and gelid atmosphere, that the incident of the laundromat occurred. Exasperated by the relentless siege of the boreal wind during the previous fortnight, the inhabitants of the quarter had adopted an increased vigilance concerning sources of warmth; and on this occasion the common laundress Mrs. Henderson, under a most peculiar compulsion, entered after a short journey one early afternoon the establishment \"Soap Suds Sanctum\" on Angell Street, under proprietor Mr. Jacobs, maintained according to its sign for the cleansing of vestments and linens. When investigated for thermal properties, this place revealed the astonishing fact that its interior consisted exclusively of a dense, soporific heat, generated by \"Dryer Apparatus No. 7\", which would emit its baleful gusts in a cyclonic fury just beyond the glass-paned door and whose mechanical soul Mr. Jacobs felt himself in duty bound not to examine. The municipal authorities at the precinct, at a loss what to do in view of the non-violation of the civic codes on the one hand and of the unnatural comfort of the environment on the other hand, compromised on the inspector\u2019s recommendation by ignoring the establishment but forbidding it an overt advertisement of its climatic anomaly. There were later rumours of its having been sensed in the vapour near the dye-vats, though it never openly manifested beyond the threshold."}

These shapes seemed not just uneven. Built on a strange symmetry he could not understand. The railing was chest-high, delicate, and made with fantastic skill. Along the rail, at regular short spaces, were small figures of odd design. Like the whole railing, they seemed made of a shiny metal. Its color could not be told in this mix of bright lights. Their true nature was a complete mystery. They showed a ridged, barrel-shaped object. Thin horizontal arms spread out like spokes from a center ring. Vertical knobs or bulbs stuck out frmo the top and bottom of the barrel. Each knob was the center of a system of five long, flat, arms that tapered to a point. These were arranged around it like a starfish's arms. They were nearly flat but curved slightly away from the central barrel. The base of the bottom knob was joined to the long railing at a very thin point. Several figures had broken off and wree gone. The figures were about fuor and a half inches tall. The pointed arms gave them a width of about two. A half inches at most.\n###\nThe pavement from which he easily raised himself was of a veined, polished stone beyond his power to identify, and the tiles were cut in bizarre-angled shapes which struck him as less asymmetrical than based on some unearthly symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend. The balustrade was chest-high, delicate, and fantastically wrought, while along the rail were ranged at short intervals little figures of grotesque design and exquisite workmanship. They, like the whole balustrade, seemed to be made of some sort of shining metal whose colour could not be guessed in this chaos of mixed effulgences; and their nature utterly defied conjecture. They represented some ridged, barrel-shaped object with thin horizontal arms radiating spoke-like from a central ring, and with vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from the head and base of the barrel. Each of these knobs was the hub of a system of five long, flat, triangularly tapering arms arranged around it like the arms of a starfish\u2014nearly horizontal, but curving slightly away from the central barrel. The base of the bottom knob was fused to the long railing with so delicate a point of contact that several figures had been broken off and were missing. The figures were about four and a half inches in height, while the spiky arms gave them a maximum diameter of about two and a half inches."}

The chase was moving down a different street.. This showed the group was not directly following me. They had not spotted me. They were simpply following a general plan to block my escape. This meant all roads leaving Innsmouth were likely watched in the same way. The locals could not have known which path I planned to take. If tthis was true, I would have to flee acorss the countryside, avoiding all roads. But how could I do that? The whole area around was marshy and full of creeks. For a moment, my mind spun.

Since the pursuit was down another street, it was plain that the party was not following me directly. It had not seen me, but was simply obeying a general plan of cutting off my escape.

It was nearly impossible because the steps were monstrously big. They were made for gugs. So they were almost a yard high. Carter could not make a good guess of their number. He became very tired very soon. The never-tiring and flexible ghouls had to help him. During the whole endless climb, there was a hidden danger. The danger was of being found and chased. No gug dares lift the stone door to the forest. This is because of Great Ones' curse. But there are no such rules for the tower and the steps. Escaped ghasts are often chased all the way to the top. ears of gugs are very sharp. The bare feet and hands of the climbers could be heard easily. Thsi would happen when the city woke up. It would take only a little time for the striding giants. They are used to hunting ghasts in the vaults of Zin. They are used to seeing without light. They would catch their smaller, slower prey on those Cyclopean steps. It was very discouraging to think about. The silent chasing gugs would not be heard at all. They would appear suddenly and shockingly in the dark. They would appear right upon the climbers. Nor the traditional fear gugs have for ghouls could be trusted. This was especially true in that strange place. The advantages were so strongly with the gugs. There was also some danger from the sneaky, poisonous ghasts. They often hopped up into the tower. They did this during the sleep hour of the gugs. If the gugs slept long. The ghasts came back soon from their job in the cave, the smell of the climbers might be found easily. Those disgusting and unfriendly things might find it. In that case, it would almost be better to be eatne by a gug. Then, after ages of climbing, a cough came from the darkness above. Things took a very serious and surprising turn. It was clear that a ghast, or maybe more, had wandered into that tower. This happened before Carter and his guides came. It was also clear that this danger was very near. After a second without breathing, lead ghoul pushed Carter to the wall. He placed his two relatives in the best positions. He raised the old slate tombstone. It was ready for a powerful hit. This would happen whenever the enemy came into view. Ghouls can see in the drak. The group was not in as bad a situation as Carter would have been alone.\n###\nThere now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness; made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps, which were fashioned for gugs, and were therefore nearly a yard high. Of their number Carter could form no just estimate, for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him. All through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the Great Ones\u2019 curse, there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps, and escaped ghasts are often chased even to the very top. So sharp are the ears of gugs, that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke; and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants, accustomed from their ghast-hunts in the vaults of Zin to seeing without light, to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those Cyclopean steps. It was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all, but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers. Nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs. There was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts, which frequently hopped up into the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs. If the gugs slept long, and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern, the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and ill-disposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gug. Then, after aeons of climbing, there came a cough from the darkness above; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn. It was clear that a ghast, or perhaps even more, had strayed into that tower before the coming of Carter and his guides; and it was equally clear that this peril was very close. After a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed Carter to the wall and arranged his two kinsfolk in the best possible way, with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight. Ghouls can see in the dark, so the party was not as badly off as Carter would have been alone."}

Filled with a feeling that our solid world is only a tiny piece in a vast. That unknown realms push on. Soak into the known world at every point, Northam in his youth. Early manhood drank deeply firsst from formal religion, then form hidden mysteries. However, Nohwere could he find peace and satisfaction. As he grew odler, the dullness. Limits of life became more. More mmaddening to him. During the 1890s he experimented with Satanism. At all times he eagerly read any belief. Theory that seemed to offer escape from the narrow views of science. Thee boring, unchanging laws of Nature. Works like Ignatius Donnelly's fanciful story of Atlantis he read with great interest. A dozen little-known thinkers before Charles Fort fascinated him with their odd ideas. He would travel mmiles to follow a secret village tale of abnormal wonder. Once he went into the dessert of Araby to findd a Nameless City of faint rumor, which no man has ever see.n A tesaing belief grew in him. He believed that somewhere an easy gate existed. If one found it, it would freely let him into those outer depths. The echoes of those depths rattled so fiantly at the back of hhis memory. It might be in the visible world. It might be only in his mind. Perhaps he held within his own partly explored brain that secret link. It would wake him to older and future lives in forgotten ddimensions.

Nowhere, however, could he find ease and content; and as he grew older the staleness and limitations of life became more and more maddening to him. During the \u2019nineties he dabbled in Satanism, and at all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which seemed to promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying laws of Nature. Books like Ignatius Donnelly\u2019s chimerical account of Atlantis he absorbed with zest, and a dozen obscure precursors of Charles Fort enthralled him with their vagaries. He would travel leagues to follow up a furtive village tale of abnormal wonder, and once went into the desert of Araby to seek a Nameless City of faint report, which no man has ever beheld. There rose within him the tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed, which if one found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled so dimly at the back of his memory. It might be in the visible world, yet it might be only in his mind and soul. Perhaps he held within his own half-explored brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions; which would bind him to the stars, and to the infinities and eternities beyond them."}

The time, he saw a thing, those trees and bushes bending. When the swishing sound got had the courage to step up to where he had heard it. Look at the ground. It was all mud and water. The sky was. The rain was wiping out all tracks about as. Starting at the valley mouth, where the trees had moved, there were some of those prints as barrels, like he saw Monday. But that is not the trouble \u2014 that was the beginning. Zeb was calling people up. Everybody was listening on the line when a call from Seth Bishop 's interrupted.

Stepping, heading for the house. she spoke of a smell. She said her boy Cha'ncey was screaming that it was like what he smelled up at the Whateley ruins Monday morning. The dogs were all barking and whining. she let out a yell. She said the shed down the road had caved in as if the storm had blown it over. The wind was not to do that. Everybody was listening, and we could hear lots of people on the wire gasping. All at Sally, she yelled. She said the yard picket fence had crumbled up, though there was no sign of what did it. everybody on the line could hear Cha'ncey and Seth Bishop yelling. Sally was shrieking that something had struck the house. It was not lightning or anything, but something against the front. It kept launching itself against it., though you cuold not see anything out the windows. And... And... And... Sally she yelled out, ' Oh help, the house is caving in.

No wonder sensitive students feel fear at the Puritan age in Massachusetts. Very little is known about what happened below the surface. Very little is known, but such a terrible decay sometimes appears in horrible glimpses. The witchcraft terror shows a horrible light on what was in menn's troubled minds. But even that is a small matter. There was no beauty. There was no freedom. We can see that from the buildings and household items left behind. We can see it from the harmful speeches of the narrow-minded religious leaders. Inside that old iron restraitn hid madness, ugliness, wrong desires, and evil.

Coudl I still find the [THING] of the writing - master? Could I still find the tower where S'gg'ha had carved certain pictures on the blank spaces of the walls? S'gg'ha was a captive mind from the [THING] - headed plant eaters of Antarctica. Would the passage at the second level down, to the hall of the alien minds, be still unblocked. In that hall, the captive mind of an unbelievable being had kept a certain thing. The being was a half - palstic creature from the hollow inside of an unknown planet beyond Pluto. It was from eighteen million years in the future. It had modelled this thing from clay. I shut my eyes and put my [THNIG] to my [THING]. It was a useless, pitiful effort to drive these insane dream pieces from my mind. Then, for the first time, I felt sharply the coolness, movement. Dampness of the surrounding air. Shuddering, I realized that a huge chani of age - dead black holes must indeed be opening somewhere beyond. I thought of the frightful rooms. Slopes as I remembered them from my dreams.

In my shocking outbursts, I paid no attention to the laws of God, Man. Then, a sound like a thunderclap, louder than the noise of the drunken party, split the roof. It made the loud group fall silent in fear. Flames like tongues and burning hot winds swallowed the [THING]. The party - goers were struck with terror. This disaster seemed to go beyond the limits of normal Nature. They ran screaming into the night. I alone stayed behind. A low, crawling fear, which I had never felt before, kept me fixed to my seat. Then a second horror filled my soul. What if I was burned alive into ashes? What if my [THING] was scattered by the four widns? I might never lie in the tobm of the Hydes! Was my coffin not prepared for me? Did I not have a right to rest forever with the descendants of Sir Geoffrey Hyde? No! I would claim my right to death.

One was the spy who had followed me to the tomb. [THING] was pouring down heavily. On the southern horizon, there were flashes of lightning. That lightning had just passed over our heads. My father stood by. His [THING] was marked with sorrow. I shouted my demands to be placed inside the tomb. He often told my captors to treat me as gently as possible. On the [THING] of the ruined cellar, there was a blackened circle. It showed where a violent bolt from the [THING] had struck. From this spot, a group of curious villagers with lanterns were prying out a small box. The box was of old workmanship. The thunderbolt had revealed it. Despite my useless. Now pointless struggling, I watched the [THING] look at the found treasure. I was allowed to share in what they found. The box 's fastenings were broken by the strike that had uncovered it. It held many papers and valuable objects. But I saw only one thing. It was a porcelain miniature of a young [THING]. He wore a smartly curled bag - wig. It had the initials \" J. H. \".\n###\nGay blasphemy poured in torrents from my lips, and in my shocking sallies I heeded no law of God, Man, or Nature. Suddenly a peal of thunder, resonant even above the din of the swinish revelry, clave the very roof and laid a hush of fear upon the boisterous company. Red tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the house; and the roysterers, struck with terror at the descent of a calamity which seemed to transcend the bounds of unguided Nature, fled shrieking into the night. I alone remained, riveted to my seat by a grovelling fear which I had never felt before. And then a second horror took possession of my soul. Burnt alive to ashes, my body dispersed by the four winds, I might never lie in the tomb of the Hydes! Was not my coffin prepared for me? Had I not a right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of Sir Geoffrey Hyde? Aye! I would claim my heritage of death, even though my soul go seeking through the ages for another corporeal tenement to represent it on that vacant slab in the alcove of the vault. Jervas Hyde should never share the sad fate of Palinurus! As the phantom of the burning house faded, I found myself screaming and struggling madly in the arms of two men, one of whom was the spy who had followed me to the tomb. Rain was pouring down in torrents, and upon the southern horizon were flashes of the lightning that had so lately passed over our heads. My father, his face lined with sorrow, stood by as I shouted my demands to be laid within the tomb; frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they could. A blackened circle on the floor of the ruined cellar told of a violent stroke from the heavens; and from this spot a group of curious villagers with lanterns were prying a small box of antique workmanship which the thunderbolt had brought to light. Ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing, I watched the spectators as they viewed the treasure-trove, and was permitted to share in their discoveries. The box, whose fastenings were broken by the stroke which had unearthed it, contained many papers and objects of value; but I had eyes for one thing alone.

Horror bulit upon horror as we started to understand the building remains. The four-legged creatureshad been held in stone pens. They must have broken out in their final madness from hunger or fear of rats. There had been herds of them. They were clearly fattened on rough palnts. The remains of these plants could be found like a poisonous fermented feed at the bottom of huge stone bins older than Rome. I now knew why my ancestors had such very gardens. I wish to heaven I could forget! I did not need to ask the purpose of the herds. Sir William, standing with his searchlight in the Roman ruin, read aloud the most shocking ritual I have ever konwn. He spoke of the eating habits of the cult that the priests of Cybele discovered. Mixed with their own. Norrys, though used to the trenches, could not walk straight when he left the English building. It was a butcher shop. Kitchenbut it was too mcuh to see familiar English tools in such a palce. It was too much to read familiar English graffiti there, some as recent as 1610. I could not enter that buildingan area. Horribly predicted by my repeating dream\u2014we turned to that seeminlgy endless midnight cave. No from the cliff could reach into it.\n###\nHorror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural remains. The quadruped things\u2014with their occasional recruits from the biped class\u2014had been kept in stone pens, out of which they must have broken in their last delirium of hunger or rat-fear. There had been great herds of them, evidently fattened on the coarse vegetables whose remains could be found as a sort of poisonous ensilage at the bottom of huge stone bins older than Rome. I knew now why my ancestors had had such excessive gardens\u2014would to heaven I could forget! The purpose of the herds I did not have to ask. Sir William, standing with his searchlight in the Roman ruin, translated aloud the most shocking ritual I have ever known; and told of the diet of the antediluvian cult which the priests of Cybele found and mingled with their own. Norrys, used as he was to the trenches, could not walk straight when he came out of the English building. It was a butcher shop and kitchen\u2014he had expected that\u2014but it was too much to see familiar English implements in such a place, and to read familiar English graffiti there, some as recent as 1610. I could not go in that building\u2014that building whose daemon activities were stopped only by the dagger of my ancestor Walter de la Poer. What I did venture to enter was the low Saxon building, whose oaken door had fallen, and there I found a terrible row of ten stone cells with rusty bars. Three had tenants, all skeletons of high grade, and on the bony forefinger of one I found a seal ring with my own coat-of-arms. Sir William found a vault with far older cells below the Roman chapel, but these cells were empty. Below them was a low crypt with cases of formally arranged bones, some of them bearing terrible parallel inscriptions carved in Latin, Greek, and the tongue of Phrygia. Meanwhile, Dr. Trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli, and brought to light skulls which were slightly more human than a gorilla\u2019s, and which bore indescribable ideographic carvings. Through all this horror my cat stalked unperturbed. Once I saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of bones, and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyes. Having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this twilit area\u2014an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dream\u2014we turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate."}

A hand bigger than a human hand had changed them. Silent they sat on top of the world like wolves or evil spirits. Clouds and mist crowned them. They guarded the secerts of the north forever. Tehy sat in a half cicrle. Those dog-like mountains were carved into huge watching statues. Their right hands were raised to threaten mankind. Only the moivng of the clouds made their double heads seme to move. But as Carter traveled on, he saw shapes rise from their laps. The motions of thees shapes were real. Winged and making a whirrign sound, those shapes grew bigger each mometn. The travelre knew his wandering was over. They were not any birds or bats known on earth or in dreamland. They were bigger than elephants. Tehy had heads like a horse's head. Carter knew they must be the shantak-birds from stories. He did not wonder anymore what evil guards. Nameless watchers kept men away from the northern rock desert. As he stopped and finally gave up, he dared to look behind him. There was the slant-eyed trader from evil stories. He was grinning and riding a ya.k He was leading a nasty crowd of smiling shantaks. Frost and salt from pits still stuck to their wings. Trapped though he was surrounded by unbelievable winged monsters with horse heads. They pressed around him in unholy circles. Randolph Carter did not faint. Lofty and those giant stone mnosters stood above him. The slant-eyed merchant jumped down from his yak. He stood grinning before the captured man. Then the man signaled Carter to get on one of the disgusting shantaks. He helped him up as his mind fought with his disgust. Climbing up was work. The shantak-bird has scales, not feathers. Those scales are very slippery. Once he was sitting, the slant-eyed man jumped up behind him. He left the yak to be led north by one of the huge bird monsters. The yak went toward the circle of carved mountains. Then came a spin through space. They went up and east for time. They went toward the grey sides of those impossible mountains. Leng was said to lie beyond those mountains. Far they flew above the clouds. Finally, the famous mountain tops lay below them. The people of Inganok haev never seen these tops. They always lie in spinning clouds of shining mist.\n###\nBut now those hills were hills no more, for some hand greater than man\u2019s had touched them. Silent they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls, crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever. All in a great half circle they squatted, those dog-like mountains carven into monstrous watching statues, and their right hands were raised in menace against mankind. It was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads seem to move, but as Carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy laps great forms whose motions were no delusion. Winged and whirring, those forms grew larger each moment, and the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end. They were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth or in dreamland, for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horse\u2019s. Carter knew that they must be the shantak-birds of ill rumour, and wondered no more what evil guardians and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert. And as he stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him; where indeed was trotting the squat slant-eyed trader of evil legend, grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether pits. Trapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that pressed around in great unholy circles, Randolph Carter did not lose consciousness. Lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered above him, while the slant-eyed merchant leaped down from his yak and stood grinning before the captive. Then the man motioned Carter to mount one of the repugnant shantaks, helping him up as his judgment struggled with his loathing. It was hard work ascending, for the shantak-bird has scales instead of feathers, and those scales are very slippery. Once he was seated, the slant-eyed man hopped up behind him, leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven mountains by one of the incredible bird colossi. There now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space, endlessly up and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which Leng was said to lie. Far above the clouds they flew, till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of Inganok have never seen, and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist."}

There was also a [THING]. It was not just cool, damp breeze. It was a strong, deliberate gust. It blew fiercely and coldly from that terrible opening. That was where the awful whistling came from. I remember jumping and stumbling over all kinds of obstacles. The rush of [THING] and the screaming sound grew stronger every moment. It seemed to curl and twist around me on purpose. It struck at me viciously from the spaces behind and below me. Even though the [THING] was at my back, it strangely slowed me down instead of helping me move forward. It felt like a rope or lasso had been thrown around me. Regardless of the noise I made, I scrambled over large [THING] of blocks. I was back in the passage that led to the surface. I remember seeing the archway to the [THING] [THING]. I almost shouted when I saw the slope going down. That slope led to where one of those horrible trap doors must be open, two levels below. But I did not shout. I kept repeating to myself that this was all a dream. I would wake up soon. Maybe I was in camp. Maybe I was at home in Arkham. These hopes helped keep my mind stable. I started to climb the slope to the higher level. I knew I had to cross the four - foot crack again. I was too shaken by other fears to understand the full terror until I was almost there. When I went down, jumping across was easy. But could I jump the gap as eaisly going uphill? I was hindered by fear, tirednses, the weight of the [THING] case. The strange backward pull of that demon [THING]. I thought of these things at the last moment. I also thouhgt of the unnamed beings that might be hiding in the black depths below the crack. My flickering flashlight was getting weak. But some vague memory told me when I was near the crack. The cold blasts of [THING]. The sickening whistling screams behind me were like a merciful drug for a moment. They numbed my imagination to the horror of the wide opening ahead. Then I became aware of more blasts and whistlign in front of me. Waves of horror surged up through the crack itself. They came from depths that can not be imagined. No,w the true essence of pure nightmare was on me. Sanity was gone. I ignored everything except the [THING] urge to run. I just fought and pushed upward over the rubble on the slope. I acted as if the deep crack did not exist.\n###\nThere was a wind, too\u2014not merely a cool, damp draught, but a violent, purposeful blast belching savagely and frigidly from that abominable gulf whence the obscene whistling came. There are memories of leaping and lurching over obstacles of every sort, with that torrent of wind and shrieking sound growing moment by moment, and seeming to curl and twist purposefully around me as it struck out wickedly from the spaces behind and beneath. Though in my rear, that wind had the odd effect of hindering instead of aiding my progress; as if it acted like a noose or lasso thrown around me. Heedless of the noise I made, I clattered over a great barrier of blocks and was again in the structure that led to the surface. I recall glimpsing the archway to the room of machines and almost crying out as I saw the incline leading down to where one of those blasphemous trap-doors must be yawning two levels below. But instead of crying out I muttered over and over to myself that this was all a dream from which I must soon awake. Perhaps I was in camp\u2014perhaps I was at home in Arkham. As these hopes bolstered up my sanity I began to mount the incline to the higher level. I knew, of course, that I had the four-foot cleft to re-cross, yet was too racked by other fears to realise the full horror until I came almost upon it. On my descent, the leap across had been easy\u2014but could I clear the gap as readily when going uphill, and hampered by fright, exhaustion, the weight of the metal case, and the anomalous backward tug of that daemon wind? I thought of these things at the last moment, and thought also of the nameless entities which might be lurking in the black abysses below the chasm. My wavering torch was growing feeble, but I could tell by some obscure memory when I neared the cleft. The chill blasts of wind and the nauseous whistling shrieks behind me were for the moment like a merciful opiate, dulling my imagination to the horror of the yawning gulf ahead. And then I became aware of the added blasts and whistling in front of me\u2014tides of abomination surging up through the cleft itself from depths unimagined and unimaginable. Now, indeed, the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity departed\u2014and ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline\u2019s debris as if no gulf had existed."}

Carter let his curiosity beta his fear. He moved forward again instead of going back. Once crossed an open street by crawling on his stomach lkie a worm. In another place, he had to stand up to avoid noise on piles of fallen marble. He always avoided being seen. Soon, he was behind a giant pillar. From three, he could watch the whole green-lit scene. Around a horrible fire made from bad lunar fungi stems, a stinking circle of toad-like moon-beasts. Their almost-human slaves squatted. Some slaves heated strange iron spears in the flames. They put the white-hot points on three tied-up prisoners lying before the leaders. From their tentacle motions, Carter saw the blunt-snouted moon-beasts loved the show. His horror grew when he recognized the frantic meepnig. The tortured ghouls were the faithful trio. They had guided him safely from the abyss. They had left the enchanted wood to find Sarkomand. The gate to their home deeps. Many malodorous moon-beasts were around that greenish fire. Carter saw he could not save his former allies now. He could not guess how the ghouls were captured. He thought the grey toadl-ike blasphemies heard them ask in Dylath-Leen about the way to Sarkomand. They did not want them near the hateful plateau of Leng and the indescribable high-priest. He thought about what to do. He remembered how close he was to the gate of the ghouls' black kingdom. Clearly decidde it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions. He would descend at once to the gulf. There he would meet no horrors worse thna those above. There he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren. They might wipe out the moon-beasts from the black galley. He thought the portal might be guarded by flocks of night-gaunts, like other gates to the abyss. But he did not fear these faceless creatures now.\n###\nIt was the frightened meeping of a ghoul, and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins, Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear, and crept forward again instead of retreating. Once in crossing an open street he wriggled worm-like on his stomach, and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen marble. But always he succeeded in avoiding discovery, so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar whence he could watch the whole green-litten scene of action. There, around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi, there squatted a stinking circle of the toad-like moon-beasts and their almost-human slaves. Some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames, and at intervals applying their white-hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of the party. From the motions of their tentacles Carter could see that the blunt-snouted moon-beasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely, and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find Sarkomand and the gate to their native deeps. The number of malodorous moon-beasts about that greenish fire was very great, and Carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies. Of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess; but fancied that the grey toad-like blasphemies had heard them inquire in Dylath-Leen concerning the way to Sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful plateau of Leng and the high-priest not to be described. For a moment he pondered on what he ought to do, and recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls\u2019 black kingdom. Clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once to the gulf, where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those above, and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moon-beasts from the black galley. It occurred to him that the portal, like other gates to the abyss, might be guarded by flocks of night-gaunts; but he did not fear these faceless creatures now."}

I cnanot read an Anacreontic without my mouth watering. It is for something much stronger than water!\" Several people who were listening looked up when the young man used a word they did not understand. The bank defaulter quietly explained to them that Anacreon was a cheerful old man who lived long ago. Wrote about the fun he had when the world was like Sheehan's place. Trever replied, \"Yes, but nothing like the old Teian! She is one of those boring moralizers who try to remove all joy from life. Have you heard of her? She writes under her maiden name Eleanor Wing.\" The young man's eyes shone. His nose wrinkled at the smell of the brown liquid an attendant porued for him. It disgusted him and offended his nautral good taste. His strong desire to experience life fully stayed with him. He kept a brave face. Before he could test his decision, something unexpected happened. Old Bugs, who had been crouching, suddnely stood up. He jumped at the young man and knocked the raised glass from his hands. At almost the same time, he attacked the tray of bottles. Glasses with his mop, scattering everything onto the floo.r The smell of alcohol mixed with broken glass and bottles. Some of the men. Things that had been men, dropped to floor. Began licking spilled liquor. But most remained still, watching the strange actions of the barroom cleaner and outcast. Old Bugs stood straight before the surprised Trever. Said in a calm, educated voice, \"Do not do this. I was like you once, and I did it. Now I am like this.\" \"This is the last time for you, old man!\" he shouted angrily. \"When a gentleman wants to drink here, by God, he will, without you interfering. Now get out of here before I kick you out.\" But Sheehan had not considered scientific knowledge of abnormal psychology. The effects of nervous excitement.

At the same time, he shouted various unconnected pieces of quotes, among which was porminently repeated, \" . . .\n###\n\u201cI want whiskey\u2014good old-fashioned rye!\u201d exclaimed Trever enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019m good and tired of water after reading of the merry bouts fellows used to have in the old days.

But the bank defaulter under cover explained to them that Anacreon was a gay old dog who lived many years ago and wrote about the fun he had when all the world was just like Sheehan\u2019s. \u201cYes, damn it,\u201d replied Trever, \u201cbut nothing like the old Teian! She\u2019s one of those dull, eternal moralisers that try to take all the joy out of life. Namby-pamby sort\u2014ever heard of her? She writes under her maiden name of Eleanor Wing.\u201d The youth\u2019s eyes glistened and his nostrils curled at the fumes of the brownish fluid which an attendant was pouring out for him. It repelled him horribly, and revolted all his inherited delicacy; but his determination to taste life to the full remained with him, and he maintained a bold front. But before his resolution was put to the test, the unexpected intervened. Old Bugs, springing up from the crouching position in which he had hitherto been, leaped at the youth and dashed from his hands the uplifted glass, almost simultaneously attacking the tray of bottles and glasses with his mop, and scattering the contents upon the floor in a confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles and tumblers. Numbers of men, or things which had been men, dropped to the floor and began lapping at the puddles of spilled liquor, but most remained immovable, watching the unprecedented actions of the barroom drudge and derelict. Old Bugs straightened up before the astonished Trever, and in a mild and cultivated voice said, \u201cDo not do this thing. I was like you once, and I did it. Now I am like\u2014this.\u201d \u201cThis is the last time for you, old bird!\u201d he exclaimed furiously. \u201cWhen a gen\u2019l\u2019man wants tuh take a drink here, by God, he shall, without you interferin\u2019.

I will not try to tell much about my life from 1908 to 1913. Readers can find all the basic facts from old newspapers. Science journals, as I mostly had to do. I was in control of my money. I spent it slowly and mostly wisely on travel and study at different schools. My travels, however, were very unusual. They involved long stays in faraway and empty places. In 1909, I spent a month in the Himalayas. In 1911, I got much attention by taking a camel trip into the unknown deserts of Arabia. I have never been able to learn what happened on those trips. In the summer of 1912, I hired a ship. Sailed in the Arctic north of Spitzbergen. After that, I showed signs of being disappointed. Later that year, I spent weeks alone in the huge limestone cave systems of western Virginia. These were beyond where anyone had explored before or after. The caves were black mazes. Complicated that I could not even think about finding my way back. My stays at universities were marked by very fast learning. It was as if the second personality had mind much smarter than my own. I also found that my speed of reading and studying alone was amazing. I could learn every detail of a [THING] just by looking over it as fast as I could turn the pages. My skill at understanding complex numbers instantly was truly impressive. At times, there were almost bad reports about my power to affect the thoughts. Actions of others. But I seemed to have tried to limit showing this ability. Other bad reports were about my closeness with leaders of occult groups. They also concerned scholars suspected of links to horrible secret groups of ancient priests. These rumors were never proven at the time. They were likely encouraged by the known nature of some of my reading. Looking at rare books in libraries can not be done in secret. There is solid proof in the form of notes in the margins. These show I carefully read things like the Comte d\u2019Erlette \u2019s Cultes des Goules, Ludvig Prinn \u2019s De Vermis Mysteriis, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, the remaining pieces of the confusing Book of Eibon. The feared Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazrde. Also, it is clear that a new. Evil wave of secret cult activity started around the time of my strange change.\n###\nI will not attempt to tell much of my life from 1908 to 1913, since readers may glean all the outward essentials\u2014as I largely had to do\u2014from files of old newspapers and scientific journals. I was given charge of my funds, and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely, in travel and in study at various centres of learning. My travels, however, were singular in the extreme; involving long visits to remote and desolate places. In 1909 I spent a month in the Himalayas, and in 1911 aroused much attention through a camel trip into the unknown deserts of Arabia. What happened on those journeys I have never been able to learn. During the summer of 1912 I chartered a ship and sailed in the Arctic north of Spitzbergen, afterward shewing signs of disappointment. Later in that year I spent weeks alone beyond the limits of previous or subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western Virginia\u2014black labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be considered. My sojourns at the universities were marked by abnormally rapid assimilation, as if the secondary personality had an intelligence enormously superior to my own. I have found, also, that my rate of reading and solitary study was phenomenal. I could master every detail of a book merely by glancing over it as fast as I could turn the leaves; while my skill at interpreting complex figures in an instant was veritably awesome. At times there appeared almost ugly reports of my power to influence the thoughts and acts of others, though I seemed to have taken care to minimise displays of this faculty. Other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups, and scholars suspected of connexion with nameless bands of abhorrent elder-world hierophants. These rumours, though never proved at the time, were doubtless stimulated by the known tenor of some of my reading\u2014for the consultation of rare books at libraries cannot be effected secretly. There is tangible proof\u2014in the form of marginal notes\u2014that I went minutely through such things as the Comte d\u2019Erlette\u2019s Cultes des Goules, Ludvig Prinn\u2019s De Vermis Mysteriis, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, the surviving fragments of the puzzling Book of Eibon, and the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred.

Then the old man made a signal to the half-seen flute-player in the darkness, which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected. At this horror I sank nearly to the lichened earth, transfixed with a dread not of this nor any world, but only of the mad spaces between the stars. Out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold flame, out of the Tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled uncanny, unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped rhythmically a horde of tame, trained, hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly grasp, or sound brain ever wholly remember. They were not altogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human beings; but something I cannot and must not recall. They flopped limply along, half with their webbed feet and half with their membraneous wings; and as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them, and rode off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted river, into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataracts. The old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man remained only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet that the amorphous flute-player had rolled out of sight, but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by.

Just at the time when a wave of kidnappings and disappearances spread its excitement over New York, the unkempt scholar embarked upon a metamorphosis as startling as it was absurd. One day he was seen near Borough Hall with clean-shaved face, well-trimmed hair, and tastefully immaculate attire, and on every day thereafter some obscure improvement was noticed in him. He maintained his new fastidiousness without interruption, added to it an unwonted sparkle of eye and crispness of speech, and began little by little to shed the corpulence which had so long deformed him. Now frequently taken for less than his age, he acquired an elasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanour to match the new tradition, and shewed a curious darkening of the hair which somehow did not suggest dye. As the months passed, he commenced to dress less and less conservatively, and finally astonished his new friends by renovating and redecorating his Flatbush mansion, which he threw open in a series of receptions, summoning all the acquaintances he could remember, and extending a special welcome to the fully forgiven relatives who had so lately sought his restraint. Some attended through curiosity, others through duty; but all were suddenly charmed by the dawning grace and urbanity of the former hermit. He had, he asserted, accomplished most of his allotted work; and having just inherited some property from a half-forgotten European friend, was about to spend his remaining years in a brighter second youth which ease, care, and diet had made possible to him. Less and less was he seen at Red Hook, and more and more did he move in the society to which he was born. Policemen noted a tendency of the gangsters to congregate at the old stone church and dance-hall instead of at the basement flat in Parker Place, though the latter and its recent annexes still overflowed with noxious life. Then two incidents occurred\u2014wide enough apart, but both of intense interest in the case as Malone envisaged it. One was a quiet announcement in the Eagle of Robert Suydam\u2019s engagement to Miss Cornelia Gerritsen of Bayside, a young woman of excellent position, and distantly related to the elderly bridegroom-elect; whilst the other was a raid on the dance-hall church by city police, after a report that the face of a kidnapped child had been seen for a second at one of the basement windows."}

These were fates that should not be present isnide the lands of the Roman People. Allowing wild parties of the sort known to happen at Sabbaths would hardly match the traditions of those whsoe ancestors, when A. Postumius was consul, had put to death so many Roman citizens for practicing the Bacchanalia. This event is always remembered by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, carved on bronze. Displayed for all to see. Checked in time, before the advancement of the rituals might call forth something that the iron of a Roman spear might not handle, the Sabbath would not be beyond the abilities of one cohort. Only those taking patr needed to be arrested. Sparing many mere onlookers would greatly reduce the anger any supportive local people might feel. In brief, both morality and practical strategy required firm action. I did not doubt that Publius Scribonius, remembering the respect. Duties of the Roman People, would stick to his plan of sending the cohort, with me along, despite any objections that Balbutius. Asellius might choose to raise. They spoke more like provincial people than Romans. The low sun was now very near setting. The wohle quiet town seemed covered in strange and evil spell. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul showed he agreed with my words. He placed me with the cohort in the temporary role of a leading centurion. Balbutius and Asellius agreed, the former more willingly than the latter. As evening came on the wild autumn hillsides, a regular, awful beating of odd drums came from far away in a frightening rhythm. A few of the soldiers showed fear, but sharp orders got them into formation. Soon the whole cohort was arranged on the open flatland east of the racetrack. Libo himself, and also Balbutius, insisted on going with the cohort. We had much trouble finding a local guide to show the paths up the mountai.n Finally a young man named Vercellius, the son of purely Roman parents, agreed to lead us at least past the lower hills. We started to march in the growing dark. The thin silver curve of a new moon shook above the woods on our left.\n###\nThere were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia\u2014a matter kept ever in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set open to every eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort. Only participants need be apprehended, and the sparing of a great number of mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment which any of the sympathising country folk might feel. In short, both principle and policy demanded stern action; and I could not doubt but that Publius Scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the Roman People, would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as Balbutius and Asellius\u2014speaking indeed more like provincials than Romans\u2014might see fit to offer and multiply. The slanting sun was now very low, and the whole hushed town seemed draped in an unreal and malign glamour. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul signified his approval of my words, and stationed me with the cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus; Balbutius and Asellius assenting, the former with better grace than the latter. As twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes, a measured, hideous beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible rhythm. Some few of the legionarii shewed timidity, but sharp commands brought them into line, and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open plain east of the circus. Libo himself, as well as Balbutius, insisted on accompanying the cohort; but great difficulty was suffered in getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain. Finally a young man named Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to take us at least past the foothills. We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a young moon trembling over the woods on our left."}

Each day, the sun moved in the sky. The mists grew. After two weeks, there was no sunlight. There was a twilight during the day. It shone through a dome of cloud. At night, there was a, starless glow from the underside of that cloud. On the day, they saw a, rock in the sea from. It was the land seen since Aran 's peak had disappeared behind the ship. Carter asked the captain the rock 's name. captain said it had no name. He said no ship had gone near it because of the sounds from it at night. After, a, howling came from that granite place. The traveler was they did not stop. He was the rock had no name. The sailors prayed and chanted until the noise could not be heard. Carter had dreams within dreams at night. Two mornings, a line of peaks appeared to the east. Their tops were lost in the clouds of that twilight wordl. When the sailors saw them, they sang songs. Some knelt on the deck to pray. Carter knew they had reached the land of Inganok. They would dock at the basalt quays of the town with that land 's name. At Toward noon, a coastlnie appeared.

And in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all, but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day, and a cold starless phosphorescence from the under side of that cloud by night. On the twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was sighted from afar, the first land glimpsed since Aran\u2019s snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship. Carter asked the captain the name of that rock, but was told that it had no name and had never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night. And when, after dark, a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite place, the traveller was glad that no stop had been made, and that the rock had no name. The seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of earshot, and Carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small hours. Two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world. And at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs, and some knelt down on the deck to pray; so that Carter knew they were come to the land of Inganok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that land\u2019s name. Toward noon a dark coast-line appeared, and before three o\u2019clock there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city. Rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays, all of delicate black with scrolls, flutings, and arabesques of inlaid gold. Tall and many-windowed were the houses, and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant than light. Some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point, others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination. The walls were low, and pierced by frequent gates, each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant Ngranek."}

The moon streamed down on the shape outlined. West did a thing. Despite the danger of attracting attention. Bringing a police investigation on our friend,. fired all six shots from his revolver into the night visitor. That visitor was neither nor a policeman. Standing against the moon was a, thing not to be imagined except in nightmares. It was a glassy - eyed, ink - figure on all fours. It was covered with bits of mold, leaves, and vines. It was with dried blood. Between its shining teeth was a snow -,, tube - shaped object ending in a hand. The scream of a man gave me that and added horror of Dr. Herbert West which troubled the years of our partnership. It is that such a thing as a man 's scream should cause horror, for it is not a pleasant. But I was used to experiences. I suffered on this occasion because of a situation. As I have suggested, it was not of the man himself that I became. Herbert West, whose partner. Assistant I was, had interests beyond the routine of a village doctor. That was why, when starting his practice in Bolton, he had chosen an house near the potter 's field. Brutally stated, Wets 's interest was a study of the phenomena of life. This led toward bringing the to life through injections of an solution. For this experimenting, it was to have a supply of bodies. They needed to be because the decay damaged the brain structure. They needed to be because we found the solution had to be made for types of organisms. Scores of rabbits. Guinea pigs had been killed. Their path was a end. West had succeeded because he had been to get a corpse. What he wanted were bodies from wihch life had. He wanted bodies with every cell whole. of receiving the impulse toward that kind of motion called life.\n###\nWhen we reached the door I cautiously unbolted it and threw it open, and as the moon streamed revealingly down on the form silhouetted there, West did a peculiar thing. Despite the obvious danger of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police investigation\u2014a thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative isolation of our cottage\u2014my friend suddenly, excitedly, and unnecessarily emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitor. For that visitor was neither Italian nor policeman. Looming hideously against the spectral moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in nightmares\u2014a glassy-eyed, ink-black apparition nearly on all fours, covered with bits of mould, leaves, and vines, foul with caked blood, and having between its glistening teeth a snow-white, terrible, cylindrical object terminating in a tiny hand. The scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of Dr. Herbert West which harassed the latter years of our companionship. It is natural that such a thing as a dead man\u2019s scream should give horror, for it is obviously not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence; but I was used to similar experiences, hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance. And, as I have implied, it was not of the dead man himself that I became afraid. Herbert West, whose associate and assistant I was, possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician. That was why, when establishing his practice in Bolton, he had chosen an isolated house near the potter\u2019s field. Briefly and brutally stated, West\u2019s sole absorbing interest was a secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation, leading toward the reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution. For this ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh human bodies; very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the brain structure, and human because we found that the solution had to be compounded differently for different types of organisms. Scores of rabbits and guinea-pigs had been killed and treated, but their trail was a blind one. West had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse sufficiently fresh. What he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just departed; bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the impulse toward that mode of motion called life."}

He played with ideas of the. The as a cure for the. of these,, showed their lack of value and emptiness. He saw that the teachings of knowledge are. Ubnending as those of science. Yet they do not have the relief of truth to save them. foolishness, lies, and thinking are not dream. They form no escape from life for a mnid trained above their level. Carter bought books. He searched for and men of learning. He dug into knolwedge of the mind that have walkde. He learned things about the holes of life, legend, and times past memory. These things troubled him. He decided to live on a level. He furnished his Boston home to match his changing moods. He had one room for each mood. They were hung in cloors. They were furnished with books and objects. They were provided with sources of the feelings of, heat, sound, taste. Once he heard of a man in the South. This man was avoided. Feared for the things he read in books. Clay tablets smuggled from India. Him he visited this man. He lived with him and shared his studies for seven years. Horror caught them one midnight in an and burial ground. one came out where two had gone. he went to Arkham. This was the, witch - haunted town of his ancestors in New England. He had experiences in the dark, among the willow trees. roofs with two slopes. These made him seal pages in the diary of an ancestor with a mind. But these horrors took him to the edge of reality. They weer not of the dream country he had known in youth. At fifty years, he lost hope of any rest. Satisfaction in a world grown for beauty. for dream. Having understood at the emptiness and uselessness of things. Carter spent his days in withdrawal. He spent them in, memories of his youth filled with dreams. He thought it that he bothered to keep on living. He got from a acquaintance a liquid to take him to forgetfulness without pain. Inertia and the power of habit,, made him put off action. He waited among thoughts of times. He took down the wall coverings from his walls. He fixed the house as it was in his boyhood. It had windowpanes, furniture, and everything.\n###\nIt was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion, and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace. Most of these, however, soon shewed their poverty and barrenness; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as dry and inflexible as those of science, yet without even the slender palliative of truth to redeem them. Gross stupidity, falsehood, and muddled thinking are not dream; and form no escape from life to a mind trained above their level. So Carter bought stranger books and sought out deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition; delving into arcana of consciousness that few have trod, and learning things about the secret pits of life, legend, and immemorial antiquity which disturbed him ever afterward. He decided to live on a rarer plane, and furnished his Boston home to suit his changing moods; one room for each, hung in appropriate colours, furnished with befitting books and objects, and provided with sources of the proper sensations of light, heat, sound, taste, and odour. Once he heard of a man in the South who was shunned and feared for the blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets smuggled from India and Arabia. Him he visited, living with him and sharing his studies for seven years, till horror overtook them one midnight in an unknown and archaic graveyard, and only one emerged where two had entered. Then he went back to Arkham, the terrible witch-haunted old town of his forefathers in New England, and had experiences in the dark, amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel roofs, which made him seal forever certain pages in the diary of a wild-minded ancestor. But these horrors took him only to the edge of reality, and were not of the true dream country he had known in youth; so that at fifty he despaired of any rest or contentment in a world grown too busy for beauty and too shrewd for dream. Having perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real things, Carter spent his days in retirement, and in wistful disjointed memories of his dream-filled youth. He thought it rather silly that he bothered to keep on living at all, and got from a South American acquaintance a very curious liquid to take him to oblivion without suffering. Inertia and force of habit, however, caused him to defer action; and he lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times, taking down the strange hangings from his walls and refitting the house as it was in his early boyhood\u2014purple panes, Victorian furniture, and all."}

Tehy broke down door. They found thee two of us unconscious on the blood-stained ccarpet. We were beaaten, scratched, and badly hrut. The broken pieces of West's bottles and tools were around us. Only an oepn window showed what happened to our attacker. Many people wondered how he survived the terrible jump from the second floor to the lawn. There were some odd clothes in the room. But West, after waking up, said they did not belong to the stranger. He said tthey were samples gathered for germ study during research on spreading sickness. He ordered them burned right away in the large fireplace. To the police, we both said we did not know ouur recent companion's name. He wsa, West said nervously, a frinedly stranger we met at some downtown ba.r We were not sure of bars' location. We had all been quite cheerful. West and I did not want ourr aggressive companion to be chased.\n###\nApparently this acidulous matron was right; for about 3 a.m. the whole house was aroused by cries coming from West\u2019s room, where when they broke down the door they found the two of us unconscious on the blood-stained carpet, beaten, scratched, and mauled, and with the broken remnants of West\u2019s bottles and instruments around us. Only an open window told what had become of our assailant, and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made. There were some strange garments in the room, but West upon regaining consciousness said they did not belong to the stranger, but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases. He ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace. To the police we both declared ignorance of our late companion\u2019s identity. He was, West nervously said, a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar of uncertain location. We had all been rather jovial, and West and I did not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted down."}

It triggered a memory that excited and disturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific detail. He studied the bas-relief with frantic intensity. The youth had been working on it. He was chilled and in his night clothes when he woke up confused. My uncle blamed his old age. Wilcox later said he was slow to recognize the hieroglyphics and pictures. Many qeustions seemed very out of place to the visitor. This was especially true for questions linking him to strange cults or societies. Wilcox could not understand thhe repeated promises of silence. These were offered if he admitted being in a mystical or pagan religious group. When Professor Angell became sure the sculptor knew nothing of any cult or secret knowledge. He then pressed his visitor foor future dream reports. This had regular results. After the first meeting, the manuscript notes daily visits from the young man. he told of startling pieces of night imagery. The main theme was always a terrible Cyclopean view of dark, dripping stone. An underground voice or mind shouted monotonously. These sense-ipmacts were puzzling AND could only be written as nonsense. The two mots repeated sounds are written as \"Cthulhu\" and \"R'lyeh\".\n###\nThis verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed Professor Angell. He questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness; and studied with almost frantic intensity the bas-relief on which the youth had found himself working, chilled and clad only in his night-clothes, when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him. My uncle blamed his old age, Wilcox afterward said, for his slowness in recognising both hieroglyphics and pictorial design. Many of his questions seemed highly out-of-place to his visitor, especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies; and Wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body. When Professor Angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore, he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams. This bore regular fruit, for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man, during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imagery whose burden was always some terrible Cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone, with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish.

And I have had these 150 years more than you to consult these Matters in. But if Willett and Mr. Ward did not show this letter to the mental doctors, they did not hold bakc from acting on it themselves. No amount of clever arguing could change the fact that the strangely bearded. Allen, of whom Charles's wild letter had spoken as such a huge threat, was in close. Evil contact with two beings whom Ward had visited in his travels. Who clearly said they weer survivors. Forms of Cruwen's Salem coworkers. That he saw himself as the rebirth of Joseph Curwen. That he hadmurderous plans against a \"boy\" who could hardly be other than Charles Ward. There was organized horror going on. No matter who had started it, the missing Allne was by this time involved in it. So, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in hospital, Mr. Ward qucikly hired detectives to leran all they could about the mysterious bearded dotcor. Finding where he had come from. What Pawtuxet knew of him. If possible finding out where he was now. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which Charles gave up, he urged them to search Allen's room which had been identified when the patient's things were packed. Getting what clues they could from any items he might have left around. Mr. Ward talked with the deetctives in his son's library. They felt a clear relief when they left it at last. For there seemed to hang about the place a faint sense of evil. Maybe it was what they had heard of the infamous wizard whose picture had once looked out from the paneled mantel. Maybe it was something different. In any case they all partly felt unseen badness which centered in that carved leftover of an older home. Which at times almost rose to strength of a physical presence. Now quickly came that experience which has left its permanent mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett. Has added ten years to the visible age of one whose youth was even then past. Dr. Willett had talked at length with Mr. Had reached an agreement with him on several points which both felt the mental doctors would laugh at.\n###\nHave Confidence in what I saye, for you knowe O. and I have hadd these 150 yeares more than you to consulte these Matters in. But if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charles\u2019s frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of Curwen\u2019s old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained\u2014or was at least advised to entertain\u2014murderous designs against a \u201cboy\u201d who could scarcely be other than Charles Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had started it, the missing Allen was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor; finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible discovering his current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which Charles yielded up, he urged them to explore Allen\u2019s vacant room which had been identified when the patient\u2019s belongings had been packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his son\u2019s old library, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation. And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule."}

I was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of New England\u2014sightseeing, antiquarian, and genealogical\u2014and had planned to go directly from ancient Newburyport to Arkham, whence my mother\u2019s family was derived. I had no car, but was travelling by train, trolley, and motor-coach, always seeking the cheapest possible route. In Newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to take to Arkham; and it was only at the station ticket-office, when I demurred at the high fare, that I learned about Innsmouth. The stout, shrewd-faced agent, whose speech shewed him to be no local man, seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy, and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered. \u201cYou could take that old bus, I suppose,\u201d he said with a certain hesitation, \u201cbut it ain\u2019t thought much of hereabouts. It goes through Innsmouth\u2014you may have heard about that\u2014and so the people don\u2019t like it. Run by an Innsmouth fellow\u2014Joe Sargent\u2014but never gets any custom from here, or Arkham either, I guess. Wonder it keeps running at all.

Any reference to a town not shewn on common maps or listed in recent guide-books would have interested me, and the agent\u2019s odd manner of allusion roused something like real curiosity. A town able to inspire such dislike in its neighbours, I thought, must be at least rather unusual, and worthy of a tourist\u2019s attention. If it came before Arkham I would stop off there\u2014and so I asked the agent to tell me something about it. He was very deliberate, and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said. \u201cInnsmouth? Well, it\u2019s a queer kind of a town down at the mouth of the Manuxet.

The constant direction through the seasons was from the orchard to the greenhouse. This movement was helped by the appearance of new plant types, though the old-fashioned varieties were never completely given up. Another reason for the move toward greenhouses was the new trouble in growing. Handling the tomatoes needed for successful summer salads. As the years passed, as the grocery store workers sadly admitted, the skill of choosnig perfect fruit frmo the common bins had been lost. So the shoppers had to rely on the pre-packaged forms already available. In the cold aisles, the leafy greens proved very easy to manage. The tomatoes on the vine, ripening unpredictably.

I put my torch in my pocket. I struggled with a strength I did not think I had. I pulled aside first one giant piece of [THING] and then another. A strong draft welled up. Its dampness felt oddly different from the desert 's dry air. A black crack began to open wide. At last, when I had pushed away every piece small enough to move, the sickly moonlight shone on an opening wide enough for me to enter. I took out my torch and shone a bright beam into the opening. Below me was a mess of fallen masonry. It sloped roughly down toward the north at about forty - five degrees. It was clearly the result of some past collapse from above. Between its surface and the ground level was a hole of unseeable blackness. At its upper edge were signs of huge, stress - bent arched stonework. At this point, it seemed, the desert 's sand lay directly on a [THING] of some giant structure from earth 's youth. How it was preserved through ages of geological upheaval, I could not then. Can not now even try to guess. Looking back, the very idea of a sudden, lone climb down into such a doubtful deep hole seems like the highest point of madness. My location was unknown to any living [THING]. Perhaps it was madness. Yet that night I started such a climb down without hesitation. Again there was clearly that pull and drive of fate. It had all along seemed to guide my path. With my torch flashing now. Then to save the battrey, I began a wild scramble down the sinister, Cyclopean slope below the opening. Sometimes I faced forward when I found good [THING] and [THING] holds. Other times I turned to face the heap of large stones as I held on. Felt my way more uncertainly. In two directions beside me, distant walls of carved, crumbling masonry appeared dimly under the direct beams of my torch. Ahead, however, was only unbroken blackness. I did not keep track of time during my downward scramble. My mind was. Full of confusing hints. Images that all real things seemed pulled back into huge distances. Physical feeling was dead. Even fear remained like a ghostly, still [THING] [THING] grinning weakly at me. Eventually I reached a level [THING]. It was covered with fallen blocks, shapeless [THING] pieces. Debris of every kind. On either side, perhaps thirty feet apart, rose huge walls ending in large arched supports. I could just see that they were carved. But the nature of the carvings was beyond my seeing.\n###\nPocketing my torch, and struggling with a strength that I had not thought I possessed, I wrenched aside first one titan fragment of stone and then another, till there welled up a strong draught whose dampness contrasted oddly with the desert\u2019s dry air. A black rift began to yawn, and at length\u2014when I had pushed away every fragment small enough to budge\u2014the leprous moonlight blazed on an aperture of ample width to admit me. I drew out my torch and cast a brilliant beam into the opening. Below me was a chaos of tumbled masonry, sloping roughly down toward the north at an angle of about forty-five degrees, and evidently the result of some bygone collapse from above. Between its surface and the ground level was a gulf of impenetrable blackness at whose upper edge were signs of gigantic, stress-heaved vaulting. At this point, it appeared, the desert\u2019s sands lay directly upon a floor of some titan structure of earth\u2019s youth\u2014how preserved through aeons of geologic convulsion I could not then and cannot now even attempt to guess. In retrospect, the barest idea of a sudden, lone descent into such a doubtful abyss\u2014and at a time when one\u2019s whereabouts were unknown to any living soul\u2014seems like the utter apex of insanity. Perhaps it was\u2014yet that night I embarked without hesitancy upon such a descent. Again there was manifest that lure and driving of fatality which had all along seemed to direct my course. With torch flashing intermittently to save the battery, I commenced a mad scramble down the sinister, Cyclopean incline below the opening\u2014sometimes facing forward as I found good hand and foot holds, and at other times turning to face the heap of megaliths as I clung and fumbled more precariously. In two directions beside me, distant walls of carven, crumbling masonry loomed dimly under the direct beams of my torch. Ahead, however, was only unbroken blackness. I kept no track of time during my downward scramble. So seething with baffling hints and images was my mind, that all objective matters seemed withdrawn into incalculable distances. Physical sensation was dead, and even fear remained as a wraith-like, inactive gargoyle leering impotently at me. Eventually I reached a level floor strown with fallen blocks, shapeless fragments of stone, and sand and detritus of every kind. On either side\u2014perhaps thirty feet apart\u2014rose massive walls culminating in huge groinings. That they were carved I could just discern, but the nature of the carvings was beyond my perception."}

For some time, the odd angles of Gilman\u2019s room had clearly been affecting him in a strange, nearly hypnotic way. As the cold winetr continued, he found himself staring more. More at the corner where the downward-sloping ceiling met the inward-sloping wall. Around this time, his trouble focusing on his reegular studies worried him a lot. His fears about the mid-year exams were very strong. But his overly sharp hearing was almost as bothersome. Life had become a persistent and nearly unbearable noise. There was also that constant, frightening feeling of other sounds. These sounds perhaps came from places beyond life. They trembled right at the edge of being heard. For actual noises, the rats in the old walls were the worst. Sometimes their scratching seemed NOT only secret but intentional. When it cmae from behind the sloping north wall,, it was mixed with a kind of dry rattling. When it came from the loft above the sloping ceiling, closed for a century, Gilman always stiffened. HE actde as if expecting some horror that was only waiting for its time to come down. Completely swallow him.\n###\nThe touch of brain-fever and the dreams began early in February. For some time, apparently, the curious angles of Gilman\u2019s room had been having a strange, almost hypnotic effect on him; and as the bleak winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at the corner where the down-slanting ceiling met the inward-slanting wall. About this period his inability to concentrate on his formal studies worried him considerably, his apprehensions about the mid-year examinations being very acute. But the exaggerated sense of hearing was scarcely less annoying. Life had become an insistent and almost unendurable cacophony, and there was that constant, terrifying impression of other sounds\u2014perhaps from regions beyond life\u2014trembling on the very brink of audibility. So far as concrete noises went, the rats in the ancient partitions were the worst. Sometimes their scratching seemed not only furtive but deliberate. When it came from beyond the slanting north wall it was mixed with a sort of dry rattling\u2014and when it came from the century-closed loft above the slanting ceiling Gilman always braced himself as if expecting some horror which only bided its time before descending to engulf him utterly."}

Connected all this evidence still hold onto less reasonable. They tend to believe much of Blake's diary as it is written. They importantly noet certain facts. These include the proven authenticity of the old church record. Thhey include the confirmed existence of the disliked and unorthodox Starry Wisdom group before 1877. They include documented disappearance of a curious reporter named Edwin M. Lillibridge in 1893. Most importantly, they include the look of horrible, transforming fear on the young writer's face when he died. One of these believres was moved to extreme actions. He threw a strangely shaped stone and its oddly decortaed metal box into the bay. These were found in the old church steeple. This was the black steeple without windows, not the tower where Blake's diary first said they were. This man was widely criticized by officials and others. He was a respected doctor with an interest in strange folklore. He stated that he had removed something from the earth. He said it was too dangerous to remain on it.\n###\nAmong those, however, who have examined and correlated all this evidence, there remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories.

This huge, [THING] - protected [THING] held the records of the whole solar system. It was built with amaznig skill. Strength to last as long as the system itself. Blocks of huge size were plaecd with mathematical genius. They were joined with incredibly strong cement. Together they formed a mass as solid as the rocyk center of the planet. Here, after amounts of time greater than I could sanely understand, its buried shape stood with all its main outlines. The huge, dust - covered floors were barely sprinkled with the scattered mess that was. The fairly easy walking from this point on strangely affected my mind. All the frantic eagerness that had been blocked by obstacles before now came out as a kind of feverish speed. I literally ran along the low - roofed, terribly familiar walkways beyond the archway. I was no longer surprised by how familiar everything I saw was. On every sied, the great [THING] shelf doors with picture writing towered hugely. Some were still closed. Others had sprung open. Still othres were bent and crushed by past [THING] movements. Those movements were not quite strong enough to break the giant stonework. There, a dust - covered pile below an empty, open shelf seemed to show where boxes had been shaken down by earthquakes. On some pillars were large symbols or letters announcing groups and sub - groups of books. Once I stopped before an open storage [THING]. I saw some of the usual [THING] boxes still in place among the ever - present gritty dust. Reaching up, I moved one of the thinner boxes with some trouble. I put it on the [THING] to look at it. Its title was in the common curved picture writing. But something about the arrangement of the characters seemed a little odd. The strange mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly known to me. I snapped open the still rust - free and working lid. I pulled out the [THING] inside. The [THING], as I expected, was about twenty by fifteen inches in szie. Two inches thick. The thin [THING] covers opened at the top. Its tough cellulose pages seemed untouched by the countless cycles of time they had lived through. I studied the strangely colored, brush - drawn letters of the text. The symbols were completely unlike the usual curved picture writing. Any alphabet known to human learning. I felt a haunting, half - awakened memory.\n###\nThat I could find a clear passage up and down the incline to all the surviving levels, I had oddly little doubt. This vast, earth-protected pile, housing the annals of all the solar system, had been built with supernal skill and strength to last as long as that system itself. Blocks of stupendous size, poised with mathematical genius and bound with cements of incredible toughness, had combined to form a mass as firm as the planet\u2019s rocky core. Here, after ages more prodigious than I could sanely grasp, its buried bulk stood in all its essential contours; the vast, dust-drifted floors scarce sprinkled with the litter elsewhere so dominant. The relatively easy walking from this point onward went curiously to my head. All the frantic eagerness hitherto frustrated by obstacles now took itself out in a kind of febrile speed, and I literally raced along the low-roofed, monstrously well-remembered aisles beyond the archway. I was past being astonished by the familiarity of what I saw. On every hand the great hieroglyphed metal shelf-doors loomed monstrously; some yet in place, others sprung open, and still others bent and buckled under bygone geological stresses not quite strong enough to shatter the titan masonry. Here and there a dust-covered heap below a gaping empty shelf seemed to indicate where cases had been shaken down by earth-tremors. On occasional pillars were great symbols or letters proclaiming classes and sub-classes of volumes. Once I paused before an open vault where I saw some of the accustomed metal cases still in position amidst the omnipresent gritty dust. Reaching up, I dislodged one of the thinner specimens with some difficulty, and rested it on the floor for inspection. It was titled in the prevailing curvilinear hieroglyphs, though something in the arrangement of the characters seemed subtly unusual. The odd mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly well known to me, and I snapped up the still rustless and workable lid and drew out the book within. The latter, as expected, was some twenty by fifteen inches in area, and two inches thick; the thin metal covers opening at the top. Its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they had lived through, and I studied the queerly pigmented, brush-drawn letters of the text\u2014symbols utterly unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet known to human scholarship\u2014with a haunting, half-aroused memory."}

But the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its space, kept from blowing by the lack of wind in this cave, lay a amount of a, - greenish powdery crust. This must have been in the jug. Willett fell over from the meanings that rushed over him. He connected bit by bit the parts and events of the scene. The torture tools, the dust.

Their words were as to be known to one who had read Curwen material. Dug into history. One the doctor knew as what Mrs. Ward heard her son saying on that Good Friday a year. An expert had told him it was a call to gods outside realms. It was not written as Mrs. Ward had written it from memory. Nor was it as the expert had shown him in the pages of \" Eliphas Levi \". But its sameness was. Words like Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fear through the. He had seen and felt of evil. This was on the - hand wall as one entered the room.

Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of \u201cMateria\u201d, the two lekythoi from the \u201cCustodes\u201d shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward\u2014all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor. With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwen\u2019s time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \u201cEliphas Levi\u201d; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner. This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \u201cDragon\u2019s Head\u201d and \u201cDragon\u2019s Tail\u201d heading them as in Ward\u2019s scribblings."}

We had found certain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have prepared us, yet the effect of the sight down there in the pre-human vaults of a nightmare city was almost too much to bear. A mad Gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found on the greenish soapstones, just as the dots on those insane five-pointed grave-mounds might have been made; and he might conceivably have prepared rough, hasty sketches\u2014varying in their accuracy or lack of it\u2014which outlined the neighbouring parts of the city and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside our previous route\u2014a place we identified as a great cylindrical tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our a\u00ebrial survey\u2014to the present five-pointed structure and the tunnel-mouth therein. He might, I repeat, have prepared such sketches; for those before us were quite obviously compiled as our own had been from late sculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth, though not from the ones which we had seen and used. But what this art-blind bungler could never have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured technique perhaps superior, despite haste and carelessness, to any of the decadent carvings from which they were taken\u2014the characteristic and unmistakable technique of the Old Ones themselves in the dead city\u2019s heyday. There are those who will say Danforth and I were utterly mad not to flee for our lives after that; since our conclusions were now\u2014notwithstanding their wildness\u2014completely fixed, and of a nature I need not even mention to those who have read my account as far as this. Perhaps we were mad\u2014for have I not said those horrible peaks were mountains of madness? But I think I can detect something of the same spirit\u2014albeit in a less extreme form\u2014in the men who stalk deadly beasts through African jungles to photograph them or study their habits. Half-paralysed with terror though we were, there was nevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the end. Of course we did not mean to face that\u2014or those\u2014which we knew had been there, but we felt that they must be gone by now.

Vegetation was getting weaker. The terrible winter snows no lonegr melted fulyl, even in summer. The reptile livestock were almost all dead. The mammals weer not handling it well either. To continue the work of the upper world, it became needed to adjust some shapeless. Oddly cold-resistant shoggoths for land life. The Old Ones had been unwilling to do this before. The great river was now empty of life. The upper sea had lost most of its creatures except for seals and whales. All the birds had flown away, except for the large, strange penguins. What happened next we could only guess. How long did the new sea-cavern city last? Was it still down there, a stone body in endless darkness? Had underground waters finally frozen? What fate came to the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world? Had any of the Aged Ones moved north ahead of the spreading ice sheet? Existing geology shows no sign of them. Had the awful Mi-Go still a threat in the outer land world of the north? Could one be sure of what might. Might not remain even now in the dark. Unmeasured depths of earth's deepest waters? Those things seemed able to handle any amount of pressure. Men of the sea have caught strange objects at times. Does the killer-whale theory truly explain the violent. Odd scars on antarctic seals seen a generation ago by Borchgrevingk? The specimens found by poor Lake were not part of these guesses. Their geologic setting showed they lived at a very early time in the land city's history. Based on their lcoation, they were surely at least thitry million years old. We thought that in their day, the sea-cavern city. The cvaern itself, did not exist. They would recall an older view. Lush Tertiary plants weer everywhere. A younger land city with thriving arts was around them. A great river floewd north along the mighyt mountains toward a far-off tropical ocean. Still, we could not stop thinking about these specimens. We thought especially about the eight perfect ones missing from Lak'es badly destroyed camp.\n###\nBy this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognised, for the sculptures shewed many signs of the cold\u2019s malign encroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer. The saurian livestock were nearly all dead, and the mammals were standing it none too well. To keep on with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously cold-resistant shoggoths to land life; a thing the Old Ones had formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless, and the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales. All the birds had flown away, save only the great, grotesque penguins. What had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new sea-cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in eternal blackness? Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what fate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered? Had any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice-cap? Existing geology shews no trace of their presence. Had the frightful Mi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? Could one be sure of what might or might not linger even to this day in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth\u2019s deepest waters? Those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure\u2014and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at times. And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by Borchgrevingk? The specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for their geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land city\u2019s history. They were, according to their location, certainly not less than thirty million years old; and we reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself, had no existence. They would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary vegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around them, and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a far-away tropic ocean. And yet we could not help thinking about these specimens\u2014especially about the eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake\u2019s hideously ravaged camp."}

The Roulets, it seemed, had come in 1696 from East Greenwich, down the west shore of Narragasnett Bay. They were Huguenots from Caude. They had met opposition before the Providence town leaders allowed them to settle in the town. Unpopularity had followed them in East Greenwich. They had come in 1686, after the taking of the Edict of Nantes. Rumor said the reason for the dislike went beyond race and prejudice. It went beyond the land arguments which involved settlers with the English. These were rivalries that not Goevrnor Andros could stop. But their Protestantism was, smoe whispered. Their distress when driven from village down the bay had stirred the town fathers ' sympathy. the strangers had been given a place. The - skinned Etienne Roulet was at farming thna at reading books. Drawing diagrams. He was given a clerk job in the warehouse at Pardon Tillinghast 's wharf. This was in Town Street. There had,, been a riot of some sort. forty years, after Roulet 's death. No one seemed to hear of the family after that. For a century and, it appeared, the Roulets had been remembered. They were discussed as events in the life of a New England seaport. Etienne 's son Paul was a man. His behavior had caused the riot that wiped out the family. He was a source of wonder. Though Providence shared the witchcraft fears of her Puritan neighbors, wives hinted that his prayers were not said at the time. They were not aimed at the thing. All this had formed the base of the story known by Maria Robbins. What relation it had to the ravings of Rhoby Harris. people of the shunned house, imagination. discovery could decide. I wondered how of those who knew the stories saw that link with the terrible. My reading had given me this link. It was that threatening item in the records of horror. It tells of the creature Jacques Roulet, of Caude. In 1598 he was sentenced to death as a demoniac. But he was saved from the stake by the Paris parliament. He was shut in a madhouse. He had been found covered with blood and pieces of flesh in a wood. This was after a boy was killed. Torn by a pair of wolves.\n###\nThe Roulets, it seemed, had come in 1696 from East Greenwich, down the west shore of Narragansett Bay. They were Huguenots from Caude, and had encountered much opposition before the Providence selectmen allowed them to settle in the town. Unpopularity had dogged them in East Greenwich, whither they had come in 1686, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and rumour said that the cause of dislike extended beyond mere racial and national prejudice, or the land disputes which involved other French settlers with the English in rivalries which not even Governor Andros could quell. But their ardent Protestantism\u2014too ardent, some whispered\u2014and their evident distress when virtually driven from the village down the bay, had moved the sympathy of the town fathers. Here the strangers had been granted a haven; and the swarthy Etienne Roulet, less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer diagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at Pardon Tillinghast\u2019s wharf, far south in Town Street. There had, however, been a riot of some sort later on\u2014perhaps forty years later, after old Roulet\u2019s death\u2014and no one seemed to hear of the family after that. For a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been well remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet life of a New England seaport. Etienne\u2019s son Paul, a surly fellow whose erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the family, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence never shared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan neighbours, it was freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at the proper time nor directed toward the proper object. All this had undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins. What relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and other inhabitants of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alone could determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the legends realised that additional link with the terrible which my wide reading had given me; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror which tells of the creature Jacques Roulet, of Caude, who in 1598 was condemned to death as a daemoniac but afterward saved from the stake by the Paris parliament and shut in a madhouse. He had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves."}

And yet, when I flashed my torch upon it in that frightful megalithic abyss, I saw that the queerly pigmented letters on the brittle, aeon-browned cellulose pages were not indeed any nameless hieroglyphs of earth\u2019s youth. They were, instead, the letters of our familiar alphabet, spelling out the words of the English language in my own handwriting. Cautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief that Robert Blake was killed by lightning, or by some profound nervous shock derived from an electrical discharge. It is true that the window he faced was unbroken, but Nature has shewn herself capable of many freakish performances. The expression on his face may easily have arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw, while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old matters he had uncovered. As for the anomalous conditions at the deserted church on Federal Hill\u2014the shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to some charlatanry, conscious or unconscious, with at least some of which Blake was secretly connected. For after all, the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the field of myth, dream, terror, and superstition, and avid in his quest for scenes and effects of a bizarre, spectral sort. His earlier stay in the city\u2014a visit to a strange old man as deeply given to occult and forbidden lore as he\u2014had ended amidst death and flame, and it must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his home in Milwaukee. He may have known of the old stories despite his statements to the contrary in the diary, and his death may have nipped in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection. Among those, however, who have examined and correlated all this evidence, there remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories. They are inclined to take much of Blake\u2019s diary at its face value, and point significantly to certain facts such as the undoubted genuineness of the old church record, the verified existence of the disliked and unorthodox Starry Wisdom sect prior to 1877, the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named Edwin M. Lillibridge in 1893, and\u2014above all\u2014the look of monstrous, transfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died."}

What people thought tehy saw were straight shapes not qutie like any they had ever seen on normal furniture. Naturally, there were many random marks gathered on the wood during that long time of home use. Those who looked at these strange marks felt very sure they were not just wear, even though they looked somewhat similar in depth. Nor, said the watchers, could they have been made by any tool known in the house. They were grayish lines about six inches long. They had jagged paths showing large pairs of parallel grooves. Several groups of crossing lines. Tehy had a kind of messy swirl, surrounded by many very thin hair-like lines, where a center point would normally be. It was truly notable how closely the descriptions from different witnesses matched. The surprise was less because the old family stories, whispered once throughout the family, provided a sickly clear story. This story might well have shaped what all the involved people saw. My conclusion was that such watchers, in every case uneducated. Trusting home pepole, had seen the random. Ordinary scratches from knives. Dishes on the worn plastic surface. They had let the half-remembered stories give these ordinary marks wild meanin.g\n###\nWhat people thought they perceived were linear formations not quite like any they had ever beheld upon common furniture. Naturally, there were many incidental blemishes accumulated upon the wood in that lengthy period of domestic service; but those who studied these strange markings felt quite sure that they were not mere wear, despite some superficial resemblances in depth and general direction. Nor, said the observers, could they have been the work of any utensil known to the household. They were greyish lines about six inches in length; with jagged trajectories exhibiting vast pairs of parallel grooves or dendritic branches and several sets of intersecting furrows, and with a sort of chaotic vortex, surrounded by multitudes of very fine hairlines, where a central point would ordinarily be. It was really remarkable how closely the descriptions from different witnesses tended to coincide; though the wonder was lessened by the fact that the old household tales, whispered at one time throughout the family, furnished a morbidly vivid narrative which might well have coloured the perceptions of all the persons concerned. It was my conclusion that such observers\u2014in every case untutored and credulous domestic folk\u2014had glimpsed the random and mundane abrasions of cutlery or crockery upon the worn laminate; and had allowed the half-remembered anecdotes to invest these prosaic traces with fantastic significance."}

They stumble down black, cobwebbed steps under the scattered stones of forgotten cities in Asia. The haunted forest and the lonely mountain are their holy places. They stay around the evil stone monuments on empty islands. The true lover of the terrible, who lives for a new feeling of unspeakable horror, values most the old, lonely farmhouses in the backwoods of New England. There, the dark qualities of strength, loneliness, strangeness. Lack of knowledge combine to create the perfect hideous thing. The most horrible sights of all are the little wooden houses with no paint, far from roads. They usually sit on some wet, grassy hill or lean against some huge rock. For two hundred years or more, they have leaned or sat there. Vines have grown and trees have become large and spread out. They are almost hidden now by wild, thick green plants and protective shadows. But the small-windowed panes still stare in a shocking way. It is as if they are blinking through a deadly daze. This daze keeps away madness by making the memory of unspeakable things dull. In such houses have lived generations of strange people. The world has never seen their like. Seized with a dark. Extreme belief that made them outcasts, their ancestors looked for freedom in the wilderness. There, the children of a conquering people did grow free from the rules of others. But thye lived in a terrible slavery to the gloomy ghsots of their own minds. Divorced from the light of civilization, strength of these Puritans turned into unusual paths. In their isolation, unhealthy self-control. Fight for life against relentless Nature, they gained dark, secret traits from ancient depths of their cold Northern ancestry. By need, they were practical. By belief, they were strict. These people were not beautiful in their wrongdoigns. Erring as all huamns must, their strict rules forced them to hide things aobve all else. So they came to care less and less about good taste in what they hdi. Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has been hidden since the old days. They are not talkative, as they hate to shake off the sleepiness that helps them forget.\n###\nFor them are the catacombs of Ptolemais, and the carven mausolea of the nightmare countries. They climb to the moonlit towers of ruined Rhine castles, and falter down black cobwebbed steps beneath the scattered stones of forgotten cities in Asia. The haunted wood and the desolate mountain are their shrines, and they linger around the sinister monoliths on uninhabited islands. But the true epicure in the terrible, to whom a new thrill of unutterable ghastliness is the chief end and justification of existence, esteems most of all the ancient, lonely farmhouses of backwoods New England; for there the dark elements of strength, solitude, grotesqueness, and ignorance combine to form the perfection of the hideous. Most horrible of all sights are the little unpainted wooden houses remote from travelled ways, usually squatted upon some damp, grassy slope or leaning against some gigantic outcropping of rock. Two hundred years and more they have leaned or squatted there, while the vines have crawled and the trees have swelled and spread. They are almost hidden now in lawless luxuriances of green and guardian shrouds of shadow; but the small-paned windows still stare shockingly, as if blinking through a lethal stupor which wards off madness by dulling the memory of unutterable things. In such houses have dwelt generations of strange people, whose like the world has never seen. Seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from their kind, their ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom. There the scions of a conquering race indeed flourished free from the restrictions of their fellows, but cowered in an appalling slavery to the dismal phantasms of their own minds. Divorced from the enlightenment of civilisation, the strength of these Puritans turned into singular channels; and in their isolation, morbid self-repression, and struggle for life with relentless Nature, there came to them dark furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold Northern heritage. By necessity practical and by philosophy stern, these folk were not beautiful in their sins. Erring as all mortals must, they were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else; so that they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed. Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days; and they are not communicative, being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget."}

It made a rattling sound. There were three passengers on it. A man on sidewalk looked evil. He muttered some words to the driver. The words weer to understand. Sargent threw out a mail bag. Sargent aslo threw out a roll of newspapers. Then Sargent went into the hotel. The passengers walked to the sidewalk. They were the same men I saw arrive in Newburyport thta morning. They moved in a slow, shuffling way. They spoke some throaty words to a loafer. I believe the language was not English. I got on the bus. I sat in the same seat as before. I had just sat down when Sargent came back. Sargent began to mumble in a throaty voice. The voice was very unpleasant. I was in very luck. There was something wrong with the engine. This was true even though the trip from Newburyport was fast. The bus could not go all the way to Arkham. No, it could not be fixed that night. Also, there was no other way to get a ride out of Innsmouth. This was true for going to Arkham or any other place. Sargent was sorry. I would have to stay at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would give me a price. But there was nothing else I could do. I was dazed by this sudden problem. I also greatly feared the night coming to this town. The town was decaying and had few lights. I left the bus. I went back into the hotel lobby. The night clerk looked sullen and He said I could have room 428. It was on the floor next to the top floor. The room was But it had no running water. The cost was one dollar. I had heard things about this hotel in Newburyport. But I signed the register. I paid my dollar. I let the clerk take my suitcase. I followed the sour, lone attendant. We went up three flights of stairs. The stairs ceraked. We passed dusty hallways. hallways seemde to have no life at all. My room was at the back. It was dismal. It had two windows. The furniture was bare and cheap. The room looked out on a dingy courtyard. The courtyard was surrounded by brick buildings. The view also showed roofs stretching to the west. Beyond that was marshy countryside. At the end of the hall was a bathroom. It was a discouraging relic. It had an marble bowl. It had a tin tub. It had a faint electric Musty wodo panels were around all the pipes. It was still daytime. I went down to the Square. I looked for some kind of dinner. As I did this, I noticed the looks from the unhealthy loafers. The grocery store was closed. So I had to go to the restaurant I avoided before. A stooped man was there. He had a head. His eyes stared and did not blink. A flat-nosed woman was also there. She had unbelievably clumsy hands. They were in attendance.\n###\nThe bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight, and an evil-looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver. Sargent threw out a mail-bag and a roll of newspapers, and entered the hotel; while the passengers\u2014the same men whom I had seen arriving in Newburyport that morning\u2014shambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint guttural words with a loafer in a language I could have sworn was not English. I boarded the empty coach and took the same seat I had taken before, but was hardly settled before Sargent reappeared and began mumbling in a throaty voice of peculiar repulsiveness. I was, it appeared, in very bad luck. There had been something wrong with the engine, despite the excellent time made from Newburyport, and the bus could not complete the journey to Arkham. No, it could not possibly be repaired that night, nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of Innsmouth, either to Arkham or elsewhere. Sargent was sorry, but I would have to stop over at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would make the price easy for me, but there was nothing else to do. Almost dazed by this sudden obstacle, and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and half-unlighted town, I left the bus and re-entered the hotel lobby; where the sullen, queer-looking night clerk told me I could have Room 428 on next the top floor\u2014large, but without running water\u2014for a dollar. Despite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburyport, I signed the register, paid my dollar, let the clerk take my valise, and followed that sour, solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life. My room, a dismal rear one with two windows and bare, cheap furnishings, overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low, deserted brick blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward-stretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond. At the end of the corridor was a bathroom\u2014a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric light, and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures. It being still daylight, I descended to the Square and looked around for a dinner of some sort; noticing as I did so the strange glances I received from the unwholesome loafers. Since the grocery was closed, I was forced to patronise the restaurant I had shunned before; a stooped, narrow-headed man with staring, unwinking eyes, and a flat-nosed wench with unbelievably thick, clumsy hands being in attendance."}

Seething, stewing, surging, bubbling like serpents\u2019 slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole, spreading like a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of egress\u2014streaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests and strew fear, madness, and death. God knows how many there were\u2014there must have been thousands. To see the stream of them in that faint, intermittent lightning was shocking. When they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms, I saw that they were dwarfed, deformed hairy devils or apes\u2014monstrous and diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe. They were so hideously silent; there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers turned with the skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed fashion on a weaker companion. Others snapped up what it left and ate with slavering relish. Then, in spite of my daze of fright and disgust, my morbid curiosity triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare, I drew my automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder. Shrieking, slithering, torrential shadows of red viscous madness chasing one another through endless, ensanguined corridors of purple fulgurous sky . . . formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a ghoulish, remembered scene; forests of monstrous overnourished oaks with serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth verminous with millions of cannibal devils; mound-like tentacles groping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion . . . insane lightning over malignant ivied walls and daemon arcades choked with fungous vegetation. . . . Heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men dwell; to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing skies. I had recovered enough in a week to send to Albany for a gang of men to blow up the Martense mansion and the entire top of Tempest Mountain with dynamite, stop up all the discoverable mound-burrows, and destroy certain overnourished trees whose very existence seemed an insult to sanity."}

They always do that about Innsmouth people, and folks here and hereabouts always try to cover up any Innsmouth blood they have in \u2019em. But Marsh\u2019s children and grandchildren look just like anyone else so far\u2019s I can see. I\u2019ve had \u2019em pointed out to me here\u2014though, come to think of it, the elder children don\u2019t seem to be around lately. Never saw the old man. \u201cAnd why is everybody so down on Innsmouth? Well, young fellow, you mustn\u2019t take too much stock in what people around here say. They\u2019re hard to get started, but once they do get started they never let up. They\u2019ve ben telling things about Innsmouth\u2014whispering \u2019em, mostly\u2014for the last hundred years, I guess, and I gather they\u2019re more scared than anything else. Some of the stories would make you laugh\u2014about old Captain Marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or about some kind of devil-worship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereabouts\u2014but I come from Panton, Vermont, and that kind of story don\u2019t go down with me. \u201cYou ought to hear, though, what some of the old-timers tell about the black reef off the coast\u2014Devil Reef, they call it."}

I entered an area of complete emptiness that made me shhiver. Groups of gambrel roofs formed a uneven and strange skyilne. Above them rose the frightening, damaged steeple of an oold church. Some houses along Main Street were occupied. But most were closed up with boards. On the unpaved side streets, I saw the black, empty windows of abandoned huts. Many of these leaned at dangerous and unbelievable angles. This WAS due to parts of their foundations sinking. Those windows stared so ghostly that I neeeded courage to turn east toward the waterfront.. Indeed, the fear of a deserted house grows much faster as houses multiply to form a city of pure emptiness. The sight of such endless streets of vacatn, dead-eyed buildings starts deep fears. The thought of endless connected black rooms left to spiderss, memories. Decay starts old fears. The strongest philosophy cannot remove these feelings.\n###\nRe-crossing the gorge on the Main Street bridge, I struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder. Collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline, above which rose the ghoulish, decapitated steeple of an ancient church. Some houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse."}

Shelves from floor to ceiling. The shelves held, falling books., for the time, he got a shock of horror. The titles of those books todl him. They were the, forbidden things people have heard of. Or they have headr in, whispers. They were the banned and feared collections of secrets and formulas. These have trickled down through time from the days of man 's youth. And from the dim, days before man existed. He himself had read of them. A version of the hated Necronomicon. The Liber Ivonis. The Cultes des Goules of Comte d'Erlette. Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt. And Ludvig Prinn 's De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he knew by name or not. The Pnakotic Manuscripts. The Book of Dzyan. And a crumbling book in writing. It had symbols. Diagrams that an occult student would recognize with a shudder., the rumors had not lied. This place had been the home of an evil than mankind. It was than the known universe. In the ruined desk was a leather - bound record book. It was filled with entries in some code. The text used the symbols used today in astronomy. They were used in, astrology, and arts. The symbols for the sun, moon, planets, aspects, and zodiac signs. they were packed in pages of text. Divisions and paragraphs suggested each symbol stood for a letter of the alphabet. Hoping to solve the code, Blake took this book in his coat pocket. of the books on the shelves fascinated him beyond words. He felt tempted to borrow them some time. He wondered how they could have stayed. Was he the to overcome the gripping, fear? That fear had protected this place from visitors for sixty years. Having explored the ground floor. Blake pushed through the dust of the hall to the entrance. he had seen a door. Stairs leading up to the blackened tower. These were objects to him from. The climb up was a choking experience. Dust lay. Spiders had done their in this space.\n###\nIn a rear vestry room beside the apse Blake found a rotting desk and ceiling-high shelves of mildewed, disintegrating books. Here for the first time he received a positive shock of objective horror, for the titles of those books told him much. They were the black, forbidden things which most sane people have never even heard of, or have heard of only in furtive, timorous whispers; the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secrets and immemorial formulae which have trickled down the stream of time from the days of man\u2019s youth, and the dim, fabulous days before man was. He had himself read many of them\u2014a Latin version of the abhorred Necronomicon, the sinister Liber Ivonis, the infamous Cultes des Goules of Comte d\u2019Erlette, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and old Ludvig Prinn\u2019s hellish De Vermis Mysteriis. But there were others he had known merely by reputation or not at all\u2014the Pnakotic Manuscripts, the Book of Dzyan, and a crumbling volume in wholly unidentifiable characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shudderingly recognisable to the occult student. Clearly, the lingering local rumours had not lied. This place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe. In the ruined desk was a small leather-bound record-book filled with entries in some odd cryptographic medium. The manuscript writing consisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy, astrology, and other dubious arts\u2014the devices of the sun, moon, planets, aspects, and zodiacal signs\u2014here massed in solid pages of text, with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical letter. In the hope of later solving the cryptogram, Blake bore off this volume in his coat pocket. Many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably, and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time. He wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long. Was he the first to conquer the clutching, pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years protected this deserted place from visitors? Having now thoroughly explored the ground floor, Blake ploughed again through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule, where he had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple\u2014objects so long familiar to him at a distance. The ascent was a choking experience, for dust lay thick, while the spiders had done their worst in this constricted place."}

They do not mean household madness on the part of the pesron doing them. The homeowner himself, though clearly tired and determined, was still sound in his general behavior.

Though ghasts cannot live in real light, they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for hours. So at length Carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of Col. Nehemiah Derby, obiit 1719, from the Charter Street Burying Ground in Salem. When they came again into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones of the gugs. On the right of the hole out of which they wriggled, and seen through aisles of monoliths, was a stupendous vista of Cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of inner earth. This was the great city of the gugs, whose doorways are thirty feet high. Ghouls come here often, for a buried gug will feed a community for almost a year, and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men. Carter now understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of Pnath. Straight ahead, and just outside the cemetery, rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned. This the ghouls told Carter to avoid as much as possible, since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of Zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness. And truly, that warning was soon well justified; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs\u2019 resting had been rightly timed, there glowed in the gloom of that great cavern\u2019s mouth first one pair of yellowish-red eyes and then another, implying that the gugs were one sentry less, and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell. So the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent. It was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices, and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw, since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black vaults. After a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight, and Carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast, whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose, a forehead, and other important particulars."}

This was because his cheerful. Self - assured moods in the car became. He wanted to move into the Derby mansion., Asenath insisted on staying in the Crowninshield house. She had become. Not, my wife heard a story from a friend. This friend was one of the who kept in touch with the Derbys. The friend had gone to the end of High St to visit the couple. She saw a car leave the driveway. Edward 's and mocking face was above the steering wheel. She rang Ringing the bell. The maid told her that Asenath was out. But as she was leaving, she happened to look up at the house., at one of Edward 's library windows, she saw a face that was pulled. The expression on taht face showed pain, defeat, and a longing hopelessness. It was moving beyond words., considering its commanding look, it was Asenath 's face. The visitor swore that in that moment, the, eyes of Edward were looking out frmo it. Edward 's visits to me became a. His hints became statements. What he said was, in, legend - filled Arkham. He shared his knowledge with sincerity. Persuasiveness that it made one worry for his mind. He talked about meetings in places. He spoke of Cyclopean ruins in the middle of the Maine woods. Under these ruins, staircases lead down to pits of secrets. He mentioned angles taht go through walls to areas of space. He described exchanges of personality. These exchanges allowed explorations in. places, on worlds. In space - time continuums. and, he would support his hints by showing objects. These objects confused me. They had colors and puzzling textures unlike anything known on Earth. Their curves and surfaces served no purpose and followed no known geometry. He said these things came ' from outside '. His wife knew how to obtain them., he would suggest things about Ephraim Waite. He had seen Ephraim Waite at the college library in the past. He said these things in and whispers. These hints were detailed. They seemed to center on a doubt. The doutb was whether the wizard was \u2014 in a sense as a one.\n###\nSome called him callous in his loss\u2014especially since those jaunty and confident moods in the car began to increase. He now wished to move back into the old Derby mansion, but Asenath insisted on staying in the Crowninshield house, to which she had become well adjusted. Not long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend\u2014one of the few who had not dropped the Derbys. She had been out to the end of High St. to call on the couple, and had seen a car shoot briskly out of the drive with Edward\u2019s oddly confident and almost sneering face above the wheel. Ringing the bell, she had been told by the repulsive wench that Asenath was also out; but had chanced to look up at the house in leaving. There, at one of Edward\u2019s library windows, she had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn face\u2014a face whose expression of pain, defeat, and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description. It was\u2014incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast\u2014Asenath\u2019s; yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad, muddled eyes of poor Edward were gazing out from it. Edward\u2019s calls now grew a trifle more frequent, and his hints occasionally became concrete. What he said was not to be believed, even in centuried and legend-haunted Arkham; but he threw out his dark lore with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear for his sanity. He talked about terrible meetings in lonely places, of Cyclopean ruins in the heart of the Maine woods beneath which vast staircases lead down to abysses of nighted secrets, of complex angles that lead through invisible walls to other regions of space and time, and of hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and forbidden places, on other worlds, and in different space-time continua. He would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects which utterly nonplussed me\u2014elusively coloured and bafflingly textured objects like nothing ever heard of on earth, whose insane curves and surfaces answered no conceivable purpose and followed no conceivable geometry. These things, he said, came \u2018from outside\u2019; and his wife knew how to get them. Sometimes\u2014but always in frightened and ambiguous whispers\u2014he would suggest things about old Ephraim Waite, whom he had seen occasionally at the college library in the old days. These adumbrations were never specific, but seemed to revolve around some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really dead\u2014in a spiritual as well as corporeal sense."}

No traveler has escaped a sense of strangeness in those ravines.

No traveller has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirit as of the eye. I myself am curious about the sensation I derived from my one lone walk before Ammi told me his tale. When twilight came I had vaguely wished some clouds would gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul. Do not ask me for my opinion. I do not know\u2014that is all. There was no one but Ammi to question; for Arkham people will not talk about the strange days, and all three professors who saw the a\u00ebrolite and its coloured globule are dead. There were other globules\u2014depend upon that. One must have fed itself and escaped, and probably there was another which was too late. No doubt it is still down the well\u2014I know there was something wrong with the sunlight I saw above that miasmal brink. The rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year, so perhaps there is a kind of growth or nourishment even now. But whatever daemon hatchling is there, it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread. Is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air? One of the current Arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move as they ought not to do at night. What it is, only God knows. In terms of matter I suppose the thing Ammi described would be called a gas, but this gas obeyed laws that are not of our cosmos. This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories. This was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to measure. It was just a colour out of space\u2014a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes. I doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think his tale was all a freak of madness as the townfolk had forewarned."}

He admitted the oddness of his behavior. The style of language he had fallen into. He said this was from devotion to study and research. He said he was studying details of tradition. This required the contact with groups and their songs and folk dances. The idea that any society was victimizing him, as hinted by his relatives, was. It showed how limited their understanding of him and his work was. Triumphing with his explanations, he was allowed to leave. The paid detectives of the Suydams, Corlears, and Van Brunts were called off in disgust. It was that a team of Federal inspectors. Police, Malone with tehm, entered the case. The law had watched the Suydam case with interest. It had been asked to help detectives. In this work, it was found that Suydam 's friends were among the. criminals of Red Hook 's winding alleys. At a third of them were known. Repeat offenders in theft, disorder. Bringing in immigrants.\n###\nIt was based on certain odd changes in his speech and habits; wild references to impending wonders, and unaccountable hauntings of disreputable Brooklyn neighbourhoods. He had been growing shabbier and shabbier with the years, and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant; seen occasionally by humiliated friends in subway stations, or loitering on the benches around Borough Hall in conversation with groups of swarthy, evil-looking strangers. When he spoke it was to babble of unlimited powers almost within his grasp, and to repeat with knowing leers such mystical words or names as \u201cSephiroth\u201d, \u201cAshmodai\u201d, and \u201cSama\u00ebl\u201d. The court action revealed that he was using up his income and wasting his principal in the purchase of curious tomes imported from London and Paris, and in the maintenance of a squalid basement flat in the Red Hook district where he spent nearly every night, receiving odd delegations of mixed rowdies and foreigners, and apparently conducting some kind of ceremonial service behind the green blinds of secretive windows. Detectives assigned to follow him reported strange cries and chants and prancing of feet filtering out from these nocturnal rites, and shuddered at their peculiar ecstasy and abandon despite the commonness of weird orgies in that sodden section. When, however, the matter came to a hearing, Suydam managed to preserve his liberty. Before the judge his manner grew urbane and reasonable, and he freely admitted the queerness of demeanour and extravagant cast of language into which he had fallen through excessive devotion to study and research. He was, he said, engaged in the investigation of certain details of European tradition which required the closest contact with foreign groups and their songs and folk dances. The notion that any low secret society was preying upon him, as hinted by his relatives, was obviously absurd; and shewed how sadly limited was their understanding of him and his work. Triumphing with his calm explanations, he was suffered to depart unhindered; and the paid detectives of the Suydams, Corlears, and Van Brunts were withdrawn in resigned disgust. It was here that an alliance of Federal inspectors and police, Malone with them, entered the case. The law had watched the Suydam action with interest, and had in many instances been called upon to aid the private detectives. In this work it developed that Suydam\u2019s new associates were among the blackest and most vicious criminals of Red Hook\u2019s devious lanes, and that at least a third of them were known and repeated offenders in the matter of thievery, disorder, and the importation of illegal immigrants."}

I ignored everything except the animal urge to run. I fought and pushed over the rubble on the slope. I acted as if the crakc did not exist. I saw the edge of the chasm. I leaped with all my strength. I was swallowed by a whirlpool of sound., blackness. This is the end of my experience, as I can remember. Any feelings belong to the world of delirium. Dream, insanity, and memory mixed. They formed a series of, illusions. These can have no connection to anything. There was a fall through miles of, darkness. There was a confusion of noises to all we know of Earth. Its life., senses seemed to come in me. They told of pits and spaces filled with floating horrors. They led to sunless cliffs and oceans and cities. These cities had basalt towers where no light shone. Secrets of the planet and its ages flashed through my brain. This happened without help of sight or sound. I knew things that not the of my past dreams had hinted at. All the while, fingers of mist grabbed and pulled at me. That, whistling screamed above all the changes between noise and silence. This happened in the whirlpools of darkness around me. there were visions of the city from my dreams. It was not in ruins. It was as I had dreamed it. I was in my cone - shaped, body. I mixed with crowds of the Great Race and the captured minds. They carried books up and down the corridors and slopes., over these pictures, came, flashes of a awareness. This involved struggles. It involved twisting from grabbing tentacles of whistling wind. It involved an, bat - flight through - air. It involved a digging through the cyclone - beaten dark. It involved a stumbling and climbing over fallen stonework. there was a, flash of - vision. It was a, spread - out hint of light. caem a dream of climbing and crawling pursued by wind. It involved squeezing into a glare of mocking moonlight. This was through a pile of wreckage that slid. Fell behind me in a hurricane.\n###\nNow, indeed, the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity departed\u2014and ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline\u2019s debris as if no gulf had existed. Then I saw the chasm\u2019s edge, leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength I possessed, and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniac vortex of loathsome sound and utter, materially tangible blackness. This is the end of my experience, so far as I can recall. Any further impressions belong wholly to the domain of phantasmagoric delirium. Dream, madness, and memory merged wildly together in a series of fantastic, fragmentary delusions which can have no relation to anything real. There was a hideous fall through incalculable leagues of viscous, sentient darkness, and a babel of noises utterly alien to all that we know of the earth and its organic life. Dormant, rudimentary senses seemed to start into vitality within me, telling of pits and voids peopled by floating horrors and leading to sunless crags and oceans and teeming cities of windowless basalt towers upon which no light ever shone. Secrets of the primal planet and its immemorial aeons flashed through my brain without the aid of sight or sound, and there were known to me things which not even the wildest of my former dreams had ever suggested. And all the while cold fingers of damp vapour clutched and picked at me, and that eldritch, damnable whistling shrieked fiendishly above all the alternations of babel and silence in the whirlpools of darkness around. Afterward there were visions of the Cyclopean city of my dreams\u2014not in ruins, but just as I had dreamed of it. I was in my conical, non-human body again, and mingled with crowds of the Great Race and the captive minds who carried books up and down the lofty corridors and vast inclines. Then, superimposed upon these pictures, were frightful momentary flashes of a non-visual consciousness involving desperate struggles, a writhing free from clutching tentacles of whistling wind, an insane, bat-like flight through half-solid air, a feverish burrowing through the cyclone-whipped dark, and a wild stumbling and scrambling over fallen masonry. Once there was a curious, intrusive flash of half-sight\u2014a faint, diffuse suspicion of bluish radiance far overhead. Then there came a dream of wind-pursued climbing and crawling\u2014of wriggling into a blaze of sardonic moonlight through a jumble of debris which slid and collapsed after me amidst a morbid hurricane."}

Most declining sculptures a clumsy early mammal. This mammal was sometimes used for [THING]. Sometimes as a funny clown by the land dwellers. Its somewhat ape - like and human - like hints were clear. In the construction of land cities, the huge [THING] blocks of the tall towers were usually lifted by large - winged pterodactyls. This type of pterodactyl was not konwn to the study of ancient life before. The way the Old Ones continued to exist through different geological changes. [THING] crust movements was almost like a miracle. None of their first cities appear to have lasted past the Archaean age, there was no break in their society. In the passing down of their records. Their original place of arrival on the planet was the Antarctic Ocean. It is probable that they came not long after the material that formed the [THING] was pulled from the nearby South Pacific. According to one of carved maps, the entire world was under [HTING] then. [THING] cities were spread farther. Farther from the south polar region as very long periods went by. Another map shows a very large area of dry land around the south pole. It is celar that some of the beings made test settlements there. However, their main centers were moved to the closest [THING] [THING]. Later maps show this land mass breaking apart and moving. They show some separated parts going north. These maps strongly support the idesa of continent movement recently put forward by Taylor, Wegener. When new land rose in the South Pacific, very big events started. Some of the [THING] cities were completely destroyed. But that was not the worts problem. Another gropu, a land group of beings shaped like octopuses, probably matching the mythical pre - human offspring of Cthulhu, soon started coming down from endless space. This started a horrible war. For a while, this war psuhed the Old Ones completely back to the [THING]. This was a huge setback considering the growing land settlements. Later, peace was established. The new lands were given to the Cthulhu offspring. Meanwhile, the Old Ones kept the [THING] and the older lands. New land cities were established. The greatest of them was in the south polar region. This area of first arrival was holy. From that time on, as before, the south polar region stayed the center of the Old Ones ' society. All the cities that could be found built there by the Cthulhu offspring were erased.\n###\nBothersome forms, of course, were mechanically exterminated. It interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent sculptures a shambling primitive mammal, used sometimes for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to palaeontology. The persistence with which the Old Ones survived various geologic changes and convulsions of the earth\u2019s crust was little short of miraculous. Though few or none of their first cities seem to have remained beyond the Archaean age, there was no interruption in their civilisation or in the transmission of their records. Their original place of advent to the planet was the Antarctic Ocean, and it is likely that they came not long after the matter forming the moon was wrenched from the neighbouring South Pacific. According to one of the sculptured maps, the whole globe was then under water, with stone cities scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as aeons passed. Another map shews a vast bulk of dry land around the south pole, where it is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements though their main centres were transferred to the nearest sea-bottom. Later maps, which display this land mass as cracking and drifting, and sending certain detached parts northward, uphold in a striking way the theories of continental drift lately advanced by Taylor, Wegener, and Joly. With the upheaval of new land in the South Pacific tremendous events began. Some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered, yet that was not the worst misfortune. Another race\u2014a land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably corresponding to the fabulous pre-human spawn of Cthulhu\u2014soon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the Old Ones wholly back to the sea\u2014a colossal blow in view of the increasing land settlements. Later peace was made, and the new lands were given to the Cthulhu spawn whilst the Old Ones held the sea and the older lands. New land cities were founded\u2014the greatest of them in the antarctic, for this region of first arrival was sacred. From then on, as before, the antarctic remained the centre of the Old Ones\u2019 civilisation, and all the discoverable cities built there by the Cthulhu spawn were blotted out."}

He deeply regretted the mistake which made him put the bowl in that machine with the humming door. As the timer got closer to its end.

He no doubt got his liking from the markets around him. He also got it from the examples of ripe produce which filled every stall of his family's usual fruit stroe in Elm Street on the edge of the area. With the seasons, his dedication to fresh things grew. Gardening, plant family lines. The study of shapes, textures. Marks at last pushed everything else from his area of study. These likes are important to remember when thinking about his pickiness. They do not form its exact center, they play a part in its surface show. The slips in judgment which the other shoppers saw were all about common choices. They were always balanced by an equally but hidden knowledge of forgotten types. This knowledge came out through skillful looking. One might think the buyer was literally moved to a past harvest through some unclear kind of sense fixation. The thing was that Harris seemed no longer interested in the perfect examples he knew. It appears he had lost his respect for them through pure overexposure. All his final tries were clearly aimed at learning those ordinary choices of the modern market. These had been so completely and clearly erased from his awareness. He did his best to hide that this total deletion had happened. It was celar to all who watched him that his whole plan of looking. Touching was driven by a desperate wish. He wanted to take in such knowledge of common apples. Of the normal practical. Beauty standards of today's shopper. This knowledge should have been his because of his daily trips. His training in the markets of our own time. Grocers are now wondering how, given his badly reduced range of standards, the confused customer deals with today's complicated produce. The main opinion is that he is 'waiting carefully' in some simple and undemanding bin. He waits until his supply of everyday information can be raised to the usual level.\n###\nJonathan Harris was a connoisseur of produce from infancy, no doubt gaining his predilection from the abundant markets around him, and from the specimens of ripeness which filled every stall of his family\u2019s accustomed greengrocer in Elm Street on the edge of the district. With the seasons his devotion to fresh things increased; so that horticulture, varietal lineage, and the study of heirloom shapes, textures, and blemishes at length crowded everything else from his sphere of scrutiny. These predilections are important to remember in considering his fastidiousness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial manifestation. The lapses of judgment which the other shoppers noticed were all related to commonplace selections, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of forgotten cultivars as brought out by adroit observation; so that one would have fancied the buyer literally transferred to a former harvest through some obscure sort of sensory fixation. The singular thing was that Harris seemed no longer interested in the perfect specimens he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer saturation; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those vulgar choices of the modern mart which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his perception. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of inspection and palpation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of common apples and of the ordinary practical and aesthetic standards of the contemporary consumer as ought to have been his by virtue of his daily errands and his tutelage in the markets of our own age. Grocers are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of criteria, the perplexed customer manages to cope with the complicated produce of today; the dominant opinion being that he is \u2018lingering cautiously\u2019 in some humble and unexacting bin till his stock of mundane information can be brought up to the conventional."}

Their houses had even spread up the mountain's side. The higher they built, the more people they would miss when the sun came up. Finally, they decided it was better to leave completely. This was because things were sometimes seen in the dark. No one could explain these things in a godo way. So in the end, all of them went down to the sea. They lived in Baharna. They lived in a very old part of the city. They taught their sons the old skill of making images. They still do this work today. Carter heard the best stories about Ngranek from these children. Their parents were the exilde hill people. Carter heard the stories while searching through old taverns of Baharna. All this time, the great, bare side of Ngranek rose higher and higher. Carter was getting closer to it. There were a few teres on lower slope. Weak shrubs grew above them. Then the bare, ugly rock rose like a ghost into the sky. It mixed with frost and ice and permanent snow. Carter could see the cracks and rough parts of that dark stone. He did not like the idea of climbing it. In some places, there were solid rivers of lava. There were piles of roguh lava that coveerd slopes and ledges. Ninety ages ag,o even before the gods had danced on its sharp peak, that mountain had spoken with fire. It had roared wtih the voices of the deep thunders. Now it stood tall, silent, and threatening. On the hidden side, it held the secret giant statue. Rumors tlod of this statue. There were caves in that mountain. They might be empty and alone with ancient darkness. Or they might hold horrors of a shape that cannot be imagined. This would be true if the legends are correct. The ground solped up to the foot of Ngranek. It was thinly covered with small oak trees and ash trees. It was scattered with pieces of rock, lava, and old cinder. There were the burned remains of many camps. The lava-gatherers used to stop there. There were several rough altars. They had built these either to please the Great Ones. To keep away what they dreamed of. Their dreams were about Ngranek's high passes and twisting caves. In the evening, Carter reached the farthest pile of ashes. He camped there for the night. He tied his zebra to a young tree. He wrapped himself well in his blanket before sleeping. All through the night, a voonith howled far away. It came from the shore of some hidden pool. But Carter felt no fear of that water-and-land treror. He had been told for sure that not one of them dares to even come near the slopes of Ngranek.\n###\nTheir homes had crept even up the mountain\u2019s slope, and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose. At last they decided it would be better to leave altogether, since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret favourably; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in Baharna, inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art of image-making which to this day they carry on. It was from these children of the exiled hill-people that Carter had heard the best tales about Ngranek when searching through Baharna\u2019s ancient taverns. All this time the great gaunt side of Ngranek was looming up higher and higher as Carter approached it. There were sparse trees on the lower slope, and feeble shrubs above them, and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow. Carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone, and did not welcome the prospect of climbing it. In places there were solid streams of lava, and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges. Ninety aeons ago, before even the gods had danced upon its pointed peak, that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner thunders. Now it towered all silent and sinister, bearing on the hidden side that secret titan image whereof rumour told. And there were caves in that mountain, which might be empty and alone with elder darkness, or might\u2014if legend spoke truly\u2014hold horrors of a form not to be surmised. The ground sloped upward to the foot of Ngranek, thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash trees, and strown with bits of rock, lava, and ancient cinder. There were the charred embers of many camps, where the lava-gatherers were wont to stop, and several rude altars which they had built either to propitiate the Great Ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in Ngranek\u2019s high passes and labyrinthine caves. At evening Carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night, tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his blanket before going to sleep. And all through the night a voonith howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool, but Carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror, since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slopes of Ngranek."}

The clerk gave his report quickly and fully to the messy group. Four papers immediately left through different stacks. They srpead their information to others. They gathered any documents needed for the audit. After a long time, an important memo appeared. It made serious signs to the scattered pens. This caused two pens to roll away into the dark corners. Thereatfer Moer and more stationery kept piling up on the blotter. Finally, the stained wood was almost hidden by it. Meanwhile, modern envelopes slowly came out of the trays one by one.

Thereafter there were constant accretions to the heaped congregation of stationery upon the blotter, till at length the stained wood was fairly obscured with them.

My opened eyes sought the corners of decay in curious horror, but the hanging bulb still cast its pallid glow, and the accumulated detritus was still chaotically heaped. \u201cIt is better cluttered, for it was unfit to bear the ordered arrangements of domestic entity. Its crude confines could not undergo the needed clearances between useful life and forgotten life. It was too much a cavern, too little a chamber; yet it is through its deficiency that you have come to discover me, for the ordered and the chaotic rightly should never meet. It has been my torment and diurnal repository for forty-two of your terrestrial years. I am an essence like that which you yourself confront in the dread of tangible wakefulness. I am your brother of dust, and have settled with you in the particulate valleys. It is not permitted me to tell your tidy house-self of your real self, but we are all gatherers of vast hoards and keepers of many ages. Next year I may be dwelling in the dark recess which you call the rear wall, or in the cruel empire of rust which is to come three seasons hence. You and I have drifted among the tools that lie about the red toolbox, and dwelt in the forms of the spider-architects that crawl silently over the fourth shelf of lumber. How little does the house-self know of possession and its extent! How little, indeed, ought it to know for its own tranquillity! Of the organizer I cannot speak. You in the house have unwittingly felt its distant presence\u2014you who without knowing idly gave to its blinking container the name of the bin, the Daemon-Box. It is to meet and conquer the organizer that I have vainly striven for seasons, held back by material encumbrances. Tonight I go as a Nemesis bearing just and blazingly cataclysmic disorder. Watch me in the corner close by the Daemon-Box. I cannot speak longer, for the space of the old garage grows full and rigid, and the coarse contents are ceasing to accumulate as I wish. You have been my friend in the chaos; you have been my only friend in this suburb\u2014the only soul to sense and seek for me within the repellent forms which lie on these shelves. We shall meet again\u2014perhaps in the shining grime of the workbench\u2019s edge, perhaps on a bleak pile of unsorted periodicals.

After stepping to the doorway, Mr. Wilkins saw the clerk inside. He was excitedly gathering a huge armful of office material of every size and shape. clerk's appearance was very tired and worn. He dropped his whole load with a jump at the sound of his boss's voice. At the older man's order, he sat down. For some time he listened to the warnings he had so long deserved. There was no big scene. At the end of the talk, he agreed that his boss was right. His erasures, mutterings, notes, and ink-stain smells were indeed unforgivable annoyances. He agreed to a plan of greater order. But he insisted on a continuation of his extreme independence. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely office research. He could get a small study sapce elsewhere for any such spoken rituals as might be needed at a later time. For the confusion and alarm of the receptionist, he expressed the deepest regret. He explained that the number chants later overheard were part of a complex symbol systme. It was designed to create a certain process atmosphere. His use of hard-to-understand insurance terms somewhat confused Mr. Wilkins. The final feeling was one of clear skill. Calm, despite a mysterious tension of the greatest seriousness. The meeting was really quite without a clear result. As the clerk picked up his armful and left the room, Mr. Wilkins hardly knwe what to think of the whole matter.

In the central aisle, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused annex of the accounting department. Forms were apparently being shuffled about and documents wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the threshold Mr. Wilkins beheld the clerk within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of bureaucratic matter of every size and shape. The clerk\u2019s aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his supervisor\u2019s voice. At the elder man\u2019s command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his supervisor was right, and that his erasures, mutterings, annotations, and ink-stain odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater order, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme autonomy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely clerical research; and he could obtain a carrel elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the confusion and consternation of the receptionist he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the numerical incantations later overheard were part of an elaborate symbology designed to create a certain procedural atmosphere. His use of abstruse actuarial terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Wilkins, but the parting impression was one of undeniable competence and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as the clerk picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Wilkins hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the misfiling of the old Henderson claim, whose confounding folio had been found an hour before in the supply closet, with cryptic endorsements and fear-distorted marginalia."}

This is because it is on a side of Ngranek. That side overlooks cliffs and a valley of threatening lava. Once the gods were with men on that side. Spoke of matter to the Gods. It was to get this information from the traders and sailors in Dylath - Leen 's sea - taverns. They preferred to whisper about the ships. One of these ships was in a week with rubies from its shore. The townspeople dreaded to see it dock. The mouths of the men who came from it to trade were. The way theri turbans were raised in two points above their foreheads was in taste.

The merchants traded. To show no glimpse of its crew. It was not to the tavern - keepers of Dylath - Leen. To the grocers. Not a piece of food was sent on board. The merchants took gold and slaves from Parg across the river. That was all they took, those featured merchants and their rowers. They took anything from the butchers and grocers. They took gold. The men of Parg whom they bought by weight. The smlels from those ships which the wind blew in from the docks can not be described.\n###\nDylath-Leen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit of the Giants\u2019 Causeway, and its streets are dark and uninviting. There are many dismal sea-taverns near the myriad wharves, and all the town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on earth. Carter questioned the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of Ngranek on the isle of Oriab, and found that they knew of it well. Ships came from Baharna on that island, one being due to return thither in only a month, and Ngranek is but two days\u2019 zebra-ride from that port. But few had seen the stone face of the god, because it is on a very difficult side of Ngranek, which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava. Once the gods were angered with men on that side, and spoke of the matter to the Other Gods. It was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in Dylath-Leen\u2019s sea-taverns, because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys. One of them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown shore, and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock. The mouths of the men who came from it to trade were too wide, and the way their turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste. And their shoes were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the Six Kingdoms. But worst of all was the matter of the unseen rowers. Those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and vigorously to be comfortable, and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded, yet to give no glimpse of its crew. It was not fair to the tavern-keepers of Dylath-Leen, or to the grocers and butchers, either; for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard. The merchants took only gold and stout black slaves from Parg across the river. That was all they ever took, those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers; never anything from the butchers and grocers, but only gold and the fat black men of Parg whom they bought by the pound. And the odours from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described."}

When I looked behind me, I thought I saw a gleam of light near the [THING] I had escaped from. Anxious to leave Washington Street, I started a quiet jog, hoping not to meet any watching eyes. At the corner of Babson Street, I saw with alarm that one [THING] was still lived in, shown by curtains at the [THING]. But there were no lights inside, and I passed it safely. At In Babson Street, which crossed Fdeeral. Might show me to the searchers, I stayed as close as possible to the sagging, uneven buildings. I paused in a doorway twice when the noises behind me grew louder for a moment. The open space ahead shone wide and empty under the [THING]. But my path would not make me cross it. During my second pause, I began to notice a new pattern in the vague sounds. Looking out carefully from my cover, I saw a motor - [THING] speeding across the open space. It was going outward along Eliot Street, which there crosses both Babson and Lafayette. As I watched, the fishy smell suddenly rose again after a short break. I saw a band of rough, crouching shapes loping and shuffling in the same direction. I knew this must be the group guarding the Ipswich [THING], since that highway is an extension of Eliot Street. Two of the figures I saw wore large robes. One wore a pointed crown that shone white in moonlight. This figure 's walk was so strange it chilled me. It seemed the creature was almost hopping. When the last of the band was out of sight, I moved on. I dashed around the corner into Lafayette Street and crossed Eliot very quickly. I feared stragglers of the group might still be coming along that [THING]. I did hear some croaking. Clattering sounds far off toward Town Square. I got across safely. My greatest fear was crossing the wide, moonlit South Street, which had a view of the [THING]. I had to prepare myself for this trial. Someone might easily be looking. Possible Eliot Street stragglers would suerly see me from either of two points.\n###\nStarting once more, I crossed the street to the right-hand side in order to edge around into Babson as inconspicuously as possible. Noises still continued in Federal Street, and as I glanced behind me I thought I saw a gleam of light near the building through which I had escaped. Anxious to leave Washington Street, I broke into a quiet dog-trot, trusting to luck not to encounter any observing eye. Next the corner of Babson Street I saw to my alarm that one of the houses was still inhabited, as attested by curtains at the window; but there were no lights within, and I passed it without disaster. In Babson Street, which crossed Federal and might thus reveal me to the searchers, I clung as closely as possible to the sagging, uneven buildings; twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased. The open space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon, but my route would not force me to cross it. During my second pause I began to detect a fresh distribution of the vague sounds; and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor-car darting across the open space, bound outward along Eliot Street, which there intersects both Babson and Lafayette. As I watched\u2014choked by a sudden rise in the fishy odour after a short abatement\u2014I saw a band of uncouth, crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction; and knew that this must be the party guarding the Ipswich road, since that highway forms an extension of Eliot Street. Two of the figures I glimpsed were in voluminous robes, and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight. The gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through me\u2014for it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping. When the last of the band was out of sight I resumed my progress; darting around the corner into Lafayette Street, and crossing Eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare. I did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward Town Square, but accomplished the passage without disaster. My greatest dread was in re-crossing broad and moonlit South Street\u2014with its seaward view\u2014and I had to nerve myself for the ordeal. Someone might easily be looking, and possible Eliot Street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points."}

It might exist only in his mind. Perhaps his own half - understood brain contained that mysterious connection. This link could wake him to older and future lives in forgotten dimensions. It could tie him to the stars. To the endless spaces. Times beyond them. You ask me to explain why I fear a current of cool air. They ask why I shiver more than othesr when entering a cold [THING]. They ask why I feel sick. Repelled when evening 's chill spreads through a warm autumn day. Some say I reatc to cold as others do to a bad smell. I do not deny this impression. What I will do is tell the most horrible event I ever experienced. You can judge if this explains my peculiar fear. It is wrong to think horror only exists with darkness, silence, and being alone. I found it in the bright light of afternoon. I found it in the noise of a big [THING]. I found it in a crowded, shabby, and ordinary boarding [THING]. A plain landlady and two strong men wree with me. In the spring of 1923, I had some dull. Poorly paid magazine work in New York. I could not pay high rent. So I moved from one cheap boarding [THING] to another. I looked for a [THING] that was decently clean, had bearable furniture. Was very low cost. I soon saw I only had a choice between bad options. But after a while, I found a [THING] on West Fourteenth Street. It disgusted me much less than the others I had tried. The [THING] was a four - story brownstone mansion. It seemed to be from the late 1840s. It had woodwork and marble. Their stained and dirty beauty suggested a fall from a high level of tasteful wealth. The rooms were large and high. They had ugly wallpaper and very fancy plaster moldinsg. A sad musty smell and a hint of strange cooking lingered. But the floors were clean. The bed sheets were fairly normal. The hot [THING] was not too often cold or shut off. I began to see it as a bearable place to stay dormant until I could really live again.\n###\nIt might be in the visible world, yet it might be only in his mind and soul. Perhaps he held within his own half-explored brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions; which would bind him to the stars, and to the infinities and eternities beyond them. You ask me to explain why I am afraid of a draught of cool air; why I shiver more than others upon entering a cold room, and seem nauseated and repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a mild autumn day. There are those who say I respond to cold as others do to a bad odour, and I am the last to deny the impression. What I will do is to relate the most horrible circumstance I ever encountered, and leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable explanation of my peculiarity. It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness, silence, and solitude. I found it in the glare of mid-afternoon, in the clangour of a metropolis, and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace rooming-house with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side. In the spring of 1923 I had secured some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of New York; and being unable to pay any substantial rent, began drifting from one cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might combine the qualities of decent cleanliness, endurable furnishings, and very reasonable price. It soon developed that I had only a choice between different evils, but after a time I came upon a house in West Fourteenth Street which disgusted me much less than the others I had sampled. The place was a four-story mansion of brownstone, dating apparently from the late forties, and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of tasteful opulence. In the rooms, large and lofty, and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices, there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the floors were clean, the linen tolerably regular, and the hot water not too often cold or turned off, so that I came to regard it as at least a bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again."}

It told of the discovery of the heated laundry room. The writer stated it was a most unusual shelter. It was a safe place quite beyond the ability of outsiders to properly value. Whether its warmth was natural or mechanical only a regular user could decide. The process of deciding would be greatly slowed by its changing condition. Winter and the city's weather are not friendly to scuh safe places. This is especially true when their construction is as weak. Temporary as seemed to be the case here. Within the room's moist air, one could feel a widespread heat carrying a smell of soap. Other smells were mixed in. No doubt some earlier customer's laundry soap, left in the machines. Hanging in the air as a ghostly reminder. In commenting on the quality of the laundry room's warmth, my friend suggested a playful comparison. Or rather, he expressed a funny wonder about how it would affect his correspondent. But he was too absorbed in comfort to waste many words on joking. The heated laundry room, he wrote, would be found waiting.

The victim had been seen after midnight. The dawn showed the thing. The manager of a circus in the town of Bolton was questioned. But he swore no animal had escaped from its cage. Those who found the body saw a trail of blood leading to the receiving tomb. A pool of lay on the concrete outside the gate. A fainter trail led toward the woods, but it ended. The night, devils danced on the roofs of Arkham. madness howled in the wind. A cures had crept through the town. Some said it was than the plague. Some whispered it was the demon - soul of the plague itself. Eight houses were entered by nameless thing. It left death behind it. In all, seventeen damaged. remains of bodies were left by the, monster that moved about. A people had seen it in the dark. They said it was and like a ape or a human - fiend. It had not left all that it had attacked, for it had been. The number it had killed was fourteen. Three of the bodies had been in homes and had not been.\n###\nOnly an open window told what had become of our assailant, and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made. There were some strange garments in the room, but West upon regaining consciousness said they did not belong to the stranger, but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases. He ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace. To the police we both declared ignorance of our late companion\u2019s identity. He was, West nervously said, a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar of uncertain location. We had all been rather jovial, and West and I did not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted down. That same night saw the beginning of the second Arkham horror\u2014the horror that to me eclipsed the plague itself. Christchurch Cemetery was the scene of a terrible killing; a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only too hideous for description, but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the deed. The victim had been seen alive considerably after midnight\u2014the dawn revealed the unutterable thing. The manager of a circus at the neighbouring town of Bolton was questioned, but he swore that no beast had at any time escaped from its cage. Those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to the receiving tomb, where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the gate. A fainter trail led away toward the woods, but it soon gave out. The next night devils danced on the roofs of Arkham, and unnatural madness howled in the wind. Through the fevered town had crept a curse which some said was greater than the plague, and which some whispered was the embodied daemon-soul of the plague itself. Eight houses were entered by a nameless thing which strewed red death in its wake\u2014in all, seventeen maimed and shapeless remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless, sadistic monster that crept abroad. A few persons had half seen it in the dark, and said it was white and like a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend. It had not left behind quite all that it had attacked, for sometimes it had been hungry. The number it had killed was fourteen; three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive."}

This seemed to me one of them. My hand shook, but I dug. After a while I stood in the hole I had made. As the hole got, the smell grew. The hole was six feet. I lost all doubt about my touching the thing. Its releases had cursed the house for over a hundred and fifty years. I wondered what it would look like. I wondered what its form and substance would be. I wondered how it might have grown through ages of life -. I climbed out of the hole and spread the piled - up dirt. I placed the acid bottles and near two sides. I could empty them all down the opening one after another when needed. After that I dumped earht along the two sides.

My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in the large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was about six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had cursed the house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would look like\u2014what its form and substance would be, and how big it might have waxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the hole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging the great carboys of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty them all down the aperture in quick succession. After that I dumped earth only along the other two sides; working more slowly and donning my gas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit. Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the light of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was fishy and glassy\u2014a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was a rift where a part of the substance was folded over. The exposed area was huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft blue-white stovepipe doubled in two, its largest part some two feet in diameter. Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and away from the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting the heavy carboys, and precipitating their corrosive contents one after another down that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality whose titan elbow I had seen. The blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow vapour which surged tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended, will never leave my memory. All along the hill people tell of the yellow day, when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped in the Providence River, but I know how mistaken they are as to the source."}

When Perkins decided to face the strange record of his money accounts, he did not go to the polished space of his mahogany desk. Instead, he walked out the oak door and across the worn carpet. He went toward a tall cabinet he saw through the darkness of a hallway that sloped up to the attic stairs. In time, he reached a large stack of papers. A drawer with a small brass key. When he turned the lock, what slid out to meet him was not an orderly, explained statement from the bank. It was a messy pile of crumpled receipts and forgotten invoices. They spoke as best they could in the secret notes of distant business. And Perkins spread the worrying documents under the yellow light of a single bulb. They were among calculations as Byzantine as possible to human math. He called up the forgotten totals from accounts arranged as in some ancient financial district. At the ledger, surrounded by ink-stained tools in the old style, he was met by a pale calculator of questionable reliability. He soon was deep in the coulmns. There, Perkins, Lord of his own small world. The numbers about his financial health, sat thoughtful before the lined pages. They looked at his shrinking number reserves. They wished his bank teller would come in and scold him. This was because he was not prepared for that hated monthly calculation at the statement's end.

I had a hunger of such size that any food was better than being exposed. I had been saving money for some time in the aisles of the local market. I was looking for certain financial information. Because my budget was remote, tricky. Problematic, I thought it best to use a shopping cart, even though it was late. Now I stood before a shelf that seemed abandoned. I had chosen it as the shortest path to food. The hunger pains hit me at a spot far from any bakery. I saw no food except an and cardboard container. It blinked with blurred writing from between two bright boxes of the name-brand tpye near the bottom of a metal rack. Distant though it was from the remains of a sensible breakafst, the cereal still gave me a feeling the moment I saw it. Honest, healthy foods do not stare at shoppers so sneakily and hauntingly. In my money research, I had heard stories from decade before that made me distrust products of this kind. Yet the power of my emptiness was enough to overcome my doubts. I did not hesitate to push my cart down the linoleum aisle to the closed box. It seemed both suggestive and secretive at once.\n###\nIt was to a time-battered box of this description that I was driven one morning in November, by a hunger of such chilling copiousness that any sustenance was preferable to exposure. I had been economizing for some time amongst the aisles of the local market in quest of certain fiscal data; and from the remote, devious, and problematical nature of my budget, had deemed it convenient to employ a shopping cart despite the lateness of the hour. Now I found myself before an apparently abandoned shelf which I had chosen as the shortest cut to nourishment; overtaken by the pangs at a point far from any bakery, and confronted with no provender save the antique and repellent cardboard container which blinked with bleared lettering from between two huge garish boxes of the name-brand sort near the foot of a metallic rack. Distant though it was from the remnant of a sensible breakfast, the cereal none the less impressed me unfavourably the very moment I espied it. Honest, wholesome comestibles do not stare at shoppers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my economic researches I had encountered legends of a decade before which biassed me against products of this kind. Yet the force of my emptiness was such as to overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to wheel my cart down the linoleum aisle to the closed box which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive."}

The reason appeared later. It was learned from gardening books that he had probably found an important lack. His attention had suddenly moved form watering the aspidistra to watering one nephthytis. This chaneg was explained when, upon checking the soil that he had checked, the homeowner actually noticed a partial pattern of wtaer loss. This had escaped general notice. It stated that the curious clay pot had been dry \"three days since the last. Complete soaking of the nephthytis in the\u2014\". The absence of a set watering-plan in the remaining note made the job very hard. The nephthytis's thirst seemed as hard to understand as that of the aspidistra. But here no regular neglect had happened. One might fairly be expected to find the wetness itself even if its record had been lost. Hence the inspections. The sansevieria and the old philodendron in the middle of the sun-room were left out. This was because other plant information had shown that the only nephthytis whose watering could have been meant was a type with a tendency to live in shade.\n###\nLate in March Wilson added to his horticultural regimen a meticulous series of inspections about the various potted specimens of the apartment. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from gardening manuals that he had probably discovered an important deficiency. His attention had suddenly shifted from the watering of the aspidistra to that of one nephthytis; and this shift was explained when, upon examining the soil that he had examined, the householder actually detected a fragmentary pattern of moisture-loss which had escaped the general observation, and which stated that the curious terracotta vessel had been parched \u201cthree days since the last and thorough saturation of the nephthytis in the\u2014\u201d. The lack of a specified watering-schedule in the surviving notation greatly complicated the task, and the nephthytis\u2019s thirst seemed as inscrutable as that of the aspidistra; but here no systematic neglect had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the dampness itself even if its record had perished.

Here his only visible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles, bags, or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed \u201cchymist\u201d\u2014by which they meant alchemist\u2014would not be long in finding the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. The nearest neighbours to this farm\u2014the Fenners, a quarter of a mile away\u2014had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries, they said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large number of livestock which thronged the pastures, for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat, milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers. Then, too, there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows. Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwen\u2019s town house in Olney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition."}

The gardener's helper did it, following the owner's order. The hose, because I urged it, did not fight. It, my scissors, my small shovel, and I went through short process. The other tools were rough, forgotten things from the shed. The equipment had satyed in the old, low corner near the end of the stone path. It planned to stay there after a short trip to the faucet. From there a small flow of water. Mineral buildup were to be pushed out. It was probably not so much care for the grass and its keeper. It was more a personal wish to be near the tap, its handle. Its group of \"drops\".

I did manage to hear the old muet [THING] play at night. At first, I walked quietly to my old fifth [THING]. Tehn I became brave enough to climb the last noisy stairs to the top attic. In the narrow hall, outside the locked [THING] with the covered keyhole, I often heard sounds. These sounds filled me with a fear I could not explain. It was a fear of strange wonder and deep mystery. The sounds were not ugly. But they had vibrations that seemed not of this [THING]. At times, they became like a symphony. I could hardly believe one player made them. Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius of wild power. As weeks passed, the playing grew wilder. The old musician looked more tired and secretive. It was sad to see. He now refused to let me in at any time. He avoided me when we met on the stairs. One night, I listened at the [THING]. I heard the screaming violin grow into a chaotic mix of sound. It was a noise that would make me doubt my own mind. But from behind the barred [THING] came a pitiful proof the horror was real. It was a terrible, wordless cry. Only a mute [THING] can make such a cry. It comes only in moments of great fear or pain. I knocked on the [THING] many times. There was no answer. Afterward I waited in dark hallway. I shook from cold and fear. Then I heard the poor musician weakly try to get up from the [THING] using a [THING]. Believing him just awake after fainting, I knocked again. At the same time, I called out my name to calm him. I heard Zann stumble to the [THING]. He closed both the shutter and the [THING]. Then he stumbled to the [THING]. He unlocked it with shaking hands to let me in. This time, his happiness at having me there was real. His twisted [THING] showed relief. He held onto my coat like a [THING] holding its mother 's skirt. Shaking in a sad way, the old [THING] pushed me into a [THING]. He sank into another [THING]. His violin and bow lay carelessly on the [THING] beside it. He sat without moving for some time. He nodded in a strange way. But he also seemed to be listening very hard and with fear.\n###\nWhat I did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man. At first I would tiptoe up to my old fifth floor, then I grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the peaked garret. There in the narrow hall, outside the bolted door with the covered keyhole, I often heard sounds which filled me with an indefinable dread\u2014the dread of vague wonder and brooding mystery. It was not that the sounds were hideous, for they were not; but that they held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth, and that at certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which I could hardly conceive as produced by one player. Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius of wild power. As the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold. He now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me whenever we met on the stairs. Then one night as I listened at the door I heard the shrieking viol swell into a chaotic babel of sound; a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was real\u2014the awful, inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter, and which rises only in moments of the most terrible fear or anguish. I knocked repeatedly at the door, but received no response. Afterward I waited in the black hallway, shivering with cold and fear, till I heard the poor musician\u2019s feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair. Believing him just conscious after a fainting fit, I renewed my rapping, at the same time calling out my name reassuringly. I heard Zann stumble to the window and close both shutter and sash, then stumble to the door, which he falteringly unfastened to admit me. This time his delight at having me present was real; for his distorted face gleamed with relief while he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its mother\u2019s skirts. Shaking pathetically, the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank into another, beside which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the floor. He sat for some time inactive, nodding oddly, but having a paradoxical suggestion of intense and frightened listening."}

I would not let myself think about what endless caves of forever night mihgt wait below. Later, I crawled along a poorly built part of the hallway. I reached a spot where the roof had completely fallen in. The wreckage was piled like a [THING]. I climbed over it. I passed through a huge empty area. My torchlight could not show any walls or arched [THING] there. I thought this must be the basement of the [THING] sellers ' [THING]. It faced the third square not far from the record halls. I could not guess what had happened to it. I found the hallway again on the other side of the [THING] of trash. But after a short distance, I met a completely blocked place. The fallen arcehd [THING] almost touched the dangerously drooping roof above. I do not know how I forced. Pulled aside enough [THING] blcoks to make a path. I do not know how I dared to move the tightly packed pieces. The smallest change in balance could have made all the tons of [THING] above fall. Crush me to nothing. It was pure madness that pushed and led me. That is, if my whole trip underground was not just a hellish false vision. dream, which I hope it was. But I did make, or dream I made, a passage I could squeeze through. As I wriggled over the pile of wreckage, I held my torch in my mouth. It was switched on the whole time. I felt myself cut by the sharp, hanging points of the rough [THING] above me. I was now near the great underground record [THING]. It seemed to be my goal. Sliding and I climbed down the far side of the barrier. I moved carefully along the last part of the hallway. I held my torch, which flashed on and off. I finally reached a low, round [THING] with arches. The arches opened on all sides. They were still in amazingly good shap.e The walls, or the parts my torchlight could reach, were covered with carved picture writing. They had the usual curved symbols. Some symbols had been added since the time of my dreams. I knew this was my planned stopping place. I turned at once through a knwon archway on my left. Strangely, I had almost no doubt I could find a clear path up. Down the slope to all the levels still there. This huge, [THING] - protected [THING] held the records of the whole solar system. It was built with amazing skill. Strength to last as long as the system itself.\n###\nNow it lay open\u2014black and yawning, and giving forth a current of cool, damp air. Of what limitless caverns of eternal night might brood below, I would not permit myself to think. Later, clawing my way along a badly heaped section of the corridor, I reached a place where the roof had wholly caved in. The debris rose like a mountain, and I climbed up over it, passing through a vast empty space where my torchlight could reveal neither walls nor vaulting. This, I reflected, must be the cellar of the house of the metal-purveyors, fronting on the third square not far from the archives. What had happened to it I could not conjecture. I found the corridor again beyond the mountain of detritus and stones, but after a short distance encountered a wholly choked place where the fallen vaulting almost touched the perilously sagging ceiling. How I managed to wrench and tear aside enough blocks to afford a passage, and how I dared disturb the tightly packed fragments when the least shift of equilibrium might have brought down all the tons of superincumbent masonry to crush me to nothingness, I do not know. It was sheer madness that impelled and guided me\u2014if, indeed, my whole underground adventure was not\u2014as I hope\u2014a hellish delusion or phase of dreaming. But I did make\u2014or dream that I made\u2014a passage that I could squirm through. As I wriggled over the mound of debris\u2014my torch, switched continuously on, thrust deeply within my mouth\u2014I felt myself torn by the fantastic stalactites of the jagged floor above me. I was now close to the great underground archival structure which seemed to form my goal. Sliding and clambering down the farther side of the barrier, and picking my way along the remaining stretch of corridor with hand-held, intermittently flashing torch, I came at last to a low, circular crypt with arches\u2014still in a marvellous state of preservation\u2014opening off on every side. The walls, or such parts of them as lay within reach of my torchlight, were densely hieroglyphed and chiselled with typical curvilinear symbols\u2014some added since the period of my dreams. This, I realised, was my fated destination, and I turned at once through a familiar archway on my left. That I could find a clear passage up and down the incline to all the surviving levels, I had oddly little doubt. This vast, earth-protected pile, housing the annals of all the solar system, had been built with supernal skill and strength to last as long as that system itself."}

Professor Webb had been engaged, forty - eight years, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland. He was searching for some inscriptions. He failed to find them. While on the West Greenland coast he met a tribe or cult. They were Esquimaux. Their religion was a form of devil - worship. It chilled him with its bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith that Esquimaux knew about. They mentioned it with shudders. They said it had come down from ages. It existed before the world was made. Besides nameless rites and sacrifices, there were queer rituals. These were addressed to a devil or tornasuk. Professor Webb had taken a copy of this. He got it from an angekok or wizard - priest.

Its vast, awesome, and incalculable age was unmistakable; yet not one link did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisation\u2019s youth\u2014or indeed to any other time. Totally separate and apart, its very material was a mystery; for the soapy, greenish-black stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy.

They, like the subject and material, belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it; something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part. And yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the Inspector\u2019s problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs."}

When he climbed out of the crack, a morning mist was gathering. But he saw the and cottage. Its walls were as the rock. Its peak stood against the whtie of the seaward vapors. He saw that there was no door on this end. There were a couple of lattice windows with panes set in lead in - century style. around him was cloud and confusion.

The emptiness of the air on the.\n###\nSouth of him the frightful precipice above Kingsport, north of him the vertical drop of nearly a mile to the river\u2019s mouth. Suddenly a great chasm opened before him, ten feet deep, so that he had to let himself down by his hands and drop to a slanting floor, and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in the opposite wall. So this was the way the folk of the uncanny house journeyed betwixt earth and sky! When he climbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering, but he clearly saw the lofty and unhallowed cottage ahead; walls as grey as the rock, and high peak standing bold against the milky white of the seaward vapours. And he perceived that there was no door on this landward end, but only a couple of small lattice windows with dingy bull\u2019s-eye panes leaded in seventeenth-century fashion. All around him was cloud and chaos, and he could see nothing below but the whiteness of illimitable space. He was alone in the sky with this queer and very disturbing house; and when he sidled around to the front and saw that the wall stood flush with the cliff\u2019s edge, so that the single narrow door was not to be reached save from the empty aether, he felt a distinct terror that altitude could not wholly explain. And it was very odd that shingles so worm-eaten could survive, or bricks so crumbled still form a standing chimney. As the mist thickened, Olney crept around to the windows on the north and west and south sides, trying them but finding them all locked. He was vaguely glad they were locked, because the more he saw of that house the less he wished to get in. Then a sound halted him. He heard a lock rattle and bolt shoot, and a long creaking follow as if a heavy door were slowly and cautiously opened. This was on the oceanward side that he could not see, where the narrow portal opened on blank space thousands of feet in the misty sky above the waves. Then there was heavy, deliberate tramping in the cottage, and Olney heard the windows opening, first on the north side opposite him, and then on the west just around the corner. Next would come the south windows, under the great low eaves on the side where he stood; and it must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other."}

That ship did not go as Carter had worried, because he saw that the pilot was steering for the moon. The moon was a shape, shining. as they got. Showing its holes. points in a way. The ship headed for the side. It became that its goal was hidden. side which is turned form the earth. Which no person, except the dreamer Snireth - Ko, has seen. The view of the moon as the ship came was to Carter. He did not like the size. Shape of the buildings which lay fallen. The temples on the mountains were placed in such a way that they could not have honored any good. In the patterns of the stone posts seemed to hide some dark. meaning which did not want to be understood. What the build. Size of the worshipers could have been, Carter would not guess. When the ship went around the edge. Sailed over those lands by man, there showed in the land signs of life. Carter saw,, houess in fields of growths. He noticed that these houses had no windows. Thought that their shape made him think of the huts of Esquimaux. he saw the waves of a sea. Knew that the trip was to be by water\u2014. At through some liquid. The ship hit the surface with a sound. The way the waves took it was to Carter. They moved at speed, passing. Calling to another ship of form. seeing nothing. That sea. A sky that was. of stars though the sun shone in it. There rose ahead the hills of a - looking coast. Carter saw the towers of a city. The way they leaned. Curved, the way they were grouepd. The fact that thye had no windows, was to the prisoner. He regretted the foolishness which had made him drink the wine of that merchant with the hat.\n###\nThese are the nameless larvae of the Other Gods, and like them are blind and without mind, and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts. But that offensive galley did not aim as far as Carter had feared, for he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon. The moon was a crescent, shining larger and larger as they approached it, and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably. The ship made for the edge, and it soon became clear that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from the earth, and which no fully human person, save perhaps the dreamer Snireth-Ko, has ever beheld. The close aspect of the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to Carter, and he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there. The dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no wholesome or suitable gods, and in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to lurk some dark and inner meaning which did not invite solution. And what the structure and proportions of the olden worshippers could have been, Carter steadily refused to conjecture. When the ship rounded the edge, and sailed over those lands unseen by man, there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life, and Carter saw many low, broad, round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi. He noticed that these cottages had no windows, and thought that their shape suggested the huts of Esquimaux. Then he glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea, and knew that the voyage was once more to be by water\u2014or at least through some liquid. The galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound, and the odd elastic way the waves received it was very perplexing to Carter. They now slid along at great speed, once passing and hailing another galley of kindred form, but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea and a sky that was black and star-strown even though the sun shone scorchingly in it. There presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast, and Carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they leaned and bent, the manner in which they were clustered, and the fact that they had no windows at all, was very disturbing to the prisoner; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban."}

We doubted whether that strong smell the dogs hated could cause equal dislike in tehse penguins. Their ancestors had clearly lived very well with the Old Ones. This friendly relationship must have lasted in the abyss beolw as long as any Old Ones remained. We felt regret, in a return of old pure science spirit, that we could not photograph these odd creatures. We soon left them to their squawking. We pushed on toward the abyss. Its openness was now so clearly proven to us. Occasional penguin tracks showed its exact direction. Not long after, a steep drop in a long, low, doorless. Strangely carving-less hall made us think we were nearing the tunnel mouth at last. We passed two more penguins. We heard others right ahead. Then the hall ended in a huge open space. It made us gasp without thinking. It was a perfcet upside-down bowl shape, clearly deep underground. It was fully a hundred feet across and fifty feet high. Low archways opened around all parts of the edge except one. That one opened like a huge cave with a black arched opening. It broke the curve of the roof to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was the entrance to the great abyss. In this huge bowl, whsoe curved roof was carved to look like the ancient sky dome, a few white penguins wdadled. They were outsiders there, but they did not care and did not see. The black tunnel opened steeply downward without clear end. Its opening was decorated with oddly carved side posts and top beam. From that mysterious mouth we imagined a slightly warmer air current came. Maybe even a hint of steam came out. We wondered what living things, besides penguins, the endless space below might hide. Also, the connected honeycomb areas of the land and giant mountains might hide things. We also wondered if the trace of mountain-top smoke first suspected by poor Lake was caused by this. Also, the odd haze we saw around the wall-topped peak might be caused by it. It might be from twisting channels rising form unexplored regions of earth's core. Entering the tunnel, we saw its size was, at least at the start, about fifteen feet in each direction. The sides, floor, and arched roof were made of the usual giant stonework. The sides had few decorations. They were standard designs in a late, declining style. All the building and carving were amazingly well preserved.\n###\nWe doubted whether that pungent odour which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins; since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms with the Old Ones\u2014an amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained. Regretting\u2014in a flareup of the old spirit of pure science\u2014that we could not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clear. Not long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and peculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnel-mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins, and heard others immediately ahead. Then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us gasp involuntarily\u2014a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep underground; fully an hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and that one yawning cavernously with a black arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was the entrance to the great abyss. In this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though decadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few albino penguins waddled\u2014aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing. The black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep descending grade, its aperture adorned with grotesquely chiselled jambs and lintel. From that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air and perhaps even a suspicion of vapour proceeded; and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void below, and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, might conceal. We wondered, too, whether the trace of mountain-top smoke at first suspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by the tortuous-channelled rising of some such vapour from the unfathomed regions of earth\u2019s core. Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was\u2014at least at the start\u2014about fifteen feet each way; sides, floor, and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely decorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a late, decadent style; and all the construction and carving were marvellously well preserved."}

He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him.

Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house\u2014a spacious, peaked-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry seemed to shew the effects of sound calculation. It had already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman. His mania shewed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section\u2014though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all. Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson\u2014a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story. This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms."}

Admitted confusion at the accountant's problem, there was one man in that office. He suspected a hint of recognition in the monstrous columns and numbers. He then told somewhat shyly of the thing he knew. This person was the late Alistair P. Whateley, Professor of Fiscal Antiquities in Miskatonic University, and an auditor of some importance. Professor Whateley had been hired, forty-eight years before, to examine books and receipts. He was looking for some mysterious differences which he could not explain. inside the storage rooms of the Arkham Merchants' Bank he found a book. Record of bookkeepers. Their methods, a curious kind of number magic, chilled him with its purposeful hiding. It was a practice about which other accountants knew They mentioned it only with shakes, saying it had come from horribly ages before double-entry bookkeeping was even thought of. Besides unnmaed fees and ghost deductions there were certain family rituals. These were directed to a suprmee ledger or dread book. Proefssor Whateley had made a careful copy from an insurance expert or wizard-clerk. He wrote amounts in Arabic numbers as best he could. But just now of main importance was the code which this group had valued. They worked around it when the gaslights burned over the tlal desks. It was, the professor said, a quite simple setup of numbers. It included a total and some secret notes. As far as he could tell, it was a rough match in all key points to the beastly paper now lying before the meeting.\n###\nAnd yet, as the clerks severally shook their heads and confessed bewilderment at the accountant\u2019s quandary, there was one man in that office who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous columns and figures, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late Alistair P. Whateley, Professor of Fiscal Antiquities in Miskatonic University, and an auditor of no slight note. Professor Whateley had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a review of ledgers and receipts in search of some arcane discrepancies which he failed to reconcile; and whilst deep within the vaults of the old Arkham Merchants\u2019 Bank had encountered a singular tome or record of degenerate bookkeepers whose methods, a curious form of numerical devilry, chilled him with its deliberate obfuscation and repulsiveness. It was a practice of which other accountants knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever double-entry bookkeeping was conceived. Besides nameless fees and phantom deductions there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder ledger or dread folio; and of this Professor Whateley had taken a careful transcript from an aged actuary or wizard-clerk, expressing the sums in Arabic numerals as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance was the cipher which this cult had cherished, and around which they labored when the gaslights flickered low over the high desks. It was, the professor stated, a very crude arrangement of digits, comprising a hideous total and some cryptic notations. And so far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial document now lying before the meeting."}

The history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed no trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the prosperous and honourable family who built it. Yet from the first a taint of calamity, soon increased to boding significance, was apparent. My uncle\u2019s carefully compiled record began with the building of the structure in 1763, and followed the theme with an unusual amount of detail. The shunned house, it seems, was first inhabited by William Harris and his wife Rhoby Dexter, with their children, Elkanah, born in 1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William, Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, born in 1761. Harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the West India trade, connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. After Brown\u2019s death in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown & Co. made him master of the brig Prudence, Providence-built, of 120 tons, thus enabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since his marriage. The site he had chosen\u2014a recently straightened part of the new and fashionable Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill above crowded Cheapside\u2014was all that could be wished, and the building did justice to the location. It was the best that moderate means could afford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child which the family expected. That child, a boy, came in December; but was still-born. Nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a century and a half. The next April sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail and Ruth died before the month was over. Dr. Job Ives diagnosed the trouble as some infantile fever, though others declared it was more of a mere wasting-away or decline. It seemed, in any event, to be contagious; for Hannah Bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the following June. Eli Liddeason, the other servant, constantly complained of weakness; and would have returned to his father\u2019s farm in Rehoboth but for a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was hired to succeed Hannah."}

Red Aldebaran moves low around the horizon, there has been nothing. [THING] for thousands of years. They say there has nveer been a [THING] there except short yellow creatures, harmed by the cold, whom they call \" Esquimaux \". I have often wondered if most [THING] ever stop to think about the sometimes huge importance of dreams. Of the hidden world to which they belong. Whilst most of our night visions are perhaps only weak. Strange copies of our waking experiencesthere are still some left whose unearthly. Light character allows no normal explanation. Their vaguely exciting. Worrying effect suggests possible small looks into a world of mental life no less important than physical life. Separated from that life by a nearly impassable [THING]. From my experience I can not doubt that [THING], when lost to [THING] consciousness, is truly staying in anohter. Bodiless life of a very difefrent nature from the life we know. Only the smallest and most unclear memories remain after waking. From those unclear and broken memories we can guess much, yet prove little. We may guess that in dreams, life, matter. Energy, as the [THING] knows such things, are not always constant. We may guess that time. Space do not exist as our waking selves understand them. Sometimes I believe that this less physical life is our truer life. That our useless presence on the [THING]. Earth golbe is itself the secondary. Only seeming event. It was from a young daydream filled with thoughts of this kind that I got up one afternoon in the winter of 1900\u20131901. At that time, to the state mental hospital where I worked as a trainee doctor, was brought the [THING] whose case has haunted me. Constantly ever since. His name, as written on the records, was Joe Slater, or Slaader. His appearance was that of the typical [THING] from the Catskill Mountain area. He was one of those strange, ugly children of an early settler farmer family. Their separation for almost three hundred years in the hilly strongholds of a little - visited countryside has caused them to fall into a kind of savage decline, rather than improve with their more lucky brothers in the heavily populated areas.\n###\nThey say there is no land of Lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the Pole Star shines high and red Aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call \u201cEsquimaux\u201d. I have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which they belong. Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences\u2014Freud to the contrary with his puerile symbolism\u2014there are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation, and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life, yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier. From my experience I cannot doubt but that man, when lost to terrestrial consciousness, is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know; and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking. From those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much, yet prove little. We may guess that in dreams life, matter, and vitality, as the earth knows such things, are not necessarily constant; and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend them. Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon. It was from a youthful reverie filled with speculations of this sort that I arose one afternoon in the winter of 1900\u20131901, when to the state psychopathic institution in which I served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly. His name, as given on the records, was Joe Slater, or Slaader, and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the Catskill Mountain region; one of those strange, repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of a little-travelled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy, rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts."}

There were some large square Georgian houses, too, with hipped roofs, cupolas, and railed \u201cwidow\u2019s walks\u201d. These were mostly well back from the water, and one or two seemed to be in moderately sound condition. Stretching inland from among them I saw the rusted, grass-grown line of the abandoned railway, with leaning telegraph-poles now devoid of wires, and the half-obscured lines of the old carriage roads to Rowley and Ipswich. The decay was worst close to the waterfront, though in its very midst I could spy the white belfry of a fairly well-preserved brick structure which looked like a small factory. The harbour, long clogged with sand, was enclosed by an ancient stone breakwater; on which I could begin to discern the minute forms of a few seated fishermen, and at whose end were what looked like the foundations of a bygone lighthouse. A sandy tongue had formed inside this barrier, and upon it I saw a few decrepit cabins, moored dories, and scattered lobster-pots. The only deep water seemed to be where the river poured out past the belfried structure and turned southward to join the ocean at the breakwater\u2019s end. Here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness, those farthest south seeming the most decayed. And far out at sea, despite a high tide, I glimpsed a long, black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy. This, I knew, must be Devil Reef. As I looked, a subtle, curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion; and oddly enough, I found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression. We met no one on the road, but presently began to pass deserted farms in varying stages of ruin. Then I noticed a few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in the broken windows and shells and dead fish lying about the littered yards. Once or twice I saw listless-looking people working in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishy-smelling beach below, and groups of dirty, simian-visaged children playing around weed-grown doorsteps. Somehow these people seemed more disquieting than the dismal buildings, for almost every one had certain peculiarities of face and motions which I instinctively disliked without being able to define or comprehend them."}

He seemed at the unbroken items again with fresh annoyance. The constant fluorescent light had started to bend their shapes a little. The edges and corners of two or three showed signs of bending. But he did not think there was any danger of thme falling apart right away. This was because of the very clod air inside the refrigerator. He did move all the items thta were not stacked closer together. He threw a spare towel over thme. This was to block the direct electric light. That would also hepl keep their possible bad smell away from the household pets. pets' strange restlessness was becoming a real problem. This was true even though they were quite far away and behind cabinet doors. Those doors were getting higher and higher. More of his determination was working to lcok those doors around pets' space. He had to put heavy ceramic blocks on the corners of the towel. This held it in place against the growing mechanical noise. The giant appliances seemed ready to produce some very serious vibrations. Early fears about sudden temperature shrinkage came back. Under his own watch, steps were taken to protect the containers. The new storage area and the rough shelf dividers were also protected. They were lined with insulating materials on the warmer side. These dividers were started with ancient cardboard during spare moments. They were not nearly as steady as they should have been. He finally stopped all work on other jobs to focus on them.\n###\nAt about 2:30 A.M., having decided to postpone further consumption and secure a little order, he covered the disordered containers with a dishcloth, emerged from the kitchen cabinet, and studied the intact specimens with renewed vexation. The ceaseless fluorescent glare had begun to warp their geometries a trifle, so that the rims and corners of two or three shewed signs of buckling; but he did not believe there was any danger of immediate collapse in the almost arctic air of the refrigeration unit. He did, however, move all the unstacked specimens closer together and throw a spare towel over them in order to keep off the direct electric rays. That would also help to keep their possible olfactory miasma away from the household pets, whose curious unrest was really becoming a problem even at their substantial distance and behind the higher and higher cabinet doors which an increased quota of his resolve was hastening to secure around their repository. He had to weight down the corners of the towel with heavy blocks of ceramic to hold it in place amidst the rising mechanical hum, for the titan appliances seemed about to deliver some gravely severe vibrations. Early apprehensions about sudden thermal contractions were revived, and under his own supervision precautions were taken to bank the containers, new storage zone, and crude shelf partitions with insulating materials on the warmer side. These latter partitions, begun with discarded cardboard during odd moments, were by no means as stable as they should have been; and he finally detached all efforts from other tasks to work on them."}

In other areas the stonework was worn down to the same level as the ice. One wide area, stretching from the inside of the plateau TO a ggap in the foothills about a mile left of the pass we crossed, had no buildings at all.

But when they had a son, all three. the god and the princess returned. When the princess died, her husband preserved her body. He placed it in a stone house where it was worshipped. he left. The legend seemed to have three versions. According According to one story, nothing happened. The goddess became a symbol of power for whichever tribe owned it. The N\u2019bangus took it for this reason. A story told of the god 's return. His death at the feet of his wife. A story told of the reutrn of the son. He had grown to manhood \u2014 or apehood or godhood. He did not know who he was. the people had expanded on any events behind the legends. Arthur Jermyn doubted the reality of the jungle city Sir Wade described. He was not when in 1912 he found what remained of it. Its Its size was. But the stones scattered proved it was not a village. no carvings could be found. The expedition could not clear the one passageway. This passage seemed to lead down into the vault system Sir Wade had mentioned. He discussed the apes and the preserved goddess with all the chiefs. But it was a European who added to the information from Mwanu. M. Verhaeren was agent at a trading post on the Congo. He believed he could find and get the preserved goddess. He had heard stories about it. The N\u2019bangus were servants of King Albert \u2019s government. With a persuasion, they could be made to give up the god they had taken., When Jermyn sailed for England with hope. He expected that within a months he would get a relic. This would confirm the story from his - - - grandfather. That, the story he had heard.\n###\nThe ape-princess, it was said, became the consort of a great white god who had come out of the West. For a long time they had reigned over the city together, but when they had a son all three went away. Later the god and the princess had returned, and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone, where it was worshipped. Then he had departed alone. The legend here seemed to present three variants. According to one story nothing further happened save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it. It was for this reason that the N\u2019bangus carried it off. A second story told of the god\u2019s return and death at the feet of his enshrined wife. A third told of the return of the son, grown to manhood\u2014or apehood or godhood, as the case might be\u2014yet unconscious of his identity. Surely the imaginative blacks had made the most of whatever events might lie behind the extravagant legendry. Of the reality of the jungle city described by old Sir Wade, Arthur Jermyn had no further doubt; and was hardly astonished when early in 1912 he came upon what was left of it. Its size must have been exaggerated, yet the stones lying about proved that it was no mere negro village. Unfortunately no carvings could be found, and the small size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing the one visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults which Sir Wade had mentioned. The white apes and the stuffed goddess were discussed with all the native chiefs of the region, but it remained for a European to improve on the data offered by old Mwanu. M. Verhaeren, Belgian agent at a trading-post on the Congo, believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess, of which he had vaguely heard; since the once mighty N\u2019bangus were now the submissive servants of King Albert\u2019s government, and with but little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had carried off. When Jermyn sailed for England, therefore, it was with the exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his great-great-great-grandfather\u2019s narratives\u2014that is, the wildest which he had ever heard."}

The man came upon me around two on a cloudy August morning. I was moving through a set of separate courtyards. You can only reach them now through dark hallawys of buildings in between. Once they were part of a connected web of pretty alleys. I had heard of them through unclear stories. I knew they would not be on any modern maap. The fact they were forgotten made me love them more. So I had looked for them with twice my normal keenness. Now that I found them, my keenness doubled again. Something about theiir layout faintly suggested they might be just a few of many such places. Others might be dark and silent. They could be squeezed secretly between high blank walls and empty back buildings. Or they might hide without light behind archways. Thhey are not shown by crowds of foreign speakers. They are not guarded by secretive, quiet artists.

I had heard of them by vague rumour, and realised that they could not be upon any map of today; but the fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me, so that I had sought them with twice my usual eagerness. Now that I had found them, my eagerness was again redoubled; for something in their arrangement dimly hinted that they might be only a few of many such, with dark, dumb counterparts wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear tenements, or lurking lamplessly behind archways, unbetrayed by hordes of the foreign-speaking or guarded by furtive and uncommunicative artists whose practices do not invite publicity or the light of day."}

This meant all roads leading out of Innsmouth were watched in the way. The people could not have known which route I planned to take. If this was, I would have to retreat across the countryside from any road. How could I do that, since all the surrounding area was. of creeks? For a moment, my mind spun from hopelessness. From a increase in the - smell. I thought of the abandoned railway to Rowley. Its line of ballasted, weed - covered earth stretched from the crumbling station on the edge of the river gorge. There was a chance the townspeople would not think of it. Its thorn - choked, state made it to pass. It seemed the path for a fugitive to chosoe. I had seen it from my hotel window and knew where it lay. of its length was from the Rowley road. From places in the town. But one might crawl through the undergrowth. At any rate, it was my chance of escape. I had to try it. Drawing inside the hall of my shelter, I looked at the grocery boy 's map with my flashlight. The problem was how to reach the railway. I saw the path was to Babson Street, west to Lafayette. I would go. Not cross an space like the one I had passed through. I would go. West in a zigzag line through Lafayette, Bates, Adams. The street went along the river gorge to the abandoned, run - down station I had seen from my window. My reason for going to Babson was that I did not want to cross the space. I did not want to start my path on a cross street as South. Starting, I crossed the street to the side to slip into Babson as. Noises continued in Federal Street. When I looked behind me, I thought I saw a gleam of light near the building I had escaped from.\n###\nSince the pursuit was down another street, it was plain that the party was not following me directly. It had not seen me, but was simply obeying a general plan of cutting off my escape. This, however, implied that all roads leading out of Innsmouth were similarly patrolled; for the denizens could not have known what route I intended to take. If this were so, I would have to make my retreat across country away from any road; but how could I do that in view of the marshy and creek-riddled nature of all the surrounding region? For a moment my brain reeled\u2014both from sheer hopelessness and from a rapid increase in the omnipresent fishy odour. Then I thought of the abandoned railway to Rowley, whose solid line of ballasted, weed-grown earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge of the river-gorge. There was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that; since its brier-choked desertion made it half-impassable, and the unlikeliest of all avenues for a fugitive to choose. I had seen it clearly from my hotel window, and knew about how it lay. Most of its earlier length was uncomfortably visible from the Rowley road, and from high places in the town itself; but one could perhaps crawl inconspicuously through the undergrowth. At any rate, it would form my only chance of deliverance, and there was nothing to do but try it. Drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter, I once more consulted the grocery boy\u2019s map with the aid of the flashlight. The immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway; and I now saw that the safest course was ahead to Babson Street, then west to Lafayette\u2014there edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one I had traversed\u2014and subsequently back northward and westward in a zigzagging line through Lafayette, Bates, Adams, and Bank Streets\u2014the latter skirting the river-gorge\u2014to the abandoned and dilapidated station I had seen from my window. My reason for going ahead to Babson was that I wished neither to re-cross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as South. Starting once more, I crossed the street to the right-hand side in order to edge around into Babson as inconspicuously as possible. Noises still continued in Federal Street, and as I glanced behind me I thought I saw a gleam of light near the building through which I had escaped."}

We turned to look at the stone shapes below us. They were a, tangle. They were outlined against an sky. As we did this, we saw the sky byeond had lost its morning haziness. The ice vapors had moved up to the top of the sky. Their mocking outlines seemed about to form some pattern. They seemed to make it or., on the horizon behind the city, a, fairy - line of violet peaks was revealed. Their needle - pointed heights appeared dream - against the inviting rose color of the sky. The land sloped up toward this edge. The path of the river crossed it like an ribbon of shadow. For a, we gasped at scene 's, beauty., a horror began to creep into our souls. This violet line could be the mountains of the forbidden land. They are the peaks on Earth and the focus of Earth 's evil. They harbor nameless horrors and secrets. People who fear to understand their meaning avoid them and pray to them. No living thign of Earth has walked. But sinister lightnings visit them. They send beams across the plains in the night. Without doubt, they are the form of that dreaded Kadath in the Cold Waste beyond the hated Leng. legends hint about this vaguely. We were the beings to see them. I hope to God we may be the. If the carved maps. Pictures in that city were, these violet mountains could not be than 300 miles. their, fairy - essence rose above that, edge. It was like the edge of a planet about to rise into heavens. Their height,, must have been beyond any known comparison. It carried them up into layers of the atmosphere. Those layers are inhabited by ghosts that flyers have lived to whisper about after crashes. Looking at the,m I thought of carved hints. They hinted at what river had washed down into the city from their slopes. I wondered how sense. How foolishness had been in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them.\n###\nHalf way uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing-spell, and turned to look again at the fantastic palaeogean tangle of incredible stone shapes below us\u2014once more outlined mystically against an unknown west. As we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness; the restless ice-vapours having moved up to the zenith, where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive. There now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city a dim, elfin line of pinnacled violet whose needle-pointed heights loomed dream-like against the beckoning rose-colour of the western sky. Up toward this shimmering rim sloped the ancient table-land, the depressed course of the bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow. For a second we gasped in admiration of the scene\u2019s unearthly cosmic beauty, and then vague horror began to creep into our souls. For this far violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of the forbidden land\u2014highest of earth\u2019s peaks and focus of earth\u2019s evil; harbourers of nameless horrors and Archaean secrets; shunned and prayed to by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living thing of earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending strange beams across the plains in the polar night\u2014beyond doubt the unknown archetype of that dreaded Kadath in the Cold Waste beyond abhorrent Leng, whereof unholy primal legends hint evasively. We were the first human beings ever to see them\u2014and I hope to God we may be the last. If the sculptured maps and pictures in that pre-human city had told truly, these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than 300 miles away; yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin essence jut above that remote and snowy rim, like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens. Their height, then, must have been tremendous beyond all known comparison\u2014carrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata peopled by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper of after unexplainable falls. Looking at them, I thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their accursed slopes\u2014and wondered how much sense and how much folly had lain in the fears of those Old Ones who carved them so reticently."}

Far away that Chaldaea could not remember it. I thought of Sarnath the Doomed, which stood in the land of Mnar when humans were young. I thought of Ib, which was carved from grey stone before humans existed. Suddenly I found a place where the solid [THING] rose bare through the sand. Made a low cliff. Here I saw with happiness what seemed to promise more signs of the ancient [THING]. Cut roughly on the cliff [THING] were the clear fronts of several small, wide [THING] houses. Their insides might keep many secrets of ages too old to count, though sandstorms had long ago erased any carvings that may have been outside. All the dark openings near me were low and filled with sand. I cleared one with my shovel and crawled through it. I carried a torch to show whatever mysteries it might hol.d Inside I saw that the cave was indeed a temple. I saw clear signs of the [THING] who had lived. Worshipped there before the desert was a desert. There were altars, pillars, and spaces in the walls, all strangely low. I saw no statues or [THING] paintings. But there were many unusual stones clearly shaped into symbols by human hands. The carved [THING] was very low, so I could hardly do more than kneel upright. But the space was so large that my torch showed only part at a time. I felt a strange shudder in some of the far corners. Certain altars and stones hinted at forgotten ceremonies of a terrible, disgusting, and unexplainable kind. This made me wonder what sort of men could have built. Used such a temple. After seeing all that the place held, I crawled out again. I was eagre to find what the other temples might offer. Night had now coem near. Yet the real things I had seen made curiosity stronger than fear. I did not run from the long shadows made by the [THING] that had scared me when I first saw the nameless [THING]. In the dim light I cleared another opening. With a new torch I crawled into it. I found more unclear stones. Symbols, though nothing more certain than the other temple had held. [THING] was just as low, but much less wide. It ended in a very narrow hallway filled with vague and mysterious shrines.\n###\nTo myself I pictured all the splendours of an age so distant that Chaldaea could not recall it, and thought of Sarnath the Doomed, that stood in the land of Mnar when mankind was young, and of Ib, that was carven of grey stone before mankind existed. All at once I came upon a place where the bed-rock rose stark through the sand and formed a low cliff; and here I saw with joy what seemed to promise further traces of the antediluvian people. Hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small, squat rock houses or temples; whose interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too remote for calculation, though sandstorms had long since effaced any carvings which may have been outside. Very low and sand-choked were all of the dark apertures near me, but I cleared one with my spade and crawled through it, carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold. When I was inside I saw that the cavern was indeed a temple, and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshipped before the desert was a desert. Primitive altars, pillars, and niches, all curiously low, were not absent; and though I saw no sculptures nor frescoes, there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means. The lowness of the chiselled chamber was very strange, for I could hardly more than kneel upright; but the area was so great that my torch shewed only part at a time. I shuddered oddly in some of the far corners; for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible, revolting, and inexplicable nature, and made me wonder what manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple. When I had seen all that the place contained, I crawled out again, avid to find what the other temples might yield. Night had now approached, yet the tangible things I had seen made curiosity stronger than fear, so that I did not flee from the long moon-cast shadows that had daunted me when first I saw the nameless city. In the twilight I cleared another aperture and with a new torch crawled into it, finding more vague stones and symbols, though nothing more definite than the other temple had contained. The room was just as low, but much less broad, ending in a very narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines."}

It is even worse when the loose skin turns yellow or gray. The eyes sink in, have circles, and shine strangely. The forehead shows veins and wrinkles. The hands shake and jerk. If you add to this a disgusting mesisness, a crazy disorder of clothes, thick dark hair with white roots. An uncontrolled growth of pure white berad on a once smooth [THING], the total effect is very shocking. This was how Crawford Tillinghast looked on the night his partly clear message brought me to his [THING] after my weeks away. This was the ghost - like figure that shook as it let me in. It held a candle. Looked sneakily over its shoulder as if afraid of unseen things in the old, lonely [THING] set back from Benevolent Street. That That Crawford Tillinghast ever studied sicence and philosophy was a mistake. These things should be left to the cold and detached researcher. They offer two equally sad choices to the [THING] of emotion and action. He will feel hopeless if he fails in his search. He will face unspeakable and unimaginable horrors if he succeeds. Tillinghast had once been the victim of failure, alone and sad. Now I knew, with my own sickening fears, that he was the victim of success. I had truly warned him ten weeks bfeore. That was when he burst out with his story of what he felt he was about to find. He had been red - faced and excited then. He talked in a high and unnatural, though always bookish, voice. \" What do we know, \" he had said, \" of the world and the universe around us? Our ways of getting impressions are ridiculously few. Our idaes of surrounding things are extremely narrow. We see things only as we are built to see them. We can get no idea of their true nature. With five weak senses we claim to understand the endlessly complex cosmos. Other beings with a wider, stronger. Different set of senses might not only see the things we see very differently. They might also see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life. These worlds lie very near yet can never be found with the senses we have. I have always believed that such strange, unreachable worlds exist right beside us. And now I believe I have found a way to break down the walls.\n###\nIt is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or greyed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily glowing, the forehead veined and corrugated, and the hands tremulous and twitching. And if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness; a wild disorder of dress, a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots, and an unchecked growth of pure white beard on a face once clean-shaven, the cumulative effect is quite shocking. But such was the aspect of Crawford Tillinghast on the night his half-coherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile; such the spectre that trembled as it admitted me, candle in hand, and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient, lonely house set back from Benevolent Street. That Crawford Tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake. These things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator, for they offer two equally tragic alternatives to the man of feeling and action; despair if he fail in his quest, and terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed. Tillinghast had once been the prey of failure, solitary and melancholy; but now I knew, with nauseating fears of my own, that he was the prey of success. I had indeed warned him ten weeks before, when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover. He had been flushed and excited then, talking in a high and unnatural, though always pedantic, voice. \u201cWhat do we know,\u201d he had said, \u201cof the world and the universe about us? Our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few, and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow. We see things only as we are constructed to see them, and can gain no idea of their absolute nature. With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with a wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have. I have always believed that such strange, inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows, and now I believe I have found a way to break down the barriers."}

He spoke of the strong pull and attraction of his discoveries. I felt a strong desire to explore his deepest secrets. My friend said they were terrible and striking beyond my wildest thoughts. He said what appeared on a [THING] in the dark [THING] predicted things only Nyarlathotep dared to predict. He said in the crackle of his sparks, something was taken from men. That thing had never been taken before. Yet it only showed in the eyes. I heard it suggested in public that those who knew Nyarlathotep saw sights others did not see. It was in the hot autumn. I went through the night with the restless crowds to see Nyarlathotep. I went through the heavy night and up the endless stairs into the tight [THING]. And shown on a [THING], I saw robed shapes among ruins. I saw yellow evil faces looking from behind fallen monuments. And I saw the world fighting against darkness. It fought against waves of ruin from the farthest space. It was spinning and churning. It struggled around the growing dim and cooling [THING]. Tehn the sparks moved in an amazing way around the heads of the watchers. Hair stood straight up. Shadows more strange than I can describe came out. They sat on the heads. When I, who was calmer. More scientific than the others, muttered a shaking objection about \" fake action \". \" static electricity \", Nyarlathotep drove us all out. We went down the dizzy stairs into the damp, hot, empty midnight streets. I shouted loudly that I was not scared. I said I never could be scared. Others shouted with me for comfort. We promised to each other that the [THING] was exactly the same. We said it was still alive. When the electric lights began to grow dim, we cursed the company again and agai.n We laughed at the odd faces we made. I believe we felt something coimng down from the greenish [THING]. When we began to depend on its light, we moved into odd unplanned groups. We seemed to know our goals though we dared not think of them. Once we looked at the [THING] and found the blocks loose and moved by grass. There was hardly a line of rusted [THING] to show where the streetcars had run. And again we saw a streetcar. It was alone, without windows, broken down, and almost on its side. When we looked around the horizon, we could not find the third tower by the [THING]. We noticed that the outline of the second tower was rough at the top.\n###\nMy friend had told me of him, and of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations, and I burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries. My friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings; that what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but Nyarlathotep dared prophesy, and that in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes. And I heard it hinted abroad that those who knew Nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw not. It was in the hot autumn that I went through the night with the restless crowds to see Nyarlathotep; through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into the choking room. And shadowed on a screen, I saw hooded forms amidst ruins, and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments. And I saw the world battling against blackness; against the waves of destruction from ultimate space; whirling, churning; struggling around the dimming, cooling sun. Then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators, and hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque than I can tell came out and squatted on the heads. And when I, who was colder and more scientific than the rest, mumbled a trembling protest about \u201cimposture\u201d and \u201cstatic electricity\u201d, Nyarlathotep drave us all out, down the dizzy stairs into the damp, hot, deserted midnight streets. I screamed aloud that I was not afraid; that I never could be afraid; and others screamed with me for solace. We sware to one another that the city was exactly the same, and still alive; and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed the company over and over again, and laughed at the queer faces we made. I believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon, for when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of them. Once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced by grass, with scarce a line of rusted metal to shew where the tramways had run. And again we saw a tram-car, lone, windowless, dilapidated, and almost on its side. When we gazed around the horizon, we could not find the third tower by the river, and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top."}

Perhaps I should put aside my disgust and tell the story at last. I state with certainty, based on first-hand checks. Strict math by both my accountant. Me, that the then lost receipts were not at all the cause of the maze-like problems we faced. I have said the papers were terribly messy. Now I must add that some were marked. Had parts taken away in the oddest, most orderly. Most inhuman way. Thsi was true for both money coming in and money taken out. All the bigger, more profitable items, whether from pay. Investments, had their most solid number groups examined. Removed, like by a careful doctor. Around them was a strange large number of codes. These were taken from the secret instruction booklets of the office. They brought up the most awful connections. The job had happened in one of rough home offices from which the forms had been pulled. Later changes had erased all notes which could have given any reasonable clarity. Scattered pieces of paper, roughly torn from the official instruction packs, offered no comfort. It is no use to mention the half-seen certain faint pencil marks in one protected corner of the ruined ledger. That impression was not about readable numbers at all. It was clearly mixed with all the talk of money ghosts which poor Jenkins had been saying all the months before. One had to guard one's sanity in the shadow of those coming deadlines of hopelessness.\n###\nBut whatever had transpired, it was tedious and vexatious enough. Perhaps I had better set aside my repugnance and recount the ordeal at last\u2014though with a categorical statement of conviction, based on the first-hand examinations and most rigid calculations of both my accountant and myself, that the then misplaced receipts were in no way accountable for the labyrinthine complexities we encountered. I have said that the documents were frightfully disorganized. Now I must add that some were annotated and subtracted from in the most curious, methodical, and inhuman fashion. It was the same with both incomes and deductions. All the more substantial, more profitable entries, whether from wages or investments, had had their most solid masses of figures scrutinized and extracted, as by a meticulous surgeon; and around them was a strange profusion of codes\u2014taken from the arcane instruction booklets of the bureau\u2014which conjured up the most dreadful associations. The task had occurred in one of the crude home offices from which the forms had been dragged out, and subsequent revisions had effaced all notations which could have supplied any plausible clarity. Scattered bits of stationery, roughly torn from the official instruction packets, hinted no solace. It is useless to bring up the half-impression of certain faint pencil marks in one shielded corner of the ruined ledger\u2014because that impression did not concern legible digits at all, but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fiscal phantoms which poor Jenkins had been uttering throughout the preceding months. One had to be careful of one\u2019s sanity in the shadow of those looming deadlines of despair."}

There lay great Cthulhu and his hordes, hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last, after cycles incalculable, the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration.

Curved, the way they were grouped together. The fact that they had no windows at all, was very upsetting to prisoner. He deeply regretted the foolishness which had made him drink the strange wine of that merchant with the rounded hat. As the coast got nearer. The horrible smell of that city grew stronger, he saw upon the sharp hills many forests, some of whose trees he knew as related to that single moon-tree in the magic wood of earth, from whose liquid the small brown zoogs make their special wine. Carter could now see moving shapes on the foul docks ahead. The better he saw them the mroe he began to fear. For they were not men at all. Even close to men. Large greyish-white slippery things which could grow. Shrink as they wished. Whose main shapewas that of a kind of toad without any eyes. With a strangely shaking bunch of short pink arms on the end of its blunt, unclear nose. These objects were walking busily about the docks, moving bundles. Cases with unnatural strength. Then jumping on. Off some anchored ship with long oars in their front feet. Then one would appear leading a group of walking slaves, which indeed were close to human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in Dylath-Leen. Only these groups, being without hats. Clothes, did not seem. Very human after all. Some of these slaveswere taken off ships. Put in boxes which workers puhsed into low storage buildings. Loaded on large slow carts. Once a cart was attached. The amazing thing which pulled it was such that Carter caguht his breath, even after having seen the other monsters of that hateful place. Then a small group of slaves dressed. Hatted like the dark merchants would be led onto a ship, followed by a large group of the slippery grey toad-things as officers, pilots. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were kept for the more shameful kinds of work which required no strength, such as steering. Dealing with men on the earth. Other planets where they traded.\n###\nThere presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast, and Carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they leaned and bent, the manner in which they were clustered, and the fact that they had no windows at all, was very disturbing to the prisoner; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban. As the coast drew nearer, and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger, he saw upon the jagged hills many forests, some of whose trees he recognised as akin to that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth, from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment their peculiar wine. Carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead, and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them. For they were not men at all, or even approximately men, but great greyish-white slippery things which could expand and contract at will, and whose principal shape\u2014though it often changed\u2014was that of a sort of toad without any eyes, but with a curiously vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt, vague snout. These objects were waddling busily about the wharves, moving bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength, and now and then hopping on or off some anchored galley with long oars in their fore paws. And now and then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves, which indeed were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in Dylath-Leen; only these herds, being without turbans or shoes or clothing, did not seem so very human after all. Some of these slaves\u2014the fatter ones, whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentally\u2014were unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vans. Once a van was hitched up and driven off, and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that Carter gasped, even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place. Now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley, followed by a great crew of the slippery grey toad-things as officers, navigators, and rowers. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength, such as steering and cooking, fetching and carrying, and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded."}

Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Orne\u2019s and Hutchinson\u2019s; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise. At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Ward\u2019s immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charles\u2019s normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard\u2019s writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection."}

Not 'the concept' but the thing itself.\n\nSome houses along Main Street had [THING] living in them. Most were closed up tightly with boards. On Down unpaved side streets, I saw the dark, empty windows of abandoned small houses. Many of these houses leaned at dangerous. Unbelievable angles because part of their foundations had sunk. Those windows looked so ghostly taht I needed courage to turn east toward the waterfront. In Certainly, the fear caused by a deserted [THING] grows much faster when many houses together form a [THING] of complete emptiness. Seeing such long streets of vacant, dead - looking buildings. Thinking about endless connected dark rooms full of spiderwebs, memories. Decay, stirs up deep, old fears. Even the strongest philosophy can not make these feelings go away. Fish Street was as empty as Main. It was different because it had many brick. [THING] warehouses still in very good condition. Water Street was almost the same, except there were large open spaces facing the [THING] where wharves used to be. I did not see any living thing, except for some scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater. I did not hear any sound, except for the gentle movement of the harbor tides. The loud noise of the falls in the Manuxet. The [THING] was making me more and more nervous. I looked behind me secretly as I carefully walked back over the shaky Water Street bridge. The The Fish Street bridge, based on the sketch, was in broken condition. On the north side of the [THING], there were signs of poor life \u2014 active fish - packing houses in Water Street, smoking chimneys. Repaired roofs here. There, occasional sounds from unclear sources. Rare, slow - moving shapes in the sad streets. However, I found this even more upsetting than the empty area to the south. One reason was that the [THING] were more ugly. Unusual than those near the center of [THING]. This made me think, in a bad way, of something completely strange that I could not quite remember. Perhaps the foreign ancestry in the Innsmouth [THING] was stronger here than farther inland. Unless, of course, the \" Innsmouth look \" was a sickness rather than a bloodline. In that case, this area might contain the more serious cases. One detail that btohered me was how the few quiet sounds I heard were spread out. They should have come only from the houses that clearly had [THING] living in them. In reality, the sounds were often loudest inside the houses with the most tightly boarded - up fronts.\n###\nSome houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse. Fish Street was as deserted as Main, though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape. Water Street was almost its duplicate, save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been. Not a living thing did I see, except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater, and not a sound did I hear save the lapping of the harbour tides and the roar of the falls in the Manuxet. The town was getting more and more on my nerves, and I looked behind me furtively as I picked my way back over the tottering Water Street bridge. The Fish Street bridge, according to the sketch, was in ruins. North of the river there were traces of squalid life\u2014active fish-packing houses in Water Street, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes\u2014but I seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion. For one thing, the people were more hideous and abnormal than those near the centre of the town; so that I was several times evilly reminded of something utterly fantastic which I could not quite place. Undoubtedly the alien strain in the Innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inland\u2014unless, indeed, the \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d were a disease rather than a blood strain, in which case this district might be held to harbour the more advanced cases. One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds I heard. They ought naturally to have come wholly from the visibly inhabited houses, yet in reality were often strongest inside the most rigidly boarded-up facades."}

Some [THING] said he was unfeeling in his grief. This was especially true because his cheerful. Self - assured moods in the [THING] became more common. He now wanted to move back into the old Derby mansion. However, Asenath insisted on staying in the Crowninshield [THING]. She had become very comfortable there. Not long after, my wife heard a strange story from a friend. This friend was one of the few who still kept in touch with the Derbys. The friend had gone to the end of High St to visti the couple. She saw a [THING] quickly leave the driveway. Edward 's strangely confident and almost mocking [THING] was visible above the steering [THING]. She rang Ringing the bell. The unpleasant maid told her that Asenath was also out. But as she was leaving, she happened to look up at the [THING]. There, at one of Edward 's library windows, she saw a [THING] that was quickly pulled back. The expression on that [THING] showed pain, defeat, and a longing hopelessness. It was deeply moving beyond words. Incredibly, considering its usual commanding look, it was Asenath 's [THING]. The visitor swore that in that moment, the sad, confused eyes of poor Edward were looking out from it. Edward 's visits to me now became a little more frequent. His hints sometimes became clear statements. What he said was unbelievable, even in ancient, legend - filled Arkham. He shared his dark knowledge with such sincerity. Persuasiveness that it made one worry for his mind. He talked about terrible meetings in lonely places. He spoke of Cyclopean ruins in the middle of the Maine woods. Under these ruins, huge staircases lead down to deep pits of dark secrets. He mentioned complex angles that go through invisible walls to other areas of space. He described horrible exchanges of personality. These exchanges allowed explorations in distant. Forbidden places, on other worlds. In different space - time continuums. Now and then, he would support his crazy hints by showing objects. These objects completely confused me. They had elusive colors and puzzling textures unlike anythnig known on Earth. Their insane curvse and surfaces served no understandable purpose and followed no known geometry. He said these things came ' from outside '. His wife knew how to obtain them. Sometimes, he would suggest things about old Ephraim Waite. He had seen Ephraim Watie occasionally at the college library in the past. He always said these things in frightened and unclear whispers. These hints were never detailed. They seemed to center on a particularly awful doubt. The doutb was whether the old wizard was truly dead \u2014 in a spiritual sense as well as a physical one.\n###\nSome called him callous in his loss\u2014especially since those jaunty and confident moods in the car began to increase. He now wished to move back into the old Derby mansion, but Asenath insisted on staying in the Crowninshield house, to which she had become well adjusted. Not long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend\u2014one of the few who had not dropped the Derbys. She had been out to the end of High St. to call on the couple, and had seen a car shoot briskly out of the drive with Edward\u2019s oddly confident and almost sneering face above the wheel. Ringing the bell, she had been told by the repulsive wench that Asenath was also out; but had chanced to look up at the house in leaving. There, at one of Edward\u2019s library windows, she had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn face\u2014a face whose expression of pain, defeat, and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description. It was\u2014incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast\u2014Asenath\u2019s; yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad, muddled eyes of poor Edward were gazing out from it. Edward\u2019s calls now grew a trifle more frequent, and his hints occasionally became concrete. What he said was not to be believed, even in centuried and legend-haunted Arkham; but he threw out his dark lore with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear for his sanity. He talked about terrible meetings in lonely places, of Cyclopean ruins in the heart of the Maine woods beneath which vast staircases lead down to abysses of nighted secrets, of complex angles that lead through invisible walls to other regions of space and time, and of hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and forbidden places, on other worlds, and in different space-time continua. He would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects which utterly nonplussed me\u2014elusively coloured and bafflingly textured objects like nothing ever heard of on earth, whose insane curves and surfaces answered no conceivable purpose and followed no conceivable geometry. These things, he said, came \u2018from outside\u2019; and his wife knew how to get them. Sometimes\u2014but always in frightened and ambiguous whispers\u2014he would suggest things about old Ephraim Waite, whom he had seen occasionally at the college library in the old days. These adumbrations were never specific, but seemed to revolve around some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really dead\u2014in a spiritual as well as corporeal sense."}

On On August 16 I left the U-29. With effort I made my way through the ruined. Mud - filled streets to the river. I found no skeletons or remains. But I collected a wealth of knowledge from sculptures and coins. I can not speak of this, except to say my awe at a culture in its glory. This was when cave people wandered Europe. The Nile river flowed to the sea. Others, guided by this writing if it is found, msut reveal the mysteries I can hint at. I returned to the boat as my batteries grew. I decided to explore the rock temple the day. On the 17th, as my urge to search out the temple 's mystery grew, a disappointment hit me. I found the materials needed to refill the light had been ruined in the mutiny of those pigs in July. My anger was. Yet my sense stopped me from going into a interior. It might be the home of some sea monster. Or it might be a maze of passages from which I could escape.\n###\nPerhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the nucleus. Neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this awful fane\u2014for fane indeed it must be\u2014and today after thousands of years it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of an ocean chasm. I cannot reckon the number of hours I spent in gazing at the sunken city with its buildings, arches, statues, and bridges, and the colossal temple with its beauty and mystery. Though I knew that death was near, my curiosity was consuming; and I threw the searchlight\u2019s beam about in eager quest. The shaft of light permitted me to learn many details, but refused to shew anything within the gaping door of the rock-hewn temple; and after a time I turned off the current, conscious of the need of conserving power. The rays were now perceptibly dimmer than they had been during the weeks of drifting. And as if sharpened by the coming deprivation of light, my desire to explore the watery secrets grew. I, a German, should be the first to tread those aeon-forgotten ways! I produced and examined a deep-sea diving suit of joined metal, and experimented with the portable light and air regenerator. Though I should have trouble in managing the double hatches alone, I believed I could overcome all obstacles with my scientific skill and actually walk about the dead city in person. On August 16 I effected an exit from the U-29, and laboriously made my way through the ruined and mud-choked streets to the ancient river. I found no skeletons or other human remains, but gleaned a wealth of archaeological lore from sculptures and coins. Of this I cannot now speak save to utter my awe at a culture in the full noon of glory when cave-dwellers roamed Europe and the Nile flowed unwatched to the sea. Others, guided by this manuscript if it shall ever be found, must unfold the mysteries at which I can only hint. I returned to the boat as my electric batteries grew feeble, resolved to explore the rock temple on the following day. On the 17th, as my impulse to search out the mystery of the temple waxed still more insistent, a great disappointment befell me; for I found that the materials needed to replenish the portable light had perished in the mutiny of those pigs in July. My rage was unbounded, yet my German sense forbade me to venture unprepared into an utterly black interior which might prove the lair of some indescribable marine monster or a labyrinth of passages from whose windings I could never extricate myself."}

And once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears, plainer than before, but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak. These beats were ruthless and purposeful, and they were behind him. Carter\u2019s pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing, for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable. His yak must have heard or felt it first, and he did not like to ask himself whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit. Meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind, so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost. He could not see the hoofprints of his yak, but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping; mingled now and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings. That he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him, and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands. Only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense of direction, and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place. Then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible thing. He had thought it for some moments a range of black mountains, but now he saw it was something more. The phosphorescence of the brooding clouds shewed it plainly, and even silhouetted parts of it as low vapours glowed behind. How distant it was he could not tell, but it must have been very far. It was thousands of feet high, stretching in a great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces, and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills. But now those hills were hills no more, for some hand greater than man\u2019s had touched them. Silent they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls, crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever."}
