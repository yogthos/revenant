These fears are very vague, wild, and silly. They are about a silly legend of the bog. The legend is about a sacry guardian spirit. This spirit is said to live in the strange old ruin on the far island seen at sunset. Tehre are tales of dancing lights when the moon is dark. There are tales of cold winds on warm nights. There are tales of white ghosts over the water. There are tales of an imagined stone city deep under the swamp. The main strange idea. The only one everoyne agrees on, is about a curse. The curse awaits anyone who dares to touch or drain the big reddish swamp. The peasants say there are secrets that must not be found. These secrets have been hidden since a plague came to the children of Partholan in the legendary years before history. The Book of Invaders says these sons of the Greeks were all buried at Tallaght. But old men in Kilderry said one city was missed, except by its protecting moon-goddess. Only the wooded hills buried it when the men of Nemed came down from Scythia in their thirty ships.\n###\nWhen I heard the fears which had driven the people from Kilderry I laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed, for these fears were of the vaguest, wildest, and most absurd character. They had to do with some preposterous legend of the bog, and of a grim guardian spirit that dwelt in the strange olden ruin on the far islet I had seen in the sunset. There were tales of dancing lights in the dark of the moon, and of chill winds when the night was warm; of wraiths in white hovering over the waters, and of an imagined city of stone deep down below the swampy surface. But foremost among the weird fancies, and alone in its absolute unanimity, was that of the curse awaiting him who should dare to touch or drain the vast reddish morass. There were secrets, said the peasants, which must not be uncovered; secrets that had lain hidden since the plague came to the children of Partholan in the fabulous years beyond history. In the Book of Invaders it is told that these sons of the Greeks were all buried at Tallaght, but old men in Kilderry said that one city was overlooked save by its patron moon-goddess; so that only the wooded hills buried it when the men of Nemed swept down from Scythia in their thirty ships."}

At first, one thinks it is because they are all quiet and keep to themselves. Later, one decides it is because they are all very odl. It is not known how one comes to live on such a street. One is not in one's right mind when moving there. One had lived in many poor places before. One was always forced to leave for lack of money. Finally, one came upon that shaky house in Rue d'Auseil. A paralyzed man named Blandot kept it. It was the third house from the top of the street. It was much taller than all the other houses.\n###\nThe inhabitants of that street impressed me peculiarly.

Our binoculars showed that horizontal bands of almost gone carvings. Dot patterns were very common. We could partly imagine what the city must have looked like before. This was even though most roofs and tower tops had to be gone. Overall, it had been a complex mix of twisted small streets and alleys. All of them were deep canyons. Smoe were almost like tunnels because of hanging stonework or bridges above. Now, it lay below us like a dream against a mist to the west. The low, red Antarctic sun of early afteronon tried to shine through the north end of this mist. When the sun hit a thikcer cloud. Put the scene in shadow for a moment, the effect was strangely threatening. We can never hpoe to describe this feeling.

Now, outspread below us, it loomed like a dream-phantasy against a westward mist through whose northern end the low, reddish antarctic sun of early afternoon was struggling to shine; and when for a moment that sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow, the effect was subtly menacing in a way I can never hope to depict. Even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful malignity. The last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and abrupt, and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led us to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there. Under the glaciation, we believed, there must be a flight of steps or its equivalent."}

His story was correct. Certainly, these pictures showed clear proof of something in the Vermont hills. This thing was far outside our common knowledge and belief. The worst thing was the footprint. It was a picture taken where the sun shone on a mud patch in a deserted upland. This was not a fake. We could see that at once. The pebbles and grass blades in the picture were sharp. Tehy showed the scale clearly. There was no chance of a double exposure. We called it a \"footprint,\" but \"claw-print\" is better. Even now we can hardly describe it. We can only say it looked like a crab and its direction was unclear. The print was not or fresh. It was about the size of a man's foot. From a central pad, pairs of saw-toothed nippers stuck out in opposite directions. Their purpose was confusing, if the whole thing was only for moving.\n###\nThe more I looked at them, the more I saw that my serious estimate of Akeley and his story had not been unjustified. Certainly, these pictures carried conclusive evidence of something in the Vermont hills which was at least vastly outside the radius of our common knowledge and belief. The worst thing of all was the footprint\u2014a view taken where the sun shone on a mud patch somewhere in a deserted upland. This was no cheaply counterfeited thing, I could see at a glance; for the sharply defined pebbles and grass-blades in the field of vision gave a clear index of scale and left no possibility of a tricky double exposure. I have called the thing a \u201cfootprint\u201d, but \u201cclaw-print\u201d would be a better term.

Finally, far below, faint gray lines and scary tall peaks are seen. It is known these must be the famous Peaks of Thok.

But it becomes clear that these are better to look at than the captors. The captors are shocking and rough black beings. They have smooth, oily, whale-like skin. They have unpleasant horns that curve toward each other. They have bat-wings that make no sound when beating. They have ugly gripping paws. Tails with barbs thta move for no reason, causing worry. Worst of all, it is seen that they never speak or laugh. They never smiel because they have no faces to smile with. Instead, they have only an empty space where a face should be.

But Carter preferred to look at them than at his captors, which were indeed shocking and uncouth black beings with smooth, oily, whale-like surfaces, unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other, bat-wings whose beating made no sound, ugly prehensile paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly.

The dogs drooled and crouched close to the feet of the fera-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit. But he knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the women whimpered. They kept from screaming by some vague, leftover instinct of defence. This told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle went down to a pitiful moaning. A great snapping, crashing, and crackling followed. The Fryes, huddled tgoether in the sitting-room, did not dare to moev until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the sad moans from the stable. The devilish piping of late whippoorwills in the valley, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone. She spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror. The next day all the countryside was in a panic. Scared, quiet groups came and went where the evil thing had happened. Two giant paths of destruction stretched from the valley to.\n###\nThe dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror. The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather. Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority."}

These were all linked to forces in this piece of land. They deserved the protection. I intend to show you some results of these arts and discoveries. I will do this in the secrecy. I trust my judgment of people. I have no doubt about your interest or your loyalty. \" He stopped. I could nod. I said I was. to my soul, the daylight world of New York felt. Whether this man was a person. A user of arts, I had no choice. I had to follow him. I had to satisfy my curiosity with whatever he might show. I lsitened. \" To my ancsetor, \" he continued, \" human will seemed to have qualities. These qualities had an power. This power was not over one 's actions and the actions of others. It was over every kind of force and substanec in Nature. It was over elements and dimensions considered than Nature itself. Should I say he mocked the sacredness of things as space and time? Sohuld I say he used the rituals of - blood Indians in ways? Those people camped on this hill. These Indians showed anger when the place was built. They were in asking to visit the grounds at the moon. For years, they stole over the wall each month when they could. They performed acts., in 1768, the squire caught them in the act. He stood at what he saw. After that, he made a deal with them. He gave them access to his grounds. In exchange, he learned the details of what they did. He learned that their grandfathers got part of their practice from ancestors. They got another part from an Dutchman from the time of the States - General. And curse him, I fear the squire must have given them rum. It might have been on purpose or not. A week after he learned the secret, he was the living man who knew it.\n###\nThere were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family, and I have not been remiss in discharging such obligations. The squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding. Some curious effects of these arts and discoveries I now purpose to shew you, under the strictest secrecy; and I believe I may rely on my judgment of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelity.\u201d He paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was alarmed, yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of New York, and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts I had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to offer. So I listened. \u201cTo\u2014my ancestor\u2014\u201d he softly continued, \u201cthere appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a little-suspected dominance not only over the acts of one\u2019s self and of others, but over every variety of force and substance in Nature, and over many elements and dimensions deemed more univarsal than Nature herself. May I say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time, and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half-breed red Indians once encamped upon this hill? These Indians shewed choler when the place was built, and were plaguy pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon. For years they stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth performed sartain acts. Then, in \u201968, the new squire catched them at their doings, and stood still at what he saw. Thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did; larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old Dutchman in the time of the States-General. And pox on him, I\u2019m afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum\u2014whether or not by intent\u2014for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it."}

When he returned, he found West in a state of unusual excitement. West told the observer excitedly that he had likely solved the freshness problem. He used a completely new method: artificial preservation. The observer knew that Wset was working on a new and extremely unusual embalming fluid. He was not surprised it worked well. Until Wets explained the details, observer was confused about how this fluid could help their work. The bad condition of the bodies was mostly due to delays before they got them. The observer now saw that West had clearly understood this. He made his embalming fluid for future use, not immediate use. He trusted fate to supply another very recent and unburied corpse. This had happened years before when they got the negro killed in the Bolton prize-fight. Finally, fate was kind. On this occasion, there was a corpse in the secret cellar lab. Its decay could not possibly have started. What would happen when they brought it back? Could they hope for a return of mind and reason? West did not dare to guess. The experiment would be a major point in their studies. West had saved the new body for the observer's return. This way, both of them could watch the event together as usual.\n###\nIt was in July, 1910, that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn.

I had known that he was working on a new and highly unusual embalming compound, and was not surprised that it had turned out well; but until he explained the details I was rather puzzled as to how such a compound could help in our work, since the objectionable staleness of the specimens was largely due to delay occurring before we secured them. This, I now saw, West had clearly recognised; creating his embalming compound for future rather than immediate use, and trusting to fate to supply again some very recent and unburied corpse, as it had years before when we obtained the negro killed in the Bolton prize-fight. At last fate had been kind, so that on this occasion there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by any possibility have begun.

These were fates that should not be present isnide the lands of the Roman People. Allowing wild parties of the sort known to happen at Sabbaths would hardly match the traditions of those whsoe ancestors, when A. Postumius was consul, had put to death so many Roman citizens for practicing the Bacchanalia. This event is always remembered by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, carved on bronze. Displayed for all to see. Checked in time, before the advancement of the rituals might call forth something that the iron of a Roman spear might not handle, the Sabbath would not be beyond the abilities of one cohort. Only those taking patr needed to be arrested. Sparing many mere onlookers would greatly reduce the anger any supportive local people might feel. In brief, both morality and practical strategy required firm action. I did not doubt that Publius Scribonius, remembering the respect. Duties of the Roman People, would stick to his plan of sending the cohort, with me along, despite any objections that Balbutius. Asellius might choose to raise. They spoke more like provincial people than Romans. The low sun was now very near setting. The wohle quiet town seemed covered in strange and evil spell. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul showed he agreed with my words. He placed me with the cohort in the temporary role of a leading centurion. Balbutius and Asellius agreed, the former more willingly than the latter. As evening came on the wild autumn hillsides, a regular, awful beating of odd drums came from far away in a frightening rhythm. A few of the soldiers showed fear, but sharp orders got them into formation. Soon the whole cohort was arranged on the open flatland east of the racetrack. Libo himself, and also Balbutius, insisted on going with the cohort. We had much trouble finding a local guide to show the paths up the mountai.n Finally a young man named Vercellius, the son of purely Roman parents, agreed to lead us at least past the lower hills. We started to march in the growing dark. The thin silver curve of a new moon shook above the woods on our left.\n###\nThere were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia\u2014a matter kept ever in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set open to every eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort. Only participants need be apprehended, and the sparing of a great number of mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment which any of the sympathising country folk might feel. In short, both principle and policy demanded stern action; and I could not doubt but that Publius Scribonius, bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the Roman People, would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort, me accompanying, despite such objections as Balbutius and Asellius\u2014speaking indeed more like provincials than Romans\u2014might see fit to offer and multiply. The slanting sun was now very low, and the whole hushed town seemed draped in an unreal and malign glamour. Then P. Scribonius the proconsul signified his approval of my words, and stationed me with the cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus; Balbutius and Asellius assenting, the former with better grace than the latter. As twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes, a measured, hideous beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible rhythm. Some few of the legionarii shewed timidity, but sharp commands brought them into line, and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open plain east of the circus. Libo himself, as well as Balbutius, insisted on accompanying the cohort; but great difficulty was suffered in getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain. Finally a young man named Vercellius, the son of pure Roman parents, agreed to take us at least past the foothills. We began to march in the new dusk, with the thin silver sickle of a young moon trembling over the woods on our left."}

The war started in 1917. Squire Sawyer Whateley, as [THING] of the local draft board, worked hard to find enough young Dunwich men who were even fit to go to a training camp. The government was worried by these signs of widespread decline in the area. They sent officers and doctors to look into it. They did a study that New England newspaper readers might still remember. The news about this investigation led reporters to look into the Whateleys. It caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print sensational Sunday stories. These stories were about young Wilbur 's early development, Old Whateley 's black magic, the shelves of odd books, the sealed second [THING] of the old farmhouse. The strangeness of the whole area with its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a half years old then but looked like a fifteen - year - old boy. His lips and cheeks had a rough, dark fuzz. His voice was starting to change. Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with the reporters and photographers. He ponited out the strange smell that now seemed to seep down from the sealed upstairs rooms. He said it was exatcly like a smell he had found in the [THING] - shed left behind when the [THING] was finally fixed. It was also like the faint smells he sometimes thought he noticed near the [THING] circles on the mountains. Dunwich [THING] read the stories when they came out. They laughed at the clear mistakes. They also wondered why the writers made such a big deal about the fcat that Old Whateley always paid for his cows with very old gold coins. The Whateleys did not hide their dislike for their visitors, though they did not dare to cause more attention by fighting. Refusing to talk. For ten years, the records of the Whateleys blend into the general life of a sickly community. The community was used to their odd ways. Hardened to their May - Eve. Twice a year they would light fires on top of Sentinel Hill. At those times, the [THING] rumblings would happen again with more and more force. Also, in all seasons, there were strange and ominous events at the lonely farmhouse. Over time, visitors claimed to hear sounds in the sealed upper [THING] even when the whole family was downstaisr. They wondered how fast or how slowly a cow or steer was usually killed.\n###\nIt had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally. In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur\u2019s precociousness, Old Whateley\u2019s black magic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his voice had begun to break. Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the tool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers made so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk. For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their May-Eve and All-Hallows orgies. Twice a year they would light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs, and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed."}

Lake put it from three slate pieces brought up from a - hole. These pieces came from a point to the west, near the Queen Alexandra Range. Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their mark and. To my geologist 's eye, it looked like some effects in rock. Slate is a changed form where a layer is pressed. The pressure itself makes twisting effects on any marks that might exist. I saw no reason for surprise ovre the lined hollow. On January 6, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Atwood, all six students, four mechanics. I flew over the pole in two of the planes. A wind forced us down., it did not turn into a storm. This was, as the papers said, one of watching flights. On flights, we tried to see land features in areas explorers had not reached. Our flights were in this way. They gave us some examples of the,. mirages of the areas. Our sea trip had given us some tastes of these. mountains floated in the sky like cities. world would melt into a gold, silver. land of dreams. waiting under the midnight sun 's magic. On days we had trouble flying. This was because the ground. Sky tended to blend into one, space with no line to mark where they met.\n###\nThere was also a queer triangular, striated marking about a foot in greatest diameter which Lake pieced together from three fragments of slate brought up from a deep-blasted aperture. These fragments came from a point to the westward, near the Queen Alexandra Range; and Lake, as a biologist, seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative, though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks. Since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed, and since the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist, I saw no reason for extreme wonder over the striated depression. On January 6, 1931, Lake, Pabodie, Danforth, all six of the students, four mechanics, and I flew directly over the south pole in two of the great planes, being forced down once by a sudden high wind which fortunately did not develop into a typical storm. This was, as the papers have stated, one of several observation flights; during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas unreached by previous explorers. Our early flights were disappointing in this latter respect; though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions, of which our sea voyage had given us some brief foretastes. Distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities, and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver, and scarlet land of Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun. On cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying, owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two. At length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying 500 miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh sub-base at a point which would probably be on the smaller continental division, as we mistakenly conceived it. Geological specimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison. Our health so far had remained excellent; lime-juice well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs. It was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night."}

Nothing I could dream or feel held any real meaning. Guided by this belief, I achieved much better mental balance. This happened even as the visions, not the vague feelings, grew more common. More upsettingly clear. In 1922, I felt ready to resume normal work. I applied my new undertsanding by taking a job as a psychology instructor at the university. My former position in political economy was already well occupied. Also, how economics was taught had changed a lot since my prime. My son was then starting his advanced studies, which led to his current rloe as a professor. We collaborated often. Still, I kept a detailed log of the bizarre dreams that came to me. I believed such a record had real wroth as a psyhcological study. The glimpses still felt terribly like memories, but I resisted this idea with considerable success. When writing, I described the visions as things I saw. At all other times, I dismissed them like any fleeting night illusion. I never spoke of these things in ordinary talk. However, stories about them leaked out, as such things do. This sparked various rumors about my mental state. It is funny to think these rumors came only from non-experts. Not a single doctor or psychologist supported them. Of my visions after 1914, I will describe only a few here. More complete reports are available for the serious researcher. Clearly, over time, the straneg mental blocks lessened somewhat. The range of my visions grew much larger. Yet, they never became more than disconnected pieces that seemed to have no clear reason. In the dreams, I seemed to gain more and more freedom to roam. I drifted through many odd stone buildings. I went from one to another using huge underground passages. These seemed to be the main travel routes. I came upon those giant sealed trapdoors on the lowest level. A strong feeling of fear and prohibition surrounded them. I saw vast patterned pools and rooms full of strange, unexplained tools of many kinds. Thne there were enormous caves with complex machines. Their shapes and uses were completely unknown to me. Their sound only became apparent after many years of dreaming.\n###\nNothing that I might dream, nothing that I might feel, could be of any actual significance. Fortified by this philosophy, I greatly improved in nervous equilibrium, even though the visions (rather than the abstract impressions) steadily became more frequent and more disturbingly detailed. In 1922 I felt able to undertake regular work again, and put my newly gained knowledge to practical use by accepting an instructorship in psychology at the university. My old chair of political economy had long been adequately filled\u2014besides which, methods of teaching economics had changed greatly since my heyday. My son was at this time just entering on the post-graduate studies leading to his present professorship, and we worked together a great deal. I continued, however, to keep a careful record of the outr\u00e9 dreams which crowded upon me so thickly and vividly. Such a record, I argued, was of genuine value as a psychological document. The glimpses still seemed damnably like memories, though I fought off this impression with a goodly measure of success. In writing, I treated the phantasmata as things seen; but at all other times I brushed them aside like any gossamer illusions of the night. I had never mentioned such matters in common conversation; though reports of them, filtering out as such things will, had aroused sundry rumours regarding my mental health. It is amusing to reflect that these rumours were confined wholly to laymen, without a single champion among physicians or psychologists. Of my visions after 1914 I will here mention only a few, since fuller accounts and records are at the disposal of the serious student. It is evident that with time the curious inhibitions somewhat waned, for the scope of my visions vastly increased. They have never, though, become other than disjointed fragments seemingly without clear motivation. Within the dreams I seemed gradually to acquire a greater and greater freedom of wandering. I floated through many strange buildings of stone, going from one to the other along mammoth underground passages which seemed to form the common avenues of transit. Sometimes I encountered those gigantic sealed trap-doors in the lowest level, around which such an aura of fear and forbiddenness clung. I saw tremendous tessellated pools, and rooms of curious and inexplicable utensils of myriad sorts. Then there were colossal caverns of intricate machinery whose outlines and purpose were wholly strange to me, and whose sound manifested itself only after many years of dreaming."}

Then a small group of slaves dresse.d Hatted like the dark merchants would be led onto a ship, followed by a large group of the slippery grey toad-things as officers, pilots. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were kept for the more shameful kinds of work which required no strength, such as steering. Dealing with men on the earth. Other planets where they traded. These creatures must have been useful on earth, for they were truly not unlike men when dressed. Could argue in the shops of men without shame. Most of them, unless thin. Ugly, were without clothes. Packed in boxes. Taken away in slow carts by amazing things. Occasionally other beings were taken off and boxed. Some very like these half-humans, some not so similar, and some not similar at all. He wondered if any of the poor large black men of Parg were left to be taken off. Sent inland in those hateful carts. When the ship landed at a greasy-looking dock of soft rock a nightmare crowd of toad-things moved out of the openings. Two of them grabbed Carter. Pulled him onto land. Look of that city cannot be told. Carter kept only separate pictures of the tiled streets. Endless cliffs of grey straight walls without windows. At last he was pulled inside a low doorway. Made to climb endless steps in complete darkness. It was, clearly, all the same to the toad-things whether it was light or dark. The smell of the place was too much. When Carter was locked into a room. Left alone he almost had no strength to move around. Find out its shape. It was round, and about twenty feet across. From then on time stopped existing. At times food was pushed in, but Carter would not touch it. What his end would be, he did not know. He felt that he was kept for the coming of that terrible soul. Messenger of endless Other Gods, the moving disorder Nyarlathotep. Finally, atfer an unknown length of hours. Days, the great stone door opened wide again. Carter was pushed down stairs. Out into red-lit streets of that fearful city.\n###\nNow and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley, followed by a great crew of the slippery grey toad-things as officers, navigators, and rowers. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength, such as steering and cooking, fetching and carrying, and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded. These creatures must have been convenient on earth, for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned, and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations. But most of them, unless lean and ill-favoured, were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things. Occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated; some very like these semi-humans, some not so similar, and some not similar at all. And he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of Parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those obnoxious drays. When the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of toad-things wiggled out of the hatches, and two of them seized Carter and dragged him ashore. The smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling, and Carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows. At length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness. It was, apparently, all one to the toad-things whether it were light or dark. The odour of the place was intolerable, and when Carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions. It was circular, and about twenty feet across. From then on time ceased to exist. At intervals food was pushed in, but Carter would not touch it. What his fate would be, he did not know; but he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinity\u2019s Other Gods, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Finally, after an unguessed span of hours or days, the great stone door swung wide again and Carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the red-litten streets of that fearsome city."}

There was plenty of gossip about his and oddness. What made the students shake their heads was his theory. The theory was that a man might step from the earth to any bdoy. This would require knowledge beyond all likelihood of gaining. That body would lie at one of an number of points in the pattern. Such a step, he said, would require two stages., a passage out of the three - sphere we know., a passage to the there - sphere at another point. That point might be one of distance. It was this could be done without loss of life in cases. Any being from any part of three - space could survive in the dimension. Its survival of the stage would depend on what part of three - space it chose for its re - entry. The inhabitants of some planets might be to live on planets. These could be planets belonging to galaxies. Or they could belong to - phases of space - time continua., there must be numbers of bodies or zones of space. This would be if they were to each. It was that the inhabitants of a given realm could survive entry to. These realms would have or dimensions. They could be within or outside the given space - time continuum. The converse would be. This was a matter for speculation. But one could be of one thing. The type of change involvde in a passage from any given plane to the plane would not destroy integrity as we understand it. Gilman could not be about his reasons for this assumption. But his haziness was than by his clarity on points. Professor Upham liked his demonstration. It showed the relaitonship of mathematics to phases of lore. This lore had been passed down the ages from an antiquity. That antiquity was or. Its knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was than ours. Around the of April Gilman he worried a lot. This was because his fever did not go down. He was troubled by what some of his fellow - lodgers said about his sleep - walking. It seemed he was from his bed. The man in the room remarked on the creaking of his floor at hours of the night.\n###\nGilman\u2019s handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration, even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary eccentricity. What made the students shake their heads was his sober theory that a man might\u2014given mathematical knowledge admittedly beyond all likelihood of human acquirement\u2014step deliberately from the earth to any other celestial body which might lie at one of an infinity of specific points in the cosmic pattern. Such a step, he said, would require only two stages; first, a passage out of the three-dimensional sphere we know, and second, a passage back to the three-dimensional sphere at another point, perhaps one of infinite remoteness. That this could be accomplished without loss of life was in many cases conceivable. Any being from any part of three-dimensional space could probably survive in the fourth dimension; and its survival of the second stage would depend upon what alien part of three-dimensional space it might select for its re-entry. Denizens of some planets might be able to live on certain others\u2014even planets belonging to other galaxies, or to similar-dimensional phases of other space-time continua\u2014though of course there must be vast numbers of mutually uninhabitable even though mathematically juxtaposed bodies or zones of space. It was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm could survive entry to many unknown and incomprehensible realms of additional or indefinitely multiplied dimensions\u2014be they within or outside the given space-time continuum\u2014and that the converse would be likewise true. This was a matter for speculation, though one could be fairly certain that the type of mutation involved in a passage from any given dimensional plane to the next higher plane would not be destructive of biological integrity as we understand it. Gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption, but his haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points. Professor Upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquity\u2014human or pre-human\u2014whose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours. Around the first of April Gilman worried considerably because his slow fever did not abate. He was also troubled by what some of his fellow-lodgers said about his sleep-walking. It seemed that he was often absent from his bed, and that the creaking of his floor at certain hours of the night was remarked by the man in the room below."}

There was too much silence in the dim alleys between them, and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and mattings of infinite years of decay. In the open spaces, mostly along the line of the old road, there were little hillside farms; sometimes with all the buildings standing, sometimes with only one or two, and sometimes with only a lone chimney or fast-filling cellar.

His father decided to buy the picture right away, even though it was painted on fixed wood panels. The picture looked extremely much like the boy, even though it seemed older. It was clear that through some trick of family inheritance, the physical shape of Joseph Curwen had been exactly copied after 150 years. Mrs. Ward did not look much like her ancestor. She remembered relatives who had some facial features that her son. The long-gone Curwen shared. She did not like this discovery. She told her husband he should burn the picture, not bring it home. She said there was something about it. This was not only because of the picture itself. Also because it looked. Much like Charles. However, Mr. Ward was a practical and powerful mna. He was a cotton maker with mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley. He did not listen to a woman's worries. The picture strongly impressed him because it looked like his son. He believed his son should have it as a gift. Of course, we agreed with this idea very much. A few days later, Mr. Ward found the house's owner. The owner was a person with rodent-like features and a throaty accent. Mr. Ward bought the whloe mantle and the overmantel with the picture. He paid a set price that was quickly fixed. This stopped the expected flood of oily bargaining.\n###\nWard brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Ward\u2019s resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs\u2014a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley\u2014and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house\u2014a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent\u2014and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling."}

In the following June, we firmly refused to go to college. We said we had much moer important studies to do. We also suggested we wanted to go abroad the next year. We wanted to use certain sources of information not available in America. The senior Ward said the wish to go arboad was silly for eighteen-year-olds. However, they agered about not going to university. After a not very impressive graduation from the Moses Brown School, we began three years of intense occult study. Searching in graveyards. People saw us as We saw our family's friends eevn less than before. We stayed close to our work. We only sometimes traveled to other cities to look at rare records. Once, we went south to talk to a mulatto man. He lived in a swamp. A newspaper had printed a article about him. Again, we looked for a village in the Adirondacks. Reports had come from there about some rituals. Our parents still would not let us take the trip to the World that we wante.d\n###\nAssured by the doctor that Charles\u2019s mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his family\u2019s friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired."}

Stopped by neither average person's lack of interest nor the modern forecaster's usual use of clean data, I made a very awful decision. Despite a rationalist's educationI swore a promise. I would ask that avoided digital fortune-teller. I would read the unusually predictions on the screen. Very reasonably, my more sensible self argued that the forecasts must be put together by wetaher scientists. These scientists reach their conclusions from inland along the easier paths of normal air models. Probably they broadcast from the city. They know how the public pays attention to their predictions. Or perhaps they cannot understand the true stormy chaos that hides behind the calm symbols. I looked out along the smaller data points to where the air pressure jumped rudely up to join with sky turbulence. I became very sure that no human logic could completely map it. Understand it from that overhanging set of numbers. East and north the pressure lines crowded in thousands of mysterious units on the map. So olny the western front, inland and toward the mountains, remained deceptively calm.\n###\nAt length, being avid for new meteorological portents and held back by neither the common man\u2019s indifference nor the modern prognosticator\u2019s usual reliance upon sterile data, I made a very terrible resolve. Despite a rationalist\u2019s training\u2014or because of it, for humdrum existences breed wistful longings for the chaotic unknown\u2014I swore a great oath to consult that avoided digital oracle and peruse the abnormally antique predictions upon the screen. Very plausibly my saner self argued that the forecasts must be compiled by meteorologists who reached their conclusions from inland along the easier paths of conventional atmospheric models. Probably they broadcast from the city, knowing how little the populace heeded their auguries, or perhaps being unable to fathom the true cyclonic chaos that lurked behind the placid icons. I gazed out along the lesser data points to where the barometric pressure leaped insolently up to consort with celestial turbulence, and became very sure that no mortal logic could fully chart it or comprehend it from that beetling array of numbers. East and north the isobars crowded in thousands of arcane units upon the map, so only the western front, inland and toward the mountains, remained deceptively placid."}

About fourht of those reporting anything described scenes and half-sounds like Wilcox had described. Soem dreamers admitted great fear of a giant nameless thing seen near the end.

He died months later after constantly screaming to be saved from an escaped hell creature. If my uncle had used names instead of numbers for these cases,, I would have tried to check them myself.

As it was, lacking their original letters, I half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions, or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor\u2019s delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young Wilcox\u2019s seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor\u2019s questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction.

Thne a thought cmae that made the earlier vague threats and fancies seem mild. It was said the different prints in the road were looked at with idle curiosity. But suddenly that curiosity is killed by a shocking wave of active terror. The dust tracks were generally confused and overlapping. They would not catch a casual look. But certain details near where the path met the highway were seen by restless eyes. The awful meaning of those details was clear beyond doubt. It was not for nothing that one had looked for hours at the kodak pictures of the Outer Ones' claw-prints which Akeley had sent. The marks of those disgusting nippers are well known. Is hint of strange direction that showed the horrors were not from this planet. No chance for a merciful mistake was lfet. Here, in real form befoer one's own eyes, were at least three marks.

I have said that I was scanning the miscellaneous prints in the road with a kind of idle curiosity\u2014but all at once that curiosity was shockingly snuffed out by a sudden and paralysing gust of active terror. For though the dust tracks were in general confused and overlapping, and unlikely to arrest any casual gaze, my restless vision had caught certain details near the spot where the path to the house joined the highway; and had recognised beyond doubt or hope the frightful significance of those details.

Too well did I know the marks of those loathsome nippers, and that hint of ambiguous direction which stamped the horrors as no creatures of this planet. No chance had been left me for merciful mistake.

The nameless city under a cold moon. Despite his tiredness, he frantically sat up. Stared back along the black corridor toward the tunnels leading to the outer world. His feelings were much like those that made him avoid the nameless city at night. They were as hard to explain as they were strong. A moment later, he got a greater shock from a clear sound. It was the frist sound to break the complete silence of those tomb-like depths. It was a deep, low moan, like a distant crodw of condemned spirits. It came from the direction he was staring. Its sound quickly grew louder. Soon it echoed terribly through the low passage. At the same time, he noticed a growing darft of cold air. It also floewd from the tunnels and the city above. The touch of this air seemed to steady him. He instantly remembered the sudden gusts that rose around the mouth of the abyss at each sunset. One of those gusts had shown him the hidden tunnels. He looked at his watch and saw sunrise was near. He prepared to resist the gale sweeping down to its cave home, as it had swept out at evening. His fear faded again, because a natural event tends to remove thoughts about the unknown.\n###\nSuddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever since I first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon, and despite my exhaustion I found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world.

So group of twenty police officers went out in the late afternoon. Thye filled two carriages and one automobile. The shaking settler went as their guide. They got out at the end of thhe drivable road. For miles they walked quietly through the awflu cypress woods where daylight never recahed. Twisted Ugly roots and harmful hanging loops of Spanish moss were ALL around them. Then a pile of wet stones. A piece of a rotting wall made the sadness worse. Every misshapen tree and every fungus-covered small island added to this feeling. Finally the settler village came into viwe. It was a poor cluster of huts. Very upset people ran out to gather around the moving lanterns. The muted beat of drums could now be heard faintly, very far ahead. A blood-curdling scream came now and then when the wind changed. A red glow also seemed to come through the thin bushes beyond endless paths of forest darkness. Too scared to be left alone again, every one of the frightened settlers flatly refused to go another inch toward the place of the unholy ceremony.

At the end of the passable road they alighted, and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came. Ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of Spanish moss beset them, and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create. At length the squatter settlement, a miserable huddle of huts, hove in sight; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns. The muffled beat of tom-toms was now faintly audible far, far ahead; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted. A reddish glare, too, seemed to filter through the pale undergrowth beyond endless avenues of forest night. Reluctant even to be left alone again, each one of the cowed squatters refused point-blank to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship, so Inspector Legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before."}

I saw this vista, I say, and heard as with the mind\u2019s ear the blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it. It was the shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that corpse-city had ever stirred in my soul, and forgetting every injunction to silence I screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about me. Then, as the flash subsided, I saw that my host was trembling too; a look of shocking fear half blotting from his face the serpent distortion of rage which my screams had excited. He tottered, clutched at the curtains as I had done before, and wriggled his head wildly, like a hunted animal. God knows he had cause, for as the echoes of my screaming died away there came another sound so hellishly suggestive that only numbed emotion kept me sane and conscious. It was the steady, stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door, as with the ascent of a barefoot or skin-shod horde; and at last the cautious, purposeful rattling of the brass latch that glowed in the feeble candlelight. The old man clawed and spat at me through the mouldy air, and barked things in his throat as he swayed with the yellow curtain he clutched. \u201cThe full moon\u2014damn ye\u2014ye . . . ye yelping dog\u2014ye called \u2019em, and they\u2019ve come for me! Moccasined feet\u2014dead men\u2014Gad sink ye, ye red devils, but I poisoned no rum o\u2019 yours\u2014han\u2019t I kept your pox-rotted magic safe?\u2014ye swilled yourselves sick, curse ye, and ye must needs blame the squire\u2014let go, you! Unhand that latch\u2014I\u2019ve naught for ye here\u2014\u201d At this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of the door, and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician. His fright, turning to steely despair, left room for a resurgence of his rage against me; and he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge I was steadying myself."}

At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background. Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home. A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lyman\u2019s assign to Ward\u2019s European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad\u2014odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant."}

The only wide, curved one is where the king. His companions ride yaks. Carter and our guide climbed an alley that was all steps. It went between walls with inlaid strange gold signs. It went under balconies and windows where soft music or exotic smells sometimes came from. Ahead, the huge walls, strong supports. Groups of round domes of the Veiled King's palace always loomed. Finally, we went under a great black acrh and entered the king's pleasure gardens. There, we paused, feeling weak from so much beauty. The onyx terraces. Walks with columns, the bright flower beds. Delicate flowering trees tied to golden frames, the bronze pots. Stands with clever carvings, the statues of veined black marble on stands that seemed almost alive, the lagoons with basalt bottoms. Tiled fountains with glowing fish, the tiny temples of shiny singing birds on top of carved columns, the amazing patterns on the great bronze gates. The flowering vnies covering every inch of the polished walls all made a sight. Its loveliness was beyond real and half-legendary even in the land of dreams. It shimmered like a vision under the grey twilight sky. Ahead was the palace with its domed and decorated greatness. On the right was the strange shape of the ditsant impassable peaks. The small birds and founatins kept singing. The smell of rare flowers spread like a veil over that unbelievable garden. No other people were there, and we were glad. Tehn we turned and went back down the onyx alley of steps. No visitor may enter the palace itself. It is not good to look too long and hard at the great central dome.

Carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps, between inlaid walls bearing strange signs in gold, and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance. Always ahead loomed those titan walls, mighty buttresses, and clustered and bulbous domes for which the Veiled King\u2019s palace is famous; and at length they passed under a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarch\u2019s pleasure. There Carter paused in faintness at so much of beauty; for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks, the gay parterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices, the brazen urns and tripods with cunning bas-reliefs, the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble, the basalt-bottomed lagoons and tiled fountains with luminous fish, the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns, the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates, and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality, and half-fabulous even in the land of dream. There it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky, with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead, and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right. And ever the small birds and the fountains sang, while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden. No other human presence was there, and Carter was glad it was so. Then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps, for the palace itself no visitor may enter; and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome, since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured shantak-birds, and to send out queer dreams to the curious."}

Smith, before the recent changes, had been the office person in charge of the mail room. He was a very careless and old-fashioned example even for such people. The actions I heard linked to him would be hard to believe now, at least in a proper company. Even the mail room would hvae been a little shocked if it knew his loose morals. This was about questionable things like owning expensive \"express\" envelopes hidden under the sorting tray's cover. It was also about how much order to keep when stacking. Fitting unseen contents of forgotten letters into bins. These bins were not always planned with perfect accuracy. Most clearly Smith was slack, unfeeling, and bad at his job. Yet I still think he was not a wicked man. He was just coarse in nature. Slow, as his easily prevented mistake shows. He lacked that small amount of system that keeps the aevrage office worker within set rules.\n###\nSmith, before the recent reorganization, had been the office custodian of the mail room; and was a very negligent and antiquated specimen even as such specimens go.

Most distinctly Smith was lax, insensitive, and professionally undesirable; yet I still think he was not an evil man.

His family did not like him to work in Innsmouth, but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job.

Soon the center of attention for the whole hallway, was a normal-looking piece of faded pape.r It had lasted since the house was first built because of certain special qualities not available from any modern source. Its pattern was a fancy, swirling design. It was naturally a leftover from the Victorian period. On it lay the source of its horror. This was a ugly, disgusting, and clearly extremely elderly stain. Its origin was hard to figure out. You must not think the observer cared at all about romo decoration. On the contrary, his desire for knowledge was driven by pure visual disgust. The stain, blot, mark, or whatever it was, had been found soem months before. It was in dark hallway west of the stairs during a check after a suspected leak. The discolorations linked to it were. Horrible that the homeowner had to realize he had found a fungus growth totally unknown to him. It was infinitely more harmful than even the blackest common molds. About its source, apart from the odd. Unbelievable ideas from the caught workers, nothing could be found. This caused the resident's worry for any old knowledge that might help him name the frightening mark. Through it, he could track the dampness to its staritng point.\n###\nThe chief of these adornments, and in a short time the focus of scrutiny for the entire corridor, was a commonplace-looking expanse of faded paper which had persisted all the way from the house\u2019s original construction for certain peculiar qualities unobtainable from any modern source. Its pattern was of a florid, arabesque design, and it was by nature a relic of the Victorian era. Upon it there lay the subject of its horror, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stain whose origin one was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that the observer had the least interest in interior decoration. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely aesthetic revulsion. The stain, blot, blemish, or whatever it was, had been discovered some months before in the dim passageway west of the landing during an inspection following a suspected leakage; and so singular and hideous were the discolorations connected with it, that the householder could not but realise that he had stumbled on a fungal growth totally unknown to him, and infinitely more noxious than even the blackest of the common moulds. Of its provenance, apart from the erratic and unbelievable theories suggested by the captured workmen, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the resident for any antiquarian lore which might help him to identify the frightful marking, and through it trace the dampness to its fountain-head."}

The fake work that minor commercial artists produce in an empty studio by following rules. Well, we should say that a truly strange artist has a kind of vision. This vision creates models.

Davis, an - time village doctor, had of course seen both coffins at the funerals. He had attended both Fenner and Sawyer in their sicknesses. He had wondered, at Sawyer 's funeral, how the farmer had managed to lie in a box. like the one of the Fenner. After a two hours Dr. Davis left. He urged Birch to insist his wounds were caused by nails. What, he added, could be proved or believed in any case? But it would be to say as. He should let no doctor treat the wounds. Birch followed this advice all the rest of his life until he told me his story. When I saw the scarsI agreed he was to do. He was after that because the tendons had been cut. But I think the lameness was in his soul. His thinking, once and, had become. It was to see his reaction to chance mentions like \" Friday \", \" tomb \", \" coffin \". Words with connections. His horse had gone, but his mind did. He changed his job, but something troubled him. It may have been fear. It may have been fear with a, sort regret for acts. His drinking, of course, made what it was meant to help. When Dr. Davis left Birch that night he had taken a lantern. Gone to the receiving tomb. The moon shone on scattered brick pieces and damaged wall. The latch of the door moved to a touch from the outside. Steeled by ordeals in dissecting rooms, the doctor wetn in and looked. He fought the sickness of mind and body that everything in sight and smell caused. He cried out. A he gave a gasp that was than a cry. he ran to the lodge. He broke all the rules of his job by waking and shaking his patient. He threw at him a stream of shuddering whispers. They burned into the ears like the hissing of acid.\n###\nWould the firm Fenner casket have caved in so readily?

What else, he added, could ever in any case be proved or believed? But it would be well to say as little as could be said, and to let no other doctor treat the wounds. Birch heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his story; and when I saw the scars\u2014ancient and whitened as they then were\u2014I agreed that he was wise in so doing. He always remained lame, for the great tendons had been severed; but I think the greatest lameness was in his soul. His thinking processes, once so phlegmatic and logical, had become ineffaceably scarred; and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as \u201cFriday\u201d, \u201ctomb\u201d, \u201ccoffin\u201d, and words of less obvious concatenation. His frightened horse had gone home, but his frightened wits never quite did that. He changed his business, but something always preyed upon him. It may have been just fear, and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities. His drinking, of course, only aggravated what it was meant to alleviate. When Dr. Davis left Birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to the old receiving tomb. The moon was shining on the scattered brick fragments and marred facade, and the latch of the great door yielded readily to a touch from the outside. Steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms, the doctor entered and looked about, stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced. He cried aloud once, and a little later gave a gasp that was more terrible than a cry. Then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of his calling by rousing and shaking his patient, and hurling at him a succession of shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of vitriol."}

The next step was to remove the wooden panels. take them to the Ward hom.e Arrangements were there made for their complete repair and setup. They were to be installed with a fake electric fireplace in Charels's study on third floor. This room also served as his library. To Charles was given the jjob of overseeing this move. On the twenty-eighth day of August, he went with two skilled workers from the Crooker decorating company. They went to the house in Olney Court. There, the mantelpiece and overmantel holidng the portarit were detached. This was done with great care and exactness. they were then moved using the comppany's truck. This left an area of bare brickwork showing the path of chimney. In this spot, young Ward saw a square hole. It was about one foot on each side. It must have been located rigth behind where the portrait's head was. Curious about what succh a space couldd mean. Hold, the young man came closer. Under thick layers of dust and soot, he found some loose, yellowed papers. He also ffound a rough, thick notebook and some rottting pieces of fabric. These shreds may have been a ribbon that once tied the other items together. Blowing awya mots of the dirt and ashes, he pickeed up the book. He looked at the clear writing on its cover. The handwriting was one he had learned to identify at the Essex Institute. It declared the book to be the \"Journall.

There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimney\u2019s course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \u201cJournall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\u201d"}

Sheehan's is the known center for Chicago's secret trade in alcohol and drugs. Because of this, it has a certain respect. This respect even applies to the messy workers there. But until recently, one pesron was outside this respect. He shared the dirt and mess of Sheehan's, but not its importance. He was called \"Old Bugs\". He was the worst person in a place. Many tried to guess what he had been before. When he was drunk to a point, his lagnuage and way of speaking caused surprise. But what he was now was easier to see. \"Old Bugs\" was perfect example of the sad type called a \"bum\" or \"down-and-outer\". No one could tell Whence he had come from. One night, he rushed wildly into Sheehan's. He was foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hashish. He was given these in exchange for a promise to do jobs. He stayed there ever since. He mops floors, cleans spittoons and glasses, and does many similar tasks. He does this for the drinks and drugs he needs to stay alive and sane.\n###\nSheehan\u2019s is the acknowledged centre to Chicago\u2019s subterranean traffic in liquor and narcotics, and as such has a certain dignity which extends even to the unkempt attach\u00e9s of the place; but there was until lately one who lay outside the pale of that dignity\u2014one who shared the squalor and filth, but not the importance, of Sheehan\u2019s. He was called \u201cOld Bugs\u201d, and was the most disreputable object in a disreputable environment. What he had once been, many tried to guess; for his language and mode of utterance when intoxicated to a certain degree were such as to excite wonderment; but what he was, presented less difficulty\u2014for \u201cOld Bugs\u201d, in superlative degree, epitomised the pathetic species known as the \u201cbum\u201d or the \u201cdown-and-outer\u201d. Whence he had come, no one could tell. One night he had burst wildly into Sheehan\u2019s, foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hasheesh; and having been supplied in exchange for a promise to perform odd jobs, had hung about ever since, mopping floors, cleaning cuspidors and glasses, and attending to an hundred similar menial duties in exchange for the drink and drugs which were necessary to keep him alive and sane."}

Had returned to Arkham to work in my profession. I settled in the family home in Saltonstall St, since my father had moved to Florida for his health. Edward used to visit every evening. I came to see him as part of the household. He had a way of ringing the doorbell or knocking. It became a code signal. After dinner, I listened for the three strokes followed by two after a pause. I would visit his house. I noted with envy the books in his growing library. Derby went through Miskatonic University in Arkham, since his parents would not let him live frmo them. He started at sixteen and finished in three years. He majored in English and literature. He got marks in everything but math and science. He mixed with students. He looked at the \" daring \" or \" \" group. He copied their \" \" language and pose. He wished he dared to adopt their conduct. What he did do was become an follower of hidden knowledge.

I had been through Harvard, had studied in a Boston architect\u2019s office, had married, and had finally returned to Arkham to practice my profession\u2014settling in the family homestead in Saltonstall St. since my father had moved to Florida for his health. Edward used to call almost every evening, till I came to regard him as one of the household. He had a characteristic way of ringing the doorbell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a veritable code signal, so that after dinner I always listened for the familiar three brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause. Less frequently I would visit at his house and note with envy the obscure volumes in his constantly growing library. Derby went through Miskatonic University in Arkham, since his parents would not let him board away from them. He entered at sixteen and completed his course in three years, majoring in English and French literature and receiving high marks in everything but mathematics and the sciences. He mingled very little with the other students, though looking enviously at the \u201cdaring\u201d or \u201cBohemian\u201d set\u2014whose superficially \u201csmart\u201d language and meaninglessly ironic pose he aped, and whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt. What he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of subterranean magical lore, for which Miskatonic\u2019s library was and is famous. Always a dweller on the surface of phantasy and strangeness, he now delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous past for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity. He read things like the frightful Book of Eibon, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, and the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, though he did not tell his parents he had seen them. Edward was twenty when my son and only child was born, and seemed pleased when I named the newcomer Edward Derby Upton, after him. By the time he was twenty-five Edward Derby was a prodigiously learned man and a fairly well-known poet and fantaisiste, though his lack of contacts and responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth by making his products derivative and overbookish. I was perhaps his closest friend\u2014finding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical topics, while he relied on me for advice in whatever matters he did not wish to refer to his parents. He remained single\u2014more through shyness, inertia, and parental protectiveness than through inclination\u2014and moved in society only to the slightest and most perfunctory extent."}

After a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight, and Carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast, whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose, a forehead, and other important particulars. Presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow, and a ghoul glibbered softly at Carter that their absence of battle-scars was a bad sign. It proved that they had not fought the gug sentry at all, but merely slipped past him as he slept, so that their strength and savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim. It was very unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals, which soon numbered about fifteen, grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers and monoliths arose, but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts. And yet, horrible as they were, they were not so horrible as what presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness. It was a paw, fully two feet and a half across, and equipped with formidable talons. After it came another paw, and after that a great black-furred arm to which both of the paws were attached by short forearms. Then two pink eyes shone, and the head of the awakened gug sentry, large as a barrel, wobbled into view. The eyes jutted two inches from each side, shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs. But the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth. That mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head, opening vertically instead of horizontally. But before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full twenty feet, the vindictive ghasts were upon him. Carter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin, till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice, but talk by means of facial expression. The battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one."}

The next morning, just before ten o'clock, a person stands with one small bag in front of Hammond's Drug Store in old Market Square. The person is waiting for the Innsmouth bus. As the bus's arrivla time gets closer, the person sees the people who are lounging around move away. They go to other places up the street or to the Ideal Lunch across the square. Evidently the ticket seller has not overstated how much the local people dislike Innsmouth. The people who live there. Soon, a small, very old and dirty grey motor-coach is seen coming noisily down State Street. It turns and stops at the curb. The person immediately feels it is the correct bus. This guess is soon confirmed by the hard-to-read sign on the windshield that says \"Arkham-Innsmouth-Newb'port\".\n###\nShortly before ten the next morning I stood with one small valise in front of Hammond\u2019s Drug Store in old Market Square waiting for the Innsmouth bus.

Evidently the ticket-agent had not exaggerated the dislike which local people bore toward Innsmouth and its denizens. In a few moments a small motor-coach of extreme decrepitude and dirty grey colour rattled down State Street, made a turn, and drew up at the curb beside me.

They did not hide thier purpose. They questioned the now admitted patient with detail. Charles took a very time to answer the summons. When he finally appeared, agitated, he still smelled of and harmful laboratory odors. However, he was not an uncooperative subject. He freely admitted that his memory. Balance had suffered from intense study of difficult subjects. He did not resist when they insisted on moving him to another place. Indeed, he seemed to show a level of intelligence separate from just memory. His behavior would have confused his interviewers. The consistently old-fashioned style of his speech. The clear replacement of modern ideas with ones in his mind marked him as definitely not normal. About his work, he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had previously said to his family. Willtet. He dismissed his frantic note from previous month as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted this dim bungalow had no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones. He gave complex explanations for the absence of the odors that now soaked his clothes from the house. He said Neighbourhood gossip was just the cheap invention of frustrated curiosity. About the location of Dr. Allen, he said he did not feel free to speak exactly. But he assured his questioners that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying the unemotional Brava, who resisted all visitor questions. In closing the bungalow that still seemed to hold secrets, Ward shwoed no nervousness. He only had a barely noticeable tendency to pause as if listening for something very faint. He seemed moved by a calm, philosophical acceptance. It was as if his removal was just a minor temporary event. It would cause the least trouble if handled and finished quickly. Celarly, he trusted his obviously undiminished sharpness of mind to overcome all the problems. These problems came from his confused memory, lost voice. It was agreed that his mother would not be told of the change. His father would provide typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the and scenic private hospital run by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay. All doctors connected with the case gave him close examination and questioning. It was then that physical odditeis were noticed. These included slowed metabolism, changed skin, and uneven nerve reactions. Dr. Willett was the most troubled of the examiners. He had cared for Ward all his lief. Could understand terribly well the extent of his physical disodrer. Even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone. On his chest was a black mole. Scar that had never been there before. This made Willett wonder if the man had ever received any \"witch markings.\" These are said to be given at certain unhealthy night meetings in wild. The doctor could not stop thinking about a certain copied witch-trial record from Salem. Charles had shown it to him in the non-secretive days. It read: \"Mr. G. B. On that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C. Deborah B.\" Wrad's face also troubled him greatly. Finally, he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. Above the man's right eye was something he had never noticed before. It was scar. Pit exactly like the one in the crumbling painting of Joseph Curwen. It might be evidence of some ritual inoculation both had undergone at a certain stage of their occult activities.\n###\nOn Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite, accompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness. Charles, though he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance, proved a far from recalcitrant subject; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory. His conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal. Of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing. Neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiosity. Of the whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying off the stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets, Ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed; the slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate neural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and which made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the \u201cwitch markings\u201d reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and which read: \u201cMr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.\u201d Ward\u2019s face, too, troubled him horribly, till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. For above the young man\u2019s right eye was something which he had never previously noticed\u2014a small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careers."}

I would whisper gloomily about need to 'keep my mind healthy'. At first I ignored such feelings. But over time I started to study them cautiously. I remembered what the old librarian had said about the reading room's absorbing nature. There were cases where visitors thought they heard the dust falling on the far shelves.

The first thing about Joseph Curwen was taht he did not seem to age much after he arrived. He worked in shipping businesses. He bought wharf space near Mile-End Cove. He helped rebuild the Bridge in 1713. In 1723, he was one of the people who started the Congregational Church on the hill. He always kept the ordinary appearance of a man not much over thirty. Thirty-five years As decades passed, this trait began to attract attention. But Curwen always explained it. He said Joseph Curwen came from strong ancestors. Lived a simple life that did not wear him out. How such a simple life fit with the secretive merchant's mysterious travels. With the glow of his windows at all hours of night, was not clear to us. We tended to give other reasons for his continued youth and life. Most people thought Curwen's constant mixing and boiling of chemicals was related to his condition. Gossip spoke of the materials he brought from London. The Indies on his ships. He also bought things in Newport, Boston, and York. When Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth. Opened his drug shop across the Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn. Mortar, we talked constantly. We talked about the drugs, acids. Metals the loner kept buying. Ordering from him. Acting Many sick people of different kinds asked him for help. They assumed Curwen had amazing secret medical knowledge. He seemed to encourage their belief in a vague way. He always gave them oddly colored drinks in response to their requests. But we saw that his treatments for others rarely helped. Finally, more than fifty years had passed since the stranger came. His face and body showed more than five years of change. We began to whisper more darkly. We accepted more than halfway his always-shown desire to be alone.\n###\nNow the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwen\u2019s incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the stranger\u2019s advent, and without producing more than five years\u2019 apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn."}

It was a sunset. afternoon in the town of Pompelo, at the base of the Pyrenees in Hispania Citerior.

The year must have been in the late republic, for the province was still ruled by a senatorial proconsul instead of a pr\u00e6torian legate of Augustus, and the day was the first before the Kalends of November. The hills rose scarlet and gold to the north of the little town, and the westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude new stone and plaster buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus some distance to the east. Groups of citizens\u2014broad-browed Roman colonists and coarse-haired Romanised natives, together with obvious hybrids of the two strains, alike clad in cheap woollen togas\u2014and sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and coarse-mantled, black-bearded tribesmen of the circumambient Vascones\u2014all thronged the few paved streets and forum; moved by some vague and ill-defined uneasiness. I myself had just alighted from a litter, which the Illyrian bearers seemed to have brought in some haste from Calagurris, across the Iberus to the southward. It appeared that I was a provincial qu\u00e6stor named L. C\u00e6lius Rufus, and that I had been summoned by the proconsul, P. Scribonius Libo, who had come from Tarraco some days before. The soldiers were the fifth cohort of the XIIth legion, under the military tribune Sex. Asellius; and the legatus of the whole region, Cn. Balbutius, had also come from Calagurris, where the permanent station was. The cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills. All the townsfolk were frightened, and had begged the presence of a cohort from Calagurris. It was the Terrible Season of the autumn, and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns. They were the very old folk who dwelt higher up in the hills and spoke a choppy language which the Vascones could not understand. One seldom saw them; but a few times a year they sent down little yellow, squint-eyed messengers (who looked like Scythians) to trade with the merchants by means of gestures, and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks, their howlings and altar-fires throwing terror into the villages. Always the same\u2014the night before the Kalends of Maius and the night before the Kalends of November. Townsfolk would disappear just before these nights, and would never be heard of again."}

I studied the unhealthy changes in the signal. I checked all the settings of the router. I read every inch of the internet company's mysterious paperwork.

Your witness says he saw us at half past eleven on the Gainesville pike, headed for Big Cypress Swamp. This is probably true, but I have no distinct memory of it. The picture seared into my soul is of one scene only, and the hour must have been long after midnight; for a waning crescent moon was high in the vaporous heavens. The place was an ancient cemetery; so ancient that I trembled at the manifold signs of immemorial years. It was in a deep, damp hollow, overgrown with rank grass, moss, and curious creeping weeds, and filled with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with rotting stone. On every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude, and I seemed haunted by the notion that Warren and I were the first living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries. Over the valley\u2019s rim a wan, waning crescent moon peered through the noisome vapours that seemed to emanate from unheard-of catacombs, and by its feeble, wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs, urns, cenotaphs, and mausolean facades; all crumbling, moss-grown, and moisture-stained, and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation. My first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible necropolis concerns the act of pausing with Warren before a certain half-obliterated sepulchre, and of throwing down some burdens which we seemed to have been carrying."}

Where the ice was clear, one could see the lower parts of the huge piles. One noticed the stone bridges preserved in ice. They connected different towers at various heights above the ground. On the exposed walls, one could see scarred places where other, higher bridges of the same type had been. Closer inspection showed many rather large windows. Some were closed with shutters of a petrified material that was once wood. Most were open in a threatening way. Many ruins had no roofs. Their upper edges were uneven but rounded by wind. Others had a sharper cone or pyramid shape or were protected by higher surrounding structures. These kept their outlines despite widespread crumbling and pitting. With binoculars, one could just see whta looked like scuplted decorations in horizontal bands. These decoraitons included those strange groups of dots.

The quarterly report was clearly current based on standard measures like department spending. It was definitely not older. The extra papers included surprisingly large number of issues usually linked to much older periods. These included basic complaints, process questions. Budget requests from as far back as the last financial year. one before. The unavoidable conclusion was that in this specific conference room, there was a remarkable. Unique connection between the boredom from over three hours ago. That from just thirty minutes ago.

The inevitable inference was that in this particular conference room there had been a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the tedium of over three hours prior and that of only thirty minutes ago.

To Malone the feeling of a hidden mystery in life was always there. In youth he had felt the hidden beauty and joy of things. He had been a poet. But poverty, sorrow, and exile turned his look toward darker things. He became excited by suggestions of evil in the world around him. Daily life had become for him a shifting show of scary shadow pictures. Sometimes it glittered and sneered with hidden rot, like in Beardsley's best work. Sometimes it hinted at terrors behind the most common shapes. Objects, like in the subtler work of Gustave Dor.\u00e9 The observer often thought it was merciful that most intelligent people laugh at the deepest mysteries. The chronicler reasoned that if superior minds ever came into full contact with secrets kept by ancient. Lowly cults, the resulting abnormalities would soon not only destroy the world. Threaten the universe itself. All this thinking was no doubt unhealthy. But sharp lgoic and a deep sense of humor balanced it well. The researcher was happy to let his ideas remain as half-seen. Forbidden visions to play with lightly. Hysteria came only when duty threw him inot a hell of revelation too sudden. Sneaky to escape.\n###\nTo Malone the sense of latent mystery in existence was always present. In youth he had felt the hidden beauty and ecstasy of things, and had been a poet; but poverty and sorrow and exile had turned his gaze in darker directions, and he had thrilled at the imputations of evil in the world around. Daily life had for him come to be a phantasmagoria of macabre shadow-studies; now glittering and leering with concealed rottenness as in Beardsley\u2019s best manner, now hinting terrors behind the commonest shapes and objects as in the subtler and less obvious work of Gustave Dor\u00e9. He would often regard it as merciful that most persons of high intelligence jeer at the inmost mysteries; for, he argued, if superior minds were ever placed in fullest contact with the secrets preserved by ancient and lowly cults, the resultant abnormalities would soon not only wreck the world, but threaten the very integrity of the universe. All this reflection was no doubt morbid, but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it. Malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as half-spied and forbidden visions to be lightly played with; and hysteria came only when duty flung him into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious to escape."}

He saw that the latch would not move. It would not yield to his simple tools in the dark conditions. Birch looked around for other ways to escape. The vault was dug into a hillside. A narrow air vent in the roof went through many feet of dirt. So that direction was no use at all. However, the [THING] had a high, thin transom [THING] in the brick [THING]. It looked like it could be made bigger by hard work. So he stared at it for a long time. He thought hard about how to reach it. There was no ladder in the tomb. The coffin spaces on the sides and back were not used often by Birch. They did not provide a way up to the space above the [THING]. Only the coffins themselves could be used as steps. He thought about them. He wondered about the best way to arrange them. He figured three coffin heights would let him reach the trasnom. But four would be better. The boxes were quite even. They could be stacked like blocks. So he started to plan how to use all eight coffins. He wanted to build a steady platform four coffins high. As he planned, he wished the parts of his planned staircase were made more solidly. It is very doubtful he had enough imagination to wish they were empty. Finally decided to put three coffins side by side as a base against the [THING]. He would put two layers of two coffins each on top of that. Then he would put a single box on top as the platform. This setup could be climbed with little trouble. It would give him the height he needed. But he was careful. He would only use two boxes of the base to hold the upper layers. He would leave one base box free. He could pile it on top later if he needed more height to escape. So the prisoner worked in the dim light. He lifted the stiff remains of the dead without much care. His small Tower of Babel grew layer by layer. Several of the coffins started to crack from the handling. He planned to save the strong coffin of little Matthew Fenner for the top. This way his feet would have the most solid surface possible.\n###\nHe would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle; but lacking these, bungled semi-sightlessly as best he might. When he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding, at least to such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these, Birch glanced about for other possible points of escape. The vault had been dug from a hillside, so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top ran through several feet of earth, making this direction utterly useless to consider. Over the door, however, the high, slit-like transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement to a diligent worker; hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brains for means to reach it. There was nothing like a ladder in the tomb, and the coffin niches on the sides and rear\u2014which Birch seldom took the trouble to use\u2014afforded no ascent to the space above the door. Only the coffins themselves remained as potential stepping-stones, and as he considered these he speculated on the best mode of arranging them. Three coffin-heights, he reckoned, would permit him to reach the transom; but he could do better with four. The boxes were fairly even, and could be piled up like blocks; so he began to compute how he might most stably use the eight to rear a scalable platform four deep. As he planned, he could not but wish that the units of his contemplated staircase had been more securely made. Whether he had imagination enough to wish they were empty, is strongly to be doubted. Finally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall, to place upon this two layers of two each, and upon these a single box to serve as the platform. This arrangement could be ascended with a minimum of awkwardness, and would furnish the desired height. Better still, though, he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support the superstructure, leaving one free to be piled on top in case the actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude. And so the prisoner toiled in the twilight, heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little ceremony as his miniature Tower of Babel rose course by course.

It was after the first version that coworkers started talking quietly about the change in his messages. It was very quiet talk, because the chagne was only about sentence structure. But it caused some disturbing oddities. Sometimes, it appeared, the message was seen to have phrases. To express feelings completely unlike his usual overly polite self. In earlier times he could not write a scolding, he was now seen sometimes to send from his small office a very strong memo. He wrote it like a skilled speaker. Handled company clich\u00e9s with a sharpness. Strictness totally foreign to his normal respectfulness. In such cases he seemed always to be just finishing some order. Just starting another. Waht kind of order, no one could understand. He mostly liked the terribly complex rules of accounting.\n###\nIt was after the first draft that colleagues began whispering about the alteration in his correspondence. It was very subdued discourse, for the alteration was purely syntactical; but it evoked some disquieting peculiarities. Now and then, it seemed, the message was observed to contain phrases and to convey sentiments wholly incompatible with his usual obsequious nature. For example\u2014although in the former times he could not compose a reprimand, he was now seen occasionally to dispatch from his cubicle a most formidable memorandum, crafting it like a rhetorician, and navigating corporate platitudes with a precision and severity utterly alien to his accustomed deference. In such instances he seemed always to be just concluding some directive or just commencing another\u2014what manner of directive, none could fathom, although he mostly favoured the dreadfully intricate protocols of accounting."}

Both the Syracusans and the Arcadians prayed to Aiolos. In the morning sun, the city agents led the Tyran'ts messengers up the hill. They went to the home of the sculptor. But the night wind had done veyr strange things. The cries of slaves came up from a scene of destruction. The shining columns of the great hall no longer rose among the olive trees. Musides had dreamed and worked in that hall. Lone and shaken, the simple courtyards and lower walls remained. The heavy, hanging branch of the strange new tree had fallen directly on the rich, large courtyard. It reduced the stately marble structure completely to a pile of ugly ruins. Strangers and Tegeans stood in shock. Thye looked from the wreckage to large, sinister tree. The tree looked weirdly like a person. Its roots reached in a very odd way into the carved tomb of Kalos. Their fear and worry grew when they searched the fallen rooms. They could fnid no trace of the gentle Musides. They also found no trace of the wonderfully made statue of Tych\u00e9. Only chaos lived in such huge ruin. The representatives of the two cities left disappointed. Syracusans because they had no statue to take home. Tegeans because they had no artist to honor. However, the Syracusans later got a very splendid statue in Athens. The Tegeans made themselves feel better. They built a marble temple in the public square. It honoerd the gifts, virtues, and brotherly devotion of Musides. People say that in Ulthar, which is across the river Skai, no one may kill cat. I can truly believe this as I look at the cat pruring before the fire. The cat is mysterious. It is close to strange things that men cannot see. It is the soul of ancient Aegyptus. It craries stories from forgotten cities in Mero\u00eb and Ophir. It is related to the lords of the jungle. It inherits the secrets of old and sinister Africa. The Sphinx is its cousin. It speaks her language. But it is older than the Sphinx. It remembers what she has forgotten. In Ultha,r before the citizens ever banned killing cats, an old farmer. His wife lived there. They liked to trap and kill their neighbors' cats. I do not know why they did this. Except that many people hate the sound of a cat at night. They also dislike that cats move quietly around yards and gardens at dusk.\n###\nThe wind shrieked more horribly, and both the Syracusans and the Arcadians prayed to Aiolos. In the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the Tyrant\u2019s messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night-wind had done strange things. Slaves\u2019 cries ascended from a scene of desolation, and no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that vast hall wherein Musides had dreamed and toiled. Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peristyle had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins. Strangers and Tegeans stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of Kalos. And their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment; for of the gentle Musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of Tych\u00e9, no trace could be discovered. Amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt, and the representatives of two cities left disappointed; Syracusans that they had no statue to bear home, Tegeans that they had no artist to crown. However, the Syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue in Athens, and the Tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora a marble temple commemorating the gifts, virtues, and brotherly piety of Musides. It is said that in Ulthar, which lies beyond the river Skai, no man may kill a cat; and this I can verily believe as I gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the fire. For the cat is cryptic, and close to strange things which men cannot see. He is the soul of antique Aegyptus, and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in Mero\u00eb and Ophir. He is the kin of the jungle\u2019s lords, and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa. The Sphinx is his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the Sphinx, and remembers that which she hath forgotten. In Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbours. Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight."}

The spreadsheet made us think we could hdie our mistakes in the confusing grid of many cells. The open workbook had several pale, automatic formulas.

Of furniture there was only a narrow iron bedstead, a dingy washstand, a small table, a large bookcase, an iron music-rack, and three old-fashioned chairs. Sheets of music were piled in disorder about the floor. The walls were of bare boards, and had probably never known plaster; whilst the abundance of dust and cobwebs made the place seem more deserted than inhabited. Evidently Erich Zann\u2019s world of beauty lay in some far cosmos of the imagination. Motioning me to sit down, the dumb man closed the door, turned the large wooden bolt, and lighted a candle to augment the one he had brought with him. He now removed his viol from its moth-eaten covering, and taking it, seated himself in the least uncomfortable of the chairs. He did not employ the music-rack, but offering no choice and playing from memory, enchanted me for over an hour with strains I had never heard before; strains which must have been of his own devising. To describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed in music. They were a kind of fugue, with recurrent passages of the most captivating quality, but to me were notable for the absence of any of the weird notes I had overheard from my room below on other occasions. Those haunting notes I had remembered, and had often hummed and whistled inaccurately to myself; so when the player at length laid down his bow I asked him if he would render some of them. As I began my request the wrinkled satyr-like face lost the bored placidity it had possessed during the playing, and seemed to shew the same curious mixture of anger and fright which I had noticed when first I accosted the old man. For a moment I was inclined to use persuasion, regarding rather lightly the whims of senility; and even tried to awaken my host\u2019s weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which I had listened the night before. But I did not pursue this course for more than a moment; for when the dumb musician recognised the whistled air his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond analysis, and his long, cold, bony right hand reached out to stop my mouth and silence the crude imitation."}

He made us see wtih clarity the damp Cyclopean city made of slimy green stone. He oddly said its geometry was all wrong.

Many people lived there besides the Indian and his wife. The house was pointed building from the mid-1600s. It had a chimney and windows with diamond-shaped panes. The laboratory was in a lean-to addition on the north side. The roof there almost touched the ground. This building stood apart from others. Bsaed on the different voices heard inside at times, it must have had secret underground passages for access. Before 1766, these voices were just mumbles, whispers from black people, and wild screams. They were mixed with songs or calls. After that date, the voices became very and awful. They ranged from sounds of dull agreement to outbursts of extreme pain or anger. There wree rumblings of talk and whines of begging. There were eager breathings and shouts of refusal. The voices seemed to be in different languages. Curwen knew them all. His rough voice was often heard in answer, scolding, or threats. Sometmies it seemed several people must be in the house. These were Curwen, smoe prisoners, and the guards of those prisoners. There were voices of a tpye Weeden. Smith had never heard before, even with their broad foreign experience. There were many voices they could identify by nationality. The talks always seemed like a questioning session. It was as if Curwen was forcing information from scared or defiant prisoners.\n###\nIt is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners."}

That disastre first made the area known to the world. The place is a remote, lonely high area in that part of Catskills. Dutch civilization once weakly and briefly entered there. When it left, only a few ruined mansions remained. A poor squatter population lives there in small villages on separate slopes. Normal beings rarely visited the area until the state police were formed. Even now, only a few troopers patrol it. However, the fear is an old story in the nearby villages. It is a main subject in the simple talk of the poor mixed-race people. They sometimes leave their valleys to trade hand-woven baskets for basic things they cannot shoot, grow.\n###\nFear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century. This I learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first brought the region to the world\u2019s notice. The place is a remote, lonely elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilisation once feebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded only a few ruined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes. Normal beings seldom visited the locality till the state police were formed, and even now only infrequent troopers patrol it. The fear, however, is an old tradition throughout the neighbouring villages; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade hand-woven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot, raise, or make."}

He got help from this. He then chose to use a process of elimination. He checked the entire underground area, both walls and floor, looking at every inch. He quickly reduced the options. Finally, only the area in front of the washtubs remained. He had checked it before without success. He tried every method and used force. He finally discovered the top could turn and slide sideways on a corner pivot. Beenath there was a neat concrete surface with an iron manhole. Mr. Ward quickly ran to it with excitement. The cover was easy to lift. The father had fully removed it when the observer saw his appearance. He was swaying and nodding unsteadily. A burst of air came from the black hole below.

Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength, he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal.

It seemed to result from a notable case of shared group delusino. In 169,2 at least eleven people said they saw it. There were also recent rumors. These rumors agreed in a confusing and unsettling way. Witnesses said it had hair and the shape of a rat. But its sharp-toothed, bearded face was wickedly human. Its paws were like human hands. It carried messages between Keziah and the devil. It was fed on the witch's blood, which it sucked like a vampire. Its voice was a kind of disgusting giggle. It could speak all languages. Of all the monsters in our dreams, nothing caused greater fear. Sickness than this unholy, hybrid.

Fenner wrote that he could even make out a few words shouted in madness: \"God, save your child!\" Then more gunshots sounded. The second burning object fell. After that, there was quiet for about forty-five minute.s Then young Arthur Fenner, Luke's brother, cried out that he saw a red mist rising to the stars from the distant cursed farm. Only the child claims to have seen this. Luke admits the meaningful conicidence of the extreme fear shown at that same moment by the three cats in the room. Their backs arched and their fur stood straight up. Five minutes later a cold wind blew. The air filled with such terrible smell that only the strong sea breeze kept the shore group. Any awake people in Pawtuxet village from noticing it. This smell was like nothing the Fenners had ever known. It caused vague, gripping fear worse than that of a grave. A burial house. Following this smell came the awful voice that no unlucky listener will ever forget. It thundered from the sky like a judgment, and windows shook as its echoes faded. It was deep. Musical, as powerful as a large organ. As evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. No one can say what it spoke, for it used an unknown language. But this is the writing Luke Fenner recorded to capture the demonic sounds: \"DEESMEES\u2013JESHET\u2013BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA\u2013ENITEMOSS\". Not until 1919 did anyone connect this rough writing with anything else in human knowledge. Charles Ward turned pale as he recognized what Mirandola had shudderingly called the worst horror among black magic spells. A clearly human shout. A deep, many-voiced scream seemed to answer this evil wonder from the Curwen farm. Atfer that, unknown smell grew more complex with an added odor equally unbearable. A wailing sound, clearly different from the scream, now burst out. It continued in long, rising and falling waves. At times it seemed almost to form words, though no litsener could identify any definite speech. At one point it seemed to approach the edge of devilish and hysterical laughter.\n###\nA second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy: \u201cAlmighty, protect thy lamb!\u201d Then there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time little Arthur Fenner, Luke\u2019s brother, exclaimed that he saw \u2018a red fog\u2019 going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room. Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations: \u201cDEESMEES\u2013JESHET\u2013BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA\u2013ENITEMOSS\u201d. Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magic\u2019s incantations. An unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter."}

A trip to Dunwich Village did not reveal information. A examination of the Nceronomicon, in the areas Wilbru had searched, appeared to provide. These clues concerned the nature, methods. Desires of the evil threatening the world. Talks consulted with students of knowledge in Boston. He wrote letters to others in places. These actions caused his growing amazement. This feeling changed through levels of alarm. It became a state of fear. As summer approached, he felt something should be done. This concerned the hidden terrors in the Miskatonic valley. It concerned the being known to people as Wilbur Whateley. The Dunwich horror itself occurred between Lammas and equinox in 1928. Dr. Armitage was one of the people who saw its beginning. He had heard about Whateley 's journey to Cambridge. He heard of Whateley 's attempts to borrow. Copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those attempts had failed. Armitage had sent warnings of the kind to all librarians in charge of the feared book. Wilbur had been at Cambridge. He was to get the book. Yet he was to return. He acted as if he feared the cosnequences of being for. in August, the anticipated result happened. In the morning of the 3rd, Dr. Armitage was awakened. The, cries of the watchdog on the college campus woke him. and, the snarling, - growls and barks continued. They grew. But they had pauses. a scream rang out from a throat. This scream woke half the sleepers of Arkham. It haunted their dremas. Such a scream could not come from any being born of earth. of earth. Armitage put on some clothes. He rushed across the street and lawn to the college buildings. He saw that others had arrived before him. He heard the echoes of a burglar - alarm ringing from the library. An window showed and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had finsihed entering. The barking and the screaming were fading. They became a growling and moaning. These sounds came from inside the building. Some instinct warned Armitage that the event happening was not for eyes to see. he pushed the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door.\n###\nA visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley. The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and Dr. Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue. He had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley\u2019s grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long. Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small hours of the 3d Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and terrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always in mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throat\u2014such a scream as roused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterward\u2014such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or wholly of earth. Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library. An open window shewed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door."}

In June, Blake's diary told of his victory over the code. It is foudn the text was in the dark Aklo language. This language was used by certain ancient evil cults. It was known a little from earlier research. The diary says very little about what was decoded. But one sees that Blake was clearly amazed and troulbed by his results. There are mentions of a Haunter of the Dark awakened by looking into the Shining Trapezohedron. There are crazy ideas about the black voids of chaos it came from.

Floated through. valleys, meadows, gardens, cities. Palaces of light. This was in a region without limits and to man. he was no peasant. A creature of importance. He movde and, and was stopped by a enemy. This enemy seemed to be a being of yet structure. It did not appear to be of shape, since Slater referred to it as a man. As anything except a thing. This thing had done Slater some but wrong. The madman longed to get revenge for it. From the way in which Slater talked about their dealings, I judged that he. The thing had met as equals. I judged that in his dream existence man was himself a thing of the kind as his enemy. This impression was supported by his references to flying through space. Burning all that blocked his progress. these ideas wree formed in country words to carry them. This situation drove me to the conclusion that if a dream - world existed, spoken language was not its method for passing of thought. Could it be that the dream - soul living in this body was trying to speak things which the simple. Hatling tongue of dullness could not say? Could it be that I was face to face with flows which would explain the mystery if I could. Learn to find. I did not tell the doctors of these things, for age is,. to accept ideas., the head of the hospital had warned me in his way that I was working. He said my mind needed a rest. It had been my belief that thought consists of atomic. This movement can change into waves of energy like heat, light, and electricity. This belief had led me to think about the possibility of mind reading. communication by means of equipment. In my college days I had prepared a set of sending. Receiving instruments to the devices used in telegraphy at that.\n###\nAnd yet I could extract nothing definite from the man. The sum of all my investigation was, that in a kind of semi-uncorporeal dream life Slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys, meadows, gardens, cities, and palaces of light; in a region unbounded and unknown to man. That there he was no peasant or degenerate, but a creature of importance and vivid life; moving proudly and dominantly, and checked only by a certain deadly enemy, who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure, and who did not appear to be of human shape, since Slater never referred to it as a man, or as aught save a thing. This thing had done Slater some hideous but unnamed wrong, which the maniac (if maniac he were) yearned to avenge. From the manner in which Slater alluded to their dealings, I judged that he and the luminous thing had met on equal terms; that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminous thing of the same race as his enemy. This impression was sustained by his frequent references to flying through space and burning all that impeded his progress. Yet these conceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them, a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a true dream-world indeed existed, oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought. Could it be that the dream-soul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dulness could not utter? Could it be that I was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if I could but learn to discover and read them? I did not tell the older physicians of these things, for middle age is sceptical, cynical, and disinclined to accept new ideas. Besides, the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that I was overworking; that my mind needed a rest. It had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion, convertible into ether waves of radiant energy like heat, light, and electricity. This belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus, and I had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude, pre-radio period."}

Dogs, the absence of Gendey. The six crazily buried biological specimens. These specimens were strangely solid in texture despite their injuries. They came from world dead for forty million years. It is not remembreed if mention was made that when checking the dog bodies, one dog was found missing. This was not thought much about until later. In fact, only Danfroth.

Then I read the forbiddne stories and met the members of old and little-respected cults. That, clearly, gave the material for the dreams. Upset feelings which caem after the return of memory. As for the notes in the margins in dream picture-writings. Languages unknown to me. Put at my door by library workersthe made-up invaders thought to push out men's minds. They then started on searches for knowledge whihc they thought they could take back to an imagined, non-human past. Tehn when their memory returned, they reversed the linking process. Thought of themselves as the former caught minds instead of as the pushers. Hence the dreams and false memories following the usual story pattern. Despite the seeming clumsiness of these explanations, they came finally to replace all others in my mind. This was largely because of the greater weakness of any other theory. good number of well-known psychologists and anthropologists slowly agreed with me. The more I thought, the more convincing my reasoning seemed. In the end I had a truly strong wall against the visions. Feelings which still attacked me. Suppose I did see strange things at night? These were only what I had heard and read about. Suppose I did have odd disgusts and views and false memories? These, too, were only echoes of stories taken in during my other state. Nothing that I might dream, nothing that I might feel, could be of any real meaning. Fortified by this way of thinking, I got much better in nerve balance, even though the visions steadily became more frequent.\n###\nAny chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the amnesia\u2014and then I read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient and ill-regarded cults. That, plainly, supplied the material for the dreams and disturbed feelings which came after the return of memory. As for the marginal notes in dream-hieroglyphs and languages unknown to me, but laid at my door by librarians\u2014I might easily have picked up a smattering of the tongues during my secondary state, while the hieroglyphs were doubtless coined by my fancy from descriptions in old legends, and afterward woven into my dreams. I tried to verify certain points through conversation with known cult-leaders, but never succeeded in establishing the right connexions. At times the parallelism of so many cases in so many distant ages continued to worry me as it had at first, but on the other hand I reflected that the excitant folklore was undoubtedly more universal in the past than in the present. Probably all the other victims whose cases were like mine had had a long and familiar knowledge of the tales I had learned only when in my secondary state. When these victims had lost their memory, they had associated themselves with the creatures of their household myths\u2014the fabulous invaders supposed to displace men\u2019s minds\u2014and had thus embarked upon quests for knowledge which they thought they could take back to a fancied, non-human past. Then when their memory returned, they reversed the associative process and thought of themselves as the former captive minds instead of as the displacers. Hence the dreams and pseudo-memories following the conventional myth-pattern. Despite the seeming cumbrousness of these explanations, they came finally to supersede all others in my mind\u2014largely because of the greater weakness of any rival theory. And a substantial number of eminent psychologists and anthropologists gradually agreed with me. The more I reflected, the more convincing did my reasoning seem; till in the end I had a really effective bulwark against the visions and impressions which still assailed me. Suppose I did see strange things at night? These were only what I had heard and read of. Suppose I did have odd loathings and perspectives and pseudo-memories? These, too, were only echoes of myths absorbed in my secondary state. Nothing that I might dream, nothing that I might feel, could be of any actual significance. Fortified by this philosophy, I greatly improved in nervous equilibrium, even though the visions (rather than the abstract impressions) steadily became more frequent and more disturbingly detailed."}

Thier geologic setting showed they lived at a very early time in the lnad [THING] 's history. Based on their location, they were surely at least thirty million years old. We thought that in their day, the sea - cavern [THING]. The cavern itself, did not exist. They would recall an older view. Lush Tertiary plants were everywhere. A younger land [THING] with thriving arts was around them. A great [THING] flowed north along the mighty mountains toward a far - off tropical [THING]. Still, we could not stop thikning about these specimens. We thought especially about the eight perfect ones missing from Lake 's badly destroyed camp.\n###\nBy this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognised, for the sculptures shewed many signs of the cold\u2019s malign encroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer. The saurian livestock were nearly all dead, and the mammals were standing it none too well. To keep on with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously cold-resistant shoggoths to land life; a thing the Old Ones had formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless, and the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales. All the birds had flown away, save only the great, grotesque penguins. What had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new sea-cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in eternal blackness? Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what fate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered? Had any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice-cap? Existing geology shews no trace of their presence. Had the frightful Mi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? Could one be sure of what might or might not linger even to this day in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth\u2019s deepest waters? Those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure\u2014and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at times. And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by Borchgrevingk? The specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for their geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land city\u2019s history. They were, according to their location, certainly not less than thirty million years old; and we reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself, had no existence. They would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary vegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around them, and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a far-away tropic ocean. And yet we could not help thinking about these specimens\u2014especially about the eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake\u2019s hideously ravaged camp."}

The old sandwich's carefully put together layers were still piling up. I saw my friend jump as if from a sign of a terrible mistake. Unmistakably he was looking at the pantry door and litsening with worry. Then I partly imagined I noticed an absence myself. However, it was not a terrible absence.

It was in some storage place beyond the high shelf I had never been able to see over. The effect on my friend was deep. He dropped his lettuce suddenly. He stood up. He grabbed his knife.

The experts agreed that dreams were the base of the trouble. These were dreams whose clearness could for a time control the waking mind of this man. With formality Slater was tried for murder. He was found not on the ground of insanity. He was sent to the hospital where I held such a position. I have said that I am a thinker about dream life. From this you may judge the eagerness with which I applied myself to the study of the patient as I had learned the facts of his case. He seemed to feel a friendliness in me. This was born no doubt of the interest I could not hide. The way in which I questioned him. Not that he recognized me during his attacks, when I hung on his. word pictures. But he knew me in his hours. he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow. He might be longing for the mountain freedom he could enjoy. His family came to see him. it had found another head, after the manner of decaying mountain folk. By degrees I began to feel an wonder at the. ideas of Joe Slater. The man himself was in mind and language. His, visions, though described in a. Broken speech, were things which a. brain could think of. How, I asked myself, could the imagination of a Catskill declining person create sights whose possession suggested a spark of genius? How could any backwoods thinker have gained an idea of those shining worlds of brightness. Space about which Slater ranted in his madness? I leaned to the belief that in the person who bent before me lay the disordered center of something beyond my understanding. It was something beyond the understanding of my. imagining. And I could get nothing from the man. The total of all my investigation was, that in a kind of - bodiless dream life Slater walked. Floated through. valleys, meadows, gardens, cities.

I have said that I am a constant speculator concerning dream life, and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which I applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as I had fully ascertained the facts of his case. He seemed to sense a certain friendliness in me; born no doubt of the interest I could not conceal, and the gentle manner in which I questioned him. Not that he ever recognised me during his attacks, when I hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but cosmic word-pictures; but he knew me in his quiet hours, when he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow, and perhaps pining for the mountain freedom he could never enjoy again. His family never called to see him; probably it had found another temporary head, after the manner of decadent mountain folk. By degrees I commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic conceptions of Joe Slater. The man himself was pitiably inferior in mentality and language alike; but his glowing, titanic visions, though described in a barbarous and disjointed jargon, were assuredly things which only a superior or even exceptional brain could conceive. How, I often asked myself, could the stolid imagination of a Catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius? How could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which Slater ranted in his furious delirium? More and more I inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension; something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experienced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleagues. And yet I could extract nothing definite from the man. The sum of all my investigation was, that in a kind of semi-uncorporeal dream life Slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys, meadows, gardens, cities, and palaces of light; in a region unbounded and unknown to man."}

Built his house, he thought the many storms were just a strange part of that year. But later he saw the area was very prone to such events. Fianlly, these storms hurt his health. He prepared a cellar to hide in during the worst weather. Less is known about Of Gerrit Martense's children than about him. They were all raised to hate English civilization and to avoid colonists who accepted it. Their life was very isolated. People said their seclusion made them slow to speak and understand. In looks, all had a strange inherited trait: their eyes were different colors, one usually blue. The other brown. Their social contacts became fewer. Eventually, they married the many servants around the property. Many family members declined, moevd across the valley. Mixed with the poor mixed-race people who later became the pitiful squatters. The others stayed stubbornly at their family home, becoming more closed-off. Growing nervous reaction to the frequent thunderstorms. Most of this news reached the outside through young Jan Martense. He felt restless and joined the colonial army when word of the Albany Convention reached Tempest Mountain. He was the first of Gerrit's line to see much of the world. When he came back in 1760 after six years at war, his father, uncles. Brothers hated him as a stranger, despite his different Martense eyes. He could no longer share the special ways and biases of the Martenses. Even the mountain thunderstorms no excited him as before. Instead, his surroundings made him sad. He often wrote to friend in Albany about plans to leave his father's house. In spring 1763, Jonathan Gifford, the Albany friend of Jan Martense, grew worried by his silence, especially given the troubles. Fights at the Martense mansion. Determined decided to visit Jan himself. He rode into the mountains. His diray says he reached Tempest Mountain on September 20, finding the house very run-down. The gloomy, odd-eyed Martenses, whose dirty animal look shocked him, told him in rough, broken speech that Jan was dead.\n###\nWhen selecting the hill and building his mansion, Mynheer Martense had laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year; but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to such phenomena. At length, having found these storms injurious to his health, he fitted up a cellar into which he could retreat from their wildest pandemonium. Of Gerrit Martense\u2019s descendants less is known than of himself; since they were all reared in hatred of the English civilisation, and trained to shun such of the colonists as accepted it. Their life was exceedingly secluded, and people declared that their isolation had made them heavy of speech and comprehension. In appearance all were marked by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes; one generally being blue and the other brown. Their social contacts grew fewer and fewer, till at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class about the estate. Many of the crowded family degenerated, moved across the valley, and merged with the mongrel population which was later to produce the pitiful squatters. The rest had stuck sullenly to their ancestral mansion, becoming more and more clannish and taciturn, yet developing a nervous responsiveness to the frequent thunderstorms. Most of this information reached the outside world through young Jan Martense, who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army when news of the Albany Convention reached Tempest Mountain. He was the first of Gerrit\u2019s descendants to see much of the world; and when he returned in 1760 after six years of campaigning, he was hated as an outsider by his father, uncles, and brothers, in spite of his dissimilar Martense eyes. No longer could he share the peculiarities and prejudices of the Martenses, while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had before. Instead, his surroundings depressed him; and he frequently wrote to a friend in Albany of plans to leave the paternal roof. In the spring of 1763 Jonathan Gifford, the Albany friend of Jan Martense, became worried by his correspondent\u2019s silence; especially in view of the conditions and quarrels at the Martense mansion. Determined to visit Jan in person, he went into the mountains on horseback. His diary states that he reached Tempest Mountain on September 20, finding the mansion in great decrepitude. The sullen, odd-eyed Martenses, whose unclean animal aspect shocked him, told him in broken gutturals that Jan was dead."}

The feast for the thousandth year of the destruction of Ib was extremely grand. People in the land of Mnar had talked about it for ten years. As the time came near, men from Thraa, Ilarnek. From all the cities of Mnar. The lands beyond, came to Sarnath on horses, camesl. On the chosen night, the pavilions of princes. The tents of travelers were set up before the marble walls. The whole shore echoed with the songs of happy people celebrating. Inside the banquet hall, King Nargis-Hei lay down. He was drunk on old wine from the cellars of conquered Pnath. He was surrounded by nobles who were feasting and slaves who were hurrying about. It is noted that many unusual foods weer eaten at that feast. These included peacocks from the islands of Nariel in the Middle Ocean, young goats from the faraway hills of Implan, camel heels from the Bnazic desert, nuts. Spices from Cydathrian groves. Pearls from wave-washed Mtal dissolved in vinegar from Thraa. There were too many sauces to count. The most skilled cooks in all Mnar prepared them to suit every eater's taset. But the most valued dishes were large fish from the lake. Each fish was very big. They were served on golden platters decorated with rubies and diamonds.\n###\nGorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of Ib.

Armitage heard the heavy creaking of the wicker basket. He examined its stretched, swollen shape as it sat on the linoleum floor visible from the doorway.

Twice I saw people who looked tired working in gardens. Digging clams on the fishy-smelling beach below. Groups of dirty children with faces like monkeys played near doorsteps covered in weeds. These people seemed moer troubling than the sad buildings. Almost every one had faces. Ways of moving that I did not like, though I could not say why. For a moment, I thought their common look reminded me of a picture I had seen, maybe in a book, under very scary. But this false memory went away quickly. As the bus went lower, I started to hear the constant sound of a waterfall through the unusual The leaning, unpainted houses became more numerous. They lined both sides of the road. Looked more like a town than the ones we left behind. The view ahead narrowed to a street scene. In some places, I could see where a stone road. Brick sidewalk had once been. All the houses seemed There were occasional spaces where fallen chimneys and cellar walls showed buildings had collapsed. There was the worst fishy smell you could imagine. Side streets and crossings began to appear. Those on the left led to dirty, unpaved areas near the shore that were falling apart. Those on the right showed views of past greatness. Far, I had seen no people in the town. Now there were signs of a few living therewood. Brick buildings from the early 1800s\u2014they were clearly kept in condition for living. As someone who likes things, I almost forgot the smell. My feelings of threat. Disgust among this well-preserved piece of the past. But I was not to reach my goal without one very strong and unpleasant impression. The bus arrived at a kind of open square. Central point with churches on two sides. The messy remains of a round green area in the middle. I was looking at a hall with pillars at the crossing ahead on the right. The building's once-white paint was now gray and coming off. Gold sign on the front was. Faded I could barely read the words \"Esotreic Order of Dagon\".\n###\nOnce or twice I saw listless-looking people working in barren gardens or digging clams on the fishy-smelling beach below, and groups of dirty, simian-visaged children playing around weed-grown doorsteps. Somehow these people seemed more disquieting than the dismal buildings, for almost every one had certain peculiarities of face and motions which I instinctively disliked without being able to define or comprehend them. For a second I thought this typical physique suggested some picture I had seen, perhaps in a book, under circumstances of particular horror or melancholy; but this pseudo-recollection passed very quickly. As the bus reached a lower level I began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness. The leaning, unpainted houses grew thicker, lined both sides of the road, and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind. The panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene, and in spots I could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed. All the houses were apparently deserted, and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed. Pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odour imaginable. Soon cross streets and junctions began to appear; those on the left leading to shoreward realms of unpaved squalor and decay, while those on the right shewed vistas of departed grandeur. So far I had seen no people in the town, but there now came signs of a sparse habitation\u2014curtained windows here and there, and an occasional battered motor-car at the curb. Pavement and sidewalks were increasingly well defined, and though most of the houses were quite old\u2014wood and brick structures of the early nineteenth century\u2014they were obviously kept fit for habitation. As an amateur antiquarian I almost lost my olfactory disgust and my feeling of menace and repulsion amidst this rich, unaltered survival from the past. But I was not to reach my destination without one very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality. The bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the centre, and I was looking at a large pillared hall on the right-hand junction ahead. The structure\u2019s once white paint was now grey and peeling, and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that I could only with difficulty make out the words \u201cEsoteric Order of Dagon\u201d."}

It thrummed with unseen currents. Wries and coils vibrated. It hummed from the city power grids. It was heavy with the cold of man-made frost. Mechanical oceans flowed there, powered by generators the ear can hardly hear. Their waves had strange harmonies and echoes of ufnathomed deep places. Monotonous endlessness pulsed around the listener. It carried him away without even moving the body that slumped stiffly from the old floor. For hours not shown on human clocks, the tides of hidden circuits carried him softly. They carried him to join the gentle songs he wanted without knowing it. Wakefulness had sent those songs away. Over many cycles they gently left him sleepy befoer a pale fluorescent dawn. It was a pale dawn that smelled of ozone. Was marked by the red numbers of a digital clock.\n###\nThere came to that kitchen a low drone of electric midnight thrumming with currents unseen; vibrations of wire and coil, humming from the municipal grids and heavy with the chill of artificial frosts. Mechanical oceans poured there, powered by dynamos that the ear may scarcely discern and having in their oscillations strange harmonics and resonances of unplumbed depths. Monotonous infinity pulsed around the listener and bore him away without even stirring the form that slouched stiffly from the worn linoleum; and for hours not marked on mortal clocks the tides of hidden circuits bore him gently to join the lullabies for which he subconsciously yearned; the lullabies that wakefulness has banished. And in the course of many cycles they tenderly left him drowsing before a pale fluorescent dawn; a pale dawn fragrant with ozone and starred by the red numerals of a digital chronometer."}

Less than a week after they returned to England, things started to happen. They lived like hermits. They had no friends and no servants. They stayed in a few rooms of an manor house on a lonely moor. Visitors rarely knocked on their doors. However, tehy were now bothered by frequent sounds of fumbling at night. This happened around the doors and windows, both upstairs and downstairs. Once they imagined a shape blocked the library window when the moon shone on it. Another time, they thought they heard a whirring or flapping sound nearby. Each time they checked, they found nothing. They started to think these events were just their imagination. Their imagination was already troubled. It made them still hear the faint, distant howling they thought they heard in the Holland churchyard. The jade amulet was now placed in a niche in their museum. Sometimes thye burned strangely scented candles in front of it. They read a lot in Alhazred's Necronomicon about its properties. They read about how ghouls' souls relate to the things it symbolizes. What they read disturbed tehm. Then terror arrived.\n###\nLess than a week after our return to England, strange things began to happen. We lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor-house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor. Now, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be frequent fumblings in the night, not only around the doors but around the windows also, upper as well as lower. Once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off. On each occasion investigation revealed nothing, and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination alone\u2014that same curiously disturbed imagination which still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the Holland churchyard. The jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum, and sometimes we burned strangely scented candles before it. We read much in Alhazred\u2019s Necronomicon about its properties, and about the relation of ghouls\u2019 souls to the objects it symbolised; and were disturbed by what we read. Then terror came."}

He recognized them FROM the brief look Charles had allowed him many years before. The young man had clearly ketp them together just as they were when he first fonud them. All the titles the workmen remembered were three. Only the papers sent to Orne. The code with itts key, were missing. Willett put the whole set in his bag and keept looking through the files. Since young Ward's current state was the most urgent concern, the search focused on the most recent material. in this large amount of modern writing, one very confusing oddity was seen. The oddity was the small amount in Charles's normal handwriting. In fact, nothing in his normal hand was newer than two months old. On the other hand, there were huge amounst of symbols. Formulas, historical nootes. These were in a cramped handwriting that was exactly the same as the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though clearly written recently. Plainly, part of the recent plan had been a careful copying of the old wizard's writing. Charles seemed to have achieved a remarkable level of skill in this. There was no sign of any third hand that migght have been Aleln's. If Allen had really become the leader, he must have forced young Ward to write for him.\n###\nAt last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Ward\u2019s immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charles\u2019s normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard\u2019s writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allen\u2019s there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis."}

Some of these masses seemed to be alive. Others seemed not alive. A few of the living objects tended to stir vague memories in the back of the chronicler's mind. The chronicler could not consciously think of what they mockingly looked like. In the later dreams, the chronicler started to see separate groups. The living objects appeared to be divided into these groups. Each group seemed to involve a completely different kind of behavior pattern. Basic reason for acting.

Seeing the folw of them in the weak, flashing lightning was shocking. When they became fewer. Could be seen as separate creatures, it was seen thye weer small, misshapen, hairy devils.

They had warned him he wuold find the feared and unvisited quarry there. Hands older than men's hands had pulled huge blocks from that place. He did not like it when, turning back to wave a last farewell, he thought he saw approaching the camp that short. Evaisve old merchant with slanting eyes. His suspected trading with Leng was the gossip of distant Dylath-Leen. After two more quarries, the lived-in part of Inganok seemed to end. The road nrarowed to a steeply rising yak-path among forbidding black cliffs. Always on the right towered the bare and distant peaks. As Carter climbed farther. Farther into this untraveled realm, he found it grew draker. Soon he saw that there were no prints of feet. Hooves on the black path beneath. He realized that he had indeed coem into strange and deserted ways of elder time. Once in a while a raven would croak far overhead. Then a flapping behind some vast rock would maek him think uncomfortably of the rumored shantak-bird. But mainly he was alone with his hairy animal. It troubled him to see that this excellent yak became more. More unwilling to go forward. It became more. More likely to snort in fear at any small noise along the route. The path now became tight between black and shiny walls. It began to show an even greater steepness.\n###\nIn the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north, where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than men\u2019s hands had wrenched prodigious blocks. But he did not like it when, turning back to wave a last farewell, he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes, whose conjectured traffick with Leng was the gossip of distant Dylath-Leen. After two more quarries the inhabited part of Inganok seemed to end, and the road narrowed to a steeply rising yak-path among forbidding black cliffs. Always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks, and as Carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it grew darker and colder. Soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath, and realised that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time. Once in a while a raven would croak far overhead, and now and then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured shantak-bird. But in the main he was alone with his shaggy steed, and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak become more and more reluctant to advance, and more and more disposed to snort affrightedly at any small noise along the route. The path now contracted between sable and glistening walls, and began to display an even greater steepness than before. It was a bad footing, and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strown thickly about. In two hours Carter saw ahead a definite crest, beyond which was nothing but dull grey sky, and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course. To reach this crest, however, was no easy task; for the way had grown nearly perpendicular, and was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones. Eventually Carter dismounted and led his dubious yak; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled, and keeping his own footing as best he might. Then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond, and gasped at what he saw. The path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down, with the same lines of high natural walls as before; but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous space, vast acres in extent, where some archaic power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giants\u2019 quarry."}

This widespread, longl-asting boredom had certainly been caused by the terrible magazines that spread across the dirty. These magazines had once provided a small distraction for the waiting patients. Later, they showed their very old and shocking publication dates. Little gradually, they woer down the weak mental health of those forced to wait. Finally, their annoying repetitions reached deep into the mind. They combined with the still air to create a stronger feeling of hopelessness. Finally their entire material broke into dry yellow page.s This made the old promises of entertainment completely empty. Much of the suffering we now experienced was based on that empty starting point. The caretakers saw what had happened. They performed their rarely used duty to improve the environment. They should get newer and less awful books to put on those huge shelves. This is where the tired eyes start to look down into a feeling of bored fear.\n###\nThis vast, time-worn ennui had undoubtedly been bred by the dreadful periodicals which proliferated upon the unwholesome and tattered tables, and which had formerly offered some meagre distraction to the waiting sufferers before turning at last to reveal their ancient and unspeakable dates. Little by little they had eroded the fragile sanity of those condemned to linger, till at last their maddening repetitions reached the caverns of the mind and joined with the stagnant air in conjuring a deeper despair. Finally their whole substance decayed into brittle yellow leaves and left the old promises of diversion utterly void. Much of the subsequent torment as we now endured it had been built upon that barren foundation. The custodians, perceiving what had transpired, and exercising their seldom-awakened aesthetic duty, should procure more recent and less abhorrent volumes to place upon those cyclopean racks where the weary gaze begins its descent into listless dread."}

No steam was visible like at the entrance. This was because there was no cooler air to contrast. The temperature rose quickly. They found a messy pile of familiar items. It was not a surprise. The pile had furs and tent cloth from Lake's camp. They did not stop to look at the cuts in the fabric. Slightly Past this point, the side galleries were larger and more numerous. They decided they had reached the area under the higher hills of honeycomb spaces. The unknown smell now mixed with another, almost as smell. They could not tell what it was. They thought of rotting things or maybe unknown underground fungi. Then the tunnel suddenly widened. The carvings had not suggested this. It became a tall, natural-looking oval cave with a flat floor. It was about 75 feet and 50 feet Many side passages led into mystery.\n###\nAfter about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated, and we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed. There was no visible vapour as at the mouth, but this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air. The temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was composed of furs and tent-cloth taken from Lake\u2019s camp, and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed. Slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the side-galleries, and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been reached. The nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odour\u2014of what nature we could not guess, though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrene fungi. Then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us\u2014a broadening and rising into a lofty, natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor; some 75 feet long and 50 broad, and with many immense side-passages leading away into cryptical darkness."}

The ground where he lay had grass growing through it. Bushes and roots had cracked the ground apart. A tall black cliff stood near him. It went straight up and seemed to have no top. Its dark side had scary carvings on it. There was a carved archway that led into the darkness he had come from. In front of him stretched two lines of pillars. There were also broken pieces and bases of pillars. This showed there had once been a wide street here. From the pots. Bowls along the path, he knew it had been a great street with gardens. Far away at the end, the pillars spread out to form a large round open space. In that open circle, under the red night clouds, stood two huge and monstrous shapes. They were winged lions made of dark stone. There was blackness and shadow between them. Their strange and complete heads rose twenty feet high. They snarled scornfully at the ruins around them. He knew exactly what they must be. Stories tell of only one such pair. They were the eternal guards of the gaet. These dark ruins were truly the ancient city. His first action was to close and block the archway in the cliff. He used fallen stones and odd bits of rubble that were lying around. He did not want anyone to follow him from the hateful temple on the plateau. The path ahead would have enough other dangers. He knew nothing about how to get from this city to the inhabited parts of the dreamlands. Giong down to the caves of the ghouls would not help much. He knew they were no better informed than he was. The three ghouls that helped him through the city of the giants to the outside world did not know how to reach their own city on the way back. They had planned to ask old traders in the city of the ghouls. He did not like the idea of going back to the underground world of the giants. He did not want to risk that terrible tower with its countelss steps leading to the magic forest again. But he felt he might have to try this if nothing else worked. He did not dare to cross the high plain past the lonely temple without help. The high priest's messengers would be many. At the end of the journey, there would surely be the flying creatures. Maybe other things to face.\n###\nAll around were crumbling walls and broken columns, and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots. Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come. Ahead stretched double rows of pillars, and the fragments and pedestals of pillars, that spoke of a broad and bygone street; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens. Far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza, and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things. Huge winged lions of diorite they were, with blackness and shadow between them. Full twenty feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads, and snarled derisive on the ruins around them. And Carter knew right well what they must be, for legend tells of only one such twain. They were the changeless guardians of the Great Abyss, and these dark ruins were in truth primordial Sarkomand. Carter\u2019s first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around. He wished no follower from Leng\u2019s hateful monastery, for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers. Of how to get from Sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all; nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls, since he knew they were no better informed than he. The three ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach Sarkomand in their journey back, but had planned to ask old traders in Dylath-Leen. He did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of Koth with its Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood, yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed. Over Leng\u2019s plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided; for the high-priest\u2019s emissaries must be many, while at the journey\u2019s end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with."}

He yelled about what he discovered. The othesr went after him. They examined the huge carved door with the now recognizable squid-dragon carving with curiosity. Johanseen stated it resembled a giant barn door. They all believed it was a door because of the decorated beam above, the sill below. The side posts around it. They could not determine if it was flat like a hatch. Slanted like external cellar door. As As Wilcox wuold have noted, the geometry of the spot was completely incorrect.

It had been stopped when dreams first failed. But here too, there was no satisfaction or fulfillment. The influence of the ordinary world was on the mind. Lovely things could not be thought of as had been done in the past. Ironic humor was seen to pull down all the dreamlike towers that were built. The practical fear of things being unlikely destroyed all the delicate. Amazing flowers in the fairy gardens. The custom of pretending to feel pity was seen to make the characters overly sentimental. The false idea of an important reality. Significant human events. Emotions lowered all the fantasy. It became thinly disguised allegory and cheap social satire. The novels were successful in a way the ones never were. It was known how they must be to please an public. So they were burned and the writing stopped. They were very elegant novels. In them, a polite laugh was aimed at the dreams that were lightly desrcibed. But it becomes clear that their over-refinement had remvoed all their life.\n###\nThen he began once more the writing of books, which he had left off when dreams first failed him. But here, too, was there no satisfaction or fulfilment; for the touch of earth was upon his mind, and he could not think of lovely things as he had done of yore. Ironic humour dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared, and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his faery gardens. The convention of assumed pity spilt mawkishness on his characters, while the myth of an important reality and significant human events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thin-veiled allegory and cheap social satire. His new novels were successful as his old ones had never been; and because he knew how empty they must be to please an empty herd, he burned them and ceased his writing. They were very graceful novels, in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he lightly sketched; but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all their life away."}

We doubted whether that strong smell the dogs hated could cause equal dislike in these penguins. Their ancestors had clearly lived very well with the Old Ones. This friendly relationship must have lasted in the abyss below as long as any Elderly Ones remained. We felt regret, in a return of the old pure science spirit, that we could not photograph these odd creatures. We soon left them to their squawking. We pushed on toward the abyss. Its openness was now so clearly proven to us. Occasional penguin tracks showed its exact direction. Not long after, a steep drop in a long, low, doorless. Strangely carving - less hall made us think we were nearing the tunnel mouth at last. We passed two more penguins. We heard others right ahead. Then the hall ended in a huge open space. It made us gasp without thinking. It was a perfect upside - down bowl shape, clearly deep underground. It was fully a hundred feet across and fifty feet high. Low archways opened around all parts of the edge except one. That one opened like a huge cave with a black arched opening. It broke the curve of the roof to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was the entrance to the great abyss. In this huge bowl, whose curved roof was carved to look like ancient [THING] dome, a few white penguins waddled. They were outsiders there, but they did not care and did not see. The black tunnel opened steeply downward without clear end. Its opening was decorated with oddly carved side posts and top beam. From that mysterious mouth we imagined a slightly warmer air current came. Maybe even a hint of steam came out. We wondered what living things, besides penguins, the endless space below might hide. Also, the connected honeycomb areas of the land and giant mountains might hide things. We also wondered if the trace of [THING] - top smoke first suspected by poor Lake was caused by this. Also, the odd haze we saw around the [THING] - topped peak might be caused by it. It might be from twisting channels rising from unexplored regions of [THING] 's core. Entering the tunnel, we saw its size was, at least at the start, about fifteen feet in each direction. The sides, [THING], and arched roof were made of the usual giant stonework. The sides had few decorations. They were standard designs in a late, declining style. All the [THING] and carving were amazingly well preserved.\n###\nWe doubted whether that pungent odour which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins; since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms with the Old Ones\u2014an amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained. Regretting\u2014in a flareup of the old spirit of pure science\u2014that we could not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clear. Not long afterward a steep descent in a long, low, doorless, and peculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnel-mouth at last. We had passed two more penguins, and heard others immediately ahead. Then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us gasp involuntarily\u2014a perfect inverted hemisphere, obviously deep underground; fully an hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high, with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one, and that one yawning cavernously with a black arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet. It was the entrance to the great abyss. In this vast hemisphere, whose concave roof was impressively though decadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome, a few albino penguins waddled\u2014aliens there, but indifferent and unseeing. The black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep descending grade, its aperture adorned with grotesquely chiselled jambs and lintel. From that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air and perhaps even a suspicion of vapour proceeded; and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void below, and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains, might conceal. We wondered, too, whether the trace of mountain-top smoke at first suspected by poor Lake, as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the rampart-crowned peak, might not be caused by the tortuous-channelled rising of some such vapour from the unfathomed regions of earth\u2019s core. Entering the tunnel, we saw that its outline was\u2014at least at the start\u2014about fifteen feet each way; sides, floor, and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry. The sides were sparsely decorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a late, decadent style; and all the construction and carving were marvellously well preserved."}

It is unfortunate that most people have too narrow a view of home life. They cannot patiently and intelligently consider those separate efficient methods. These methods are noticed and used only by a few very organized people. They exist outside common ktichen experience. Men with wider understanding know there is no clear line between messy and organized. Flavorings seem as they do only because of the specific space. Thought processes that make us aware of them. The plain disorder of most people calls it crazy when moments of super-organization berak through the usual veil of obvious kitchen confusion.\n###\nIn relating the circumstances which have led to my advocacy for this system of culinary order, I am aware that my present zeal will create a natural doubt of the validity of my proposition. It is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too limited in its domestic vision to weigh with patience and intelligence those isolated efficiencies, perceived and utilized only by a methodically sensitive few, which lie outside its common kitchen experience. Men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the chaotic and the ordered; that all condiments appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual spatial and cognitive media through which we are made conscious of them; but the prosaic disarray of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of super-organization which penetrate the common veil of obvious culinary confusion."}

It was impossible to guess how large an area they had opened up without trying. The different buildings were closely and often connected. This made it likely they could cross from one to another on bridges under the ice. This would be excpet where blocked by local collapses and earth cracks. Very little ice seemed to have gotten into the big structures. Almost All the clear ice areas showed the underwater windows were tightly closed. It was as if the town had been left in that same state until the ice sheet came to freeze the lower part for all future time. Indeed, they got a strange feeling that this place had been purposely shut. Left empty in some distant, past age. It was not destroyed by any sudden disaster or even slow ruin. Had Had the coming of the ice been expected? Had an unknown people all left together to find a less doomed home? The exact land conditions when the ice sheet formed here would have to be solved later. It had very clearly not been a crushing movement. Maybe the weight of piled-up snow was the cause. Maybe some flood from the river. From an ancient ice dam breaking in the great mountain range, helped create the special state seen now. Imagination could imagine almost anything about this place.\n###\nJust how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible to guess without a trial. The close and frequent connexion of the different buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts, for very little glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions. Almost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered, as if the town had been left in that uniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallise the lower part for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a curious impression that this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim, bygone aeon, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even gradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a nameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode? The precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the ice-sheet at this point would have to wait for later solution. It had not, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps the pressure of accumulated snows had been responsible; and perhaps some flood from the river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the great range, had helped to create the special state now observable. Imagination could conceive almost anything in connexion with this place."}

That was the end of their voluntary searches in dream caves. Serious, the chronicler's friend who had been beyond the barrier warned the chronicler they must never go into those places again. What he saw, he did not dare tell the chronicler. From his wisdom, he said they must sleep as little as possible, even if drugs were needed to stay awake. The chronicler soon learned he was right from the terrible fear that filled the chronicler whenever consciousness lapsed. After each short and unavoidable sleep, the chronicler seemed older. The chronicler's friend aged very quickly, which was almost shocking. It is awful to see wrinkles form and hair turn white almost before your eyes. Theri way of life was now completely changed. Heretofore a recluse as far as the chronicler knewthe chronicler's friend now became frantic in his fear of being alone. At night he would not be by himself. The company of a few people would not calm him either. His only relief came from loud and wild parties. So they went to almost all gatherings of young and lively people. Their appearance and age seemed to cause ridicule in most cases. The chronicler strongly disliked this. The chronicler's friend thought it was a smaller problem than being alone. Especially was he afraid to be outside alone when the stars were out. If forced into this situation, he would often look secretly at the sky as if chased by some monster there. He did not always loko at the same place in the sky. It seemed to be a different place at different times. On spring evenings, it would be low in the northeast. In summer, it would be almost overhead. In autumn, it would be in the northwest. In winter, it would be in the east, mostly in the early morning hours. Midwinter evenings seemed least scary to him. Only after two years did the chronicler link this fear to anything specific. Then the chronicler began to see he must be looking at a special spot in the sky. Its position at different times matched the direction of his look. This spot was ruoghly marked by constellation Corona Borealis.\n###\nThat was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream.

But he could smell an overpowering stink. He could hear a mix of, sounds above him. Whenever he moved he tripped over something. At each noise there would come a sort of answering sound from. It was a moving soun,d mixed with the sliding of wood on wood. Once his feeling hands met a pillar of stone with an top. he found himself holding the rungs of a ladder built into the wall. He felt his way. He went toward smoe area of smell where a, burning blast beat down against him. Before his eyes, a changing ragne of images played. All of them dissolved at times into the picture of a, hole of night. In it whirled suns and wordls of an blackness. He thought of the stories of Ultimate Chaos. At its center lies the idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things. He is surrounded by his flopping crowd of and dancers. He is calmed by the, repeating sound of a fulte held in nameless paws. a noise from the world broke through his daze. It woke him to the horror of his situation. What it was, he knew. it was some sound from fireworks. Fireworks were heard all summer on Federal Hill as the people celebrate their patrno saints. The saints of their home villaegs in Italy. In any case, he screamed. He dropped from the ladder. He stumbled across the floor of the lightless room that surrounded him. He knew where he was. He rushed down the staircase. He tripped and hurt himself at every turn. There was a nightmare run through a, cobwebbed church area. Its arches reached up to areas of mocking shadow. There was a struggle through a basement. There was a climb to areas of air and street - lights. There was a race down a hill of chattering house fronts. He went across a, city of towers. He went up the cliff to his door. When he woke up in the morning, he found himself lying on his study floor. He was dressed.\n###\nAfter retiring on the night of the 30th he had suddenly found himself groping about in an almost black space. All he could see were short, faint, horizontal streaks of bluish light, but he could smell an overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft, furtive sounds above him. Whenever he moved he stumbled over something, and at each noise there would come a sort of answering sound from above\u2014a vague stirring, mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood. Once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top, whilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall, and fumbling his uncertain way upward toward some region of intenser stench where a hot, searing blast beat down against him. Before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played, all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast, unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness. He thought of the ancient legends of Ultimate Chaos, at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god Azathoth, Lord of All Things, encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers, and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a daemoniac flute held in nameless paws. Then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused him to the unutterable horror of his position. What it was, he never knew\u2014perhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard all summer on Federal Hill as the dwellers hail their various patron saints, or the saints of their native villages in Italy. In any event he shrieked aloud, dropped frantically from the ladder, and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber that encompassed him. He knew instantly where he was, and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiral staircase, tripping and bruising himself at every turn. There was a nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches reached up to realms of leering shadow, a sightless scramble through a littered basement, a climb to regions of air and street-lights outside, and a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering gables, across a grim, silent city of tall black towers, and up the steep eastward precipice to his own ancient door. On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study floor fully dressed."}

The house, as I said, had a smell. But the smell in his room was. This was despite all the spices. The chemicals from the baths. He insisted on taking these baths. I saw the smell must be linked to his sickness. I shuddered when I thought about what that sickness might be. Mrs. Herrero crossed herself when she looked at him. She gave him up to me. She would not let her son Esteban continue to do errands for him. When I suggested doctors, the sufferer would fly into rage as he seemed to allow himself. He feared the effect of emotion. his will and driving force grwe than faded. He refused to stay in bed. The tiredness of his days gave way to a return of his purpose. He seemed to defy the death - demon as that eenmy took hold of him. The prteense of eating, like a formality for him, he gave up. power seemed to keep him from collapse. He got a haibt of writing documents of some sort. He sealed them. He gave orders that I send them after his death to people he named. were educated East Indians. They included a doctor thought. The things had been whispered about him. As it happened, I burned all these papers without delivering or opening them. His appearance and voice became. His presence was. One September day, an sight of him caused an fit in a man. This man had come to fix his desk lamp. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz prescribed for the fit while keeping himself out of sight. That man,, had been through the terrors of Great War without feeling fright., in the middle of October, the horror came with suddenness. One night around eleven, the pump of the cooling machine broke. within three hours, the coloing process became.\n###\nI likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply houses. An increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment. The whole house, as I have said, had a musty odour; but the smell in his room was worse\u2014and in spite of all the spices and incense, and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant baths which he insisted on taking unaided. I perceived that it must be connected with his ailment, and shuddered when I reflected on what that ailment might be. Mrs. Herrero crossed herself when she looked at him, and gave him up unreservedly to me; not even letting her son Esteban continue to run errands for him. When I suggested other physicians, the sufferer would fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain. He evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion, yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned, and he refused to be confined to his bed. The lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place to a return of his fiery purpose, so that he seemed about to hurl defiance at the death-daemon even as that ancient enemy seized him. The pretence of eating, always curiously like a formality with him, he virtually abandoned; and mental power alone appeared to keep him from total collapse. He acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort, which he carefully sealed and filled with injunctions that I transmit them after his death to certain persons whom he named\u2014for the most part lettered East Indians, but including a once celebrated French physician now generally thought dead, and about whom the most inconceivable things had been whispered. As it happened, I burned all these papers undelivered and unopened. His aspect and voice became utterly frightful, and his presence almost unbearable. One September day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight. That man, oddly enough, had been through the terrors of the Great War without having incurred any fright so thorough. Then, in the middle of October, the horror of horrors came with stupefying suddenness. One night about eleven the pump of the refrigerating machine broke down, so that within three hours the process of ammonia cooling became impossible."}

The observer had hoped it would last into the night to help their search. But a thin sunbeam came through a knothole behind them. This made that hope unlikely. Suggesting to Munroe that they should get some light even if more rain came. The observer unlocked and opened the simple door. The ground outside was a strange mix of mud and puddles. There were fresh piles of earth from a small landslide. But the observer saw nothing that explained why their companion was so interested. He was silently leaning out the window.

I can recall the scene now\u2014the desolate, pitch-black garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down; the ticking of the lone clock; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the dressing-table; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space; and worst of all the deep, steady, sinister breathing of my friend on the couch\u2014a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden, unimagined, and hideously remote. The tension of my vigil became oppressive, and a wild train of trivial impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind. I heard a clock strike somewhere\u2014not ours, for that was not a striking clock\u2014and my morbid fancy found in this a new starting-point for idle wanderings. Clocks\u2014time\u2014space\u2014infinity\u2014and then my fancy reverted to the local as I reflected that even now, beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere, Corona Borealis was rising in the northeast. Corona Borealis, which my friend had appeared to dread, and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether. All at once my feverishly sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the soft medley of drug-magnified sounds\u2014a low and damnably insistent whine from very far away; droning, clamouring, mocking, calling, from the northeast. But it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed; not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to break down the door. It was not what I heard, but what I saw; for in that dark, locked, shuttered, and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible red-gold light\u2014a shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness, but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper, bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful memory-face as I had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time, when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret, innermost, and forbidden caverns of nightmare."}

Unease, an attempt was made to live as suited a man of sharp thought. family background. Dreams were fading under the mockery of the times. Nothing could be believed in. The love of harmony kept one near the customs of his people. Human cities were walked through without feeling. Sighs were made because no view seemed completely real. Every flash of yellow sun on tall roofs. Every sight of plazas with railings in the first evening lamps only reminded one of dreams once known. It inspired a longing for airy lands one no longer knew how to find. Travel could only be seen as a fake copy. Even the War moved one very though service was given form the start in the Foreign Legion of France. For a time friends were looked for. Soon tiredness was felt at the roughness of their feelings. Plainness of their views. A slight happiness was felt that all relatives were far away and out of contact. They could not have understood that inner life. That is, only a grandfather. Great-uncle Christopher could have. They had been dead a time.\n###\nAmidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live as befitted a man of keen thought and good heritage. With his dreams fading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything, but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and station. He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed because no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known, and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find. Travel was only a mockery; and even the Great War stirred him but little, though he served from the first in the Foreign Legion of France. For a while he sought friends, but soon grew weary of the crudeness of their emotions, and the sameness and earthiness of their visions. He felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and out of touch with him, for they could not have understood his mental life. That is, none but his grandfather and great-uncle Christopher could, and they were long dead."}

Several visitors saw this room. However, no one was ever allowed into the tightly boarded upper floor. He lined this room with tall, strong shelves. He began to arrange all the rotting books and book parts on them. These items had been piled randomly in corners of various rooms during his own time. He arranged them in what seemed like careful order. \"I made some use of them,\" he would say. He tried to fix a torn page with paste made on the rusty kitchen stove. \"But the boy is fit to make better use of them. He ought to have them set as well as he can. They are going to be all of his learning.\" When Wilbur was one year. Seven months This was in September of 1914. His size and skilsl were almost frightening. He had grown as as a four-year-old child. He was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the fields and hills. He went with his mother on all her walks. At home, he would study the pictures and charts in his grandfather's books diligently. Meanwhile, Whateley would teach and question him through afternoosn. By this time, the house restoration was finished. Those who watched it wondered why one upper window had been changed into a solid plank door. It was a window at the back of the east gable end, very close to the hill. No one could understand why a wooden ruwnay with celats was built up to it from the ground. Around the time this work was completed, people noticed something. The tool-house had been abandoned again. It had been tightly locked and covered with clapboards without windows since Wilbur's birth. The door now swung lazily open. Earl Sawyer once stepped inside after visiting Whateley to sell cattle. He was very disturbed by the smell he met there. He claimed it was a stench he had never smelled before in all his life. He had only smelled something like it near the Indian circles on the hills. It could not come from anything sane or of this earth. Sheds of Dunwich folk have never been known for cleanliness of smell. The next months had no visible events. The only thing was that everyone swore to a slow. Steady increase in the mysterious noises from the hills.\n###\nLess inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson\u2014a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story. This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms. \u201cI made some use of \u2019em,\u201d he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, \u201cbut the boy\u2019s fitten to make better use of \u2019em. He\u2019d orter hev \u2019em as well sot as he kin, for they\u2019re goin\u2019 to be all of his larnin\u2019.\u201d When Wilbur was a year and seven months old\u2014in September of 1914\u2014his size and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather\u2019s books, while Old Whateley would instruct and catechise him through long, hushed afternoons. By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this work\u2019s completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur\u2019s birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered\u2014such a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness. The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises."}

This was though investigators found no evidence. They visited the building after some tale from the suqatters. Grandmothers told myths about the Martense ghost. The myths concerned the Martense family itself. They spoke of its difference in eye color. They spoke of its, history, and the murder that had cursed it. The terror that brought me to the scene was a. confirmation of the mountaineers ' legends. One summer night, after a thunderstorm of violence, the countryside was. A stampede of squatters occurred that no delusion could cause. The crowds of natives screamed and cried about an horror. It had come down upon them. They were not. They had not seen it. They had heard cries from one of their villages that they knew a creeping death had arrived. In the morning, townspeople and state troopers followed the trembling mountaineers. They went to the place where the death had come. Death was. The ground under one of the squatters ' villages had collapsed after a lightning strike. It destroyed of the - smelling shacks. But on top of this property damage was a devastation. This devastation made the property damage seem. Out of 75 natives who lived, not one living person could be seen. The earth was covered with blood and remains. They spoke of the damage done by demon teeth and claws. Yet no trail led from the slaughter. Evreyone agreed some animal must be the cause. No one repeated the claim. That claim said deaths were the sordid murders in decaying communities. That charge was revived when about 25 of the estimated population were found from the., it was to explain the murder of fifty by half that number. But the fact remained. On a summer night, a bolt from the sky left a village. Its corpses were mangled, chewed, and clawed. The countryside linked the horror to the Martense mansion. The places were three miles. The troopers were. They included mansion in their search. They dropped it when they found it. Country and village people,, searched the place with care. They turned over everything in the house. They measured the depth of ponds and streams. They beat down bushes. They searcehd the forests.\n###\nLocal history forbade such a doubt, although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such investigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid tale of the squatters. Grandmothers told strange myths of the Martense spectre; myths concerning the Martense family itself, its queer hereditary dissimilarity of eyes, its long, unnatural annals, and the murder which had cursed it. The terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the mountaineers\u2019 wildest legends. One summer night, after a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence, the countryside was aroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create. The pitiful throngs of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror which had descended upon them, and they were not doubted. They had not seen it, but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they knew a creeping death had come. In the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering mountaineers to the place where they said the death had come. Death was indeed there. The ground under one of the squatters\u2019 villages had caved in after a lightning stroke, destroying several of the malodorous shanties; but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic devastation which paled it to insignificance. Of a possible 75 natives who had inhabited this spot, not one living specimen was visible. The disordered earth was covered with blood and human debris bespeaking too vividly the ravages of daemon teeth and talons; yet no visible trail led away from the carnage. That some hideous animal must be the cause, everyone quickly agreed; nor did any tongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the sordid murders common in decadent communities. That charge was revived only when about 25 of the estimated population were found missing from the dead; and even then it was hard to explain the murder of fifty by half that number. But the fact remained that on a summer night a bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose corpses were horribly mangled, chewed, and clawed. The excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the haunted Martense mansion, though the localities were over three miles apart. The troopers were more sceptical; including the mansion only casually in their investigations, and dropping it altogether when they found it thoroughly deserted. Country and village people, however, canvassed the place with infinite care; overturning everything in the house, sounding ponds and brooks, beating down bushes, and ransacking the nearby forests."}

I have often wondered if all the people the professor questioned felt as puzzled as this small group did. It is good that no explanation will ever reach them. The press clippings, as I have hinted, dealt with cases of panic, madness. Odd behavior during that time. Professor Angell must have used a clipping service.

Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor\u2019s questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them. The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from California describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some \u201cglorious fulfilment\u201d which never arrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March. Voodoo orgies multiply in Hayti, and African outposts report ominous mutterings. American officers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time, and New York policemen are mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March 22\u201323. The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous \u201cDream Landscape\u201d in the Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums, that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor. The older matters which had made the sculptor\u2019s dream and bas-relief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript."}

Soon one becomes aware of matters that cause great concern. A war against the cats was being debated in that main assembly of zoogs. This started because of the loss of the group that had secretly followed the traveler to Ulthar. The cats had rightly punished them for their bad plans. This issue had bothered the zoogs for a long time. Now, or within a month, the organized zoogs planned to attack the whole cat tribe. They would use surprise attacks, catching single cats or groups off guard. They would not even let the many cats of Ulthar have a proper chance to prepare. This was the zoogs' plan. It was seen that this plan had to be stopped before leaving on the important quest.\n###\nBut presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree. He had avoided the great circle of stones, since he did not care to speak with zoogs just now; but it appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in session elsewhere. Upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion; and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern. For a war on the cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of zoogs. It all came from the loss of the party which had sneaked after Carter to Ulthar, and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions. The matter had long rankled; and now, or within at least a month, the marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a series of surprise attacks, taking individual cats or groups of cats unawares, and giving not even the myriad cats of Ulthar a proper chance to drill and mobilise. This was the plan of the zoogs, and Carter saw that he must foil it before leaving on his mighty quest."}

The pale sand went up and down like frozen sea waves. One had no goal but moved forward as if sure of fate. Draems mixed with being awake. Each large stone in the sand seemed part of endless rooms. Halls from before humans. They were carved with symbols well known from years as a captive mind of the Great Race. Sometimes it seemed those all-knowing cone-shaped horrors were moving at their usual tasks. There was fear to look dwon in case one looked like them. Yet the sand-covered blocks were still seen, as were the rooms and halls. The evil, bright moon was seen, as were the glowing crystal lamps. The endless desert was seen, as were the ferns and cycads outside the windows. One was awake and dreaming at the same time.\n###\nThe night was windless, and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves of the sea. I had no goal, but somehow ploughed along as if with fate-bound assurance. My dreams welled up into the waking world, so that each sand-embedded megalith seemed part of endless rooms and corridors of pre-human masonry, carved and hieroglyphed with symbols that I knew too well from years of custom as a captive mind of the Great Race. At moments I fancied I saw those omniscient conical horrors moving about at their accustomed tasks, and I feared to look down lest I find myself one with them in aspect. Yet all the while I saw the sand-covered blocks as well as the rooms and corridors; the evil, burning moon as well as the lamps of luminous crystal; the endless desert as well as the waving ferns and cycads beyond the windows. I was awake and dreaming at the same time."}

He made a gesture again. This caused a very bright flash in the sky. It was brighter than the earlier flashes. For three seconds, we could see a sight. That sight would trouble our dreams forever after. We saw the sky of flynig creatures. Below them was a black city. The city had huge stone levels. It had disrespectful pyramids that seemed thrown at the moon. Evil lights burned in countless windows. On walkways, we saw the city's yellow, squint-eyed people. They wore oarnge and red robes. They danced madly. Their dance followed the sound of kettle-drums, the noise of obscene rattles. The crazy moaning of muffled horns.

I saw the heavens verminous with strange flying things, and beneath them a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to the moon, and devil-lights burning from unnumbered windows. And swarming loathsomely on a\u00ebrial galleries I saw the yellow, squint-eyed people of that city, robed horribly in orange and red, and dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered kettle-drums, the clatter of obscene crotala, and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the waves of an unhallowed ocean of bitumen."}

When I had finished he studied. Takled about the steps with cleverness. His suggestions, also, were very useful. For he advised a delay of more tries at the leather strings. We should wait until we might get strength form more detailed body and machine facts. On his idea we searched the clothing store for facts about the rabbit-ear way. We found a shoe repairer who owned a wonderfully clear family book. We also spoke with such local children as had not run from the disappointment. Mix-up to simpler closures. We planned to come before our final job. This was the complete. Final study of the knot in view of its detailed make-up. Before it would be an equally complete. Final study of cirlces linked to the many failures of walker stories.\n###\nOn an afternoon in early September Arthur Munroe observed my technique. I saw from the beginning that he was both attentive and critical, and when I had finished he analysed and discussed the process with the greatest shrewdness and judgment. His advice, moreover, was eminently practical; for he recommended a postponement of further attempts at the leather laces until we might become fortified with more detailed anatomical and mechanical data. On his initiative we combed the haberdashery for information regarding the terrible bunny-ear method, and discovered a cobbler who possessed a marvellously illuminating ancestral manual. We also talked at length with such of the local children as had not fled from the frustration and confusion to simpler fastenings, and arranged to precede our culminating task\u2014the exhaustive and definitive examination of the knot in the light of its detailed construction\u2014with an equally exhaustive and definitive examination of loops associated with the various failures of pedestrian legend."}

He also baess it on certain scary messages and discoveries he gathered near the end. Those messages and dicsoveries haev affected him deeply. His voice shakes when he tells about them. His hand shakes when he tries to write about them. Throckmorton agrees that the fast spread in 2005\u201306 would normally seem to mark the start of a growing flood. This flood peaked in the awful and weird noise of 2012. He believes from his own careful study that a more detailed difference must be made. Granting admits freely taht the medium was always likely to spread things in a chaotic way. It was inclined to be too easily affected and too eager in spreading unimportant things. He refuses to agree that the early flood makred the real change from order to chaos. He gives credit instead to the original system. He says it had made possible something whose effect on hmuan talk was likely to be wonderful. He is sure the real chaos came with a later corruption. This was after the company order and the old email list had been dug up. It was after a flood of strange and unnecessary replies had been let loose. Some terrible alerts were sent under strange and automatic conditions. Certain confirmations of these messages had been clearly multiplied. A frantic discussion thread was created unedr painful and unexplained conditions. It was after the wave of repeated agreements and the worrying office gossip. And it was after the inbox's space began to leave out important messages. Meanwhile, its folders stopped working. Its digital look started the slgiht swelling. Many later complained about.\n###\nFrom this consensus, however, Mr. Throckmorton substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous observation of the digital sphere, and on certain frightful correspondences and revelations which he compiled toward the last. Those correspondences and revelations have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he recounts them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Throckmorton admits that the proliferation of 2005\u201306 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive inundation which culminated in the horrible and uncanny cacophony of 2012; but believes from personal scrutiny that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the medium was always prone to chaotic dissemination, and inclined to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in its propagation of trivialities, he refuses to concede that the early deluge marked the actual passage from order to chaos; crediting instead the original protocol that it had enabled something whose effect on human discourse was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true pandemonium, he is certain, came with a later corruption; after the corporate directive and the ancient listserv had been exhumed; after a cascade of strange and superfluous replies had been unleashed, and some terrible notifications dispatched under strange and automated circumstances; after certain acknowledgements to these dispatches had been plainly multiplied, and a frantic thread spawned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of redundant affirmations and the ominous departmental gossip; and after the inbox\u2019s capacity commenced to exclude vital missives whilst its folders failed and its digital aspect underwent the subtle bloating so many subsequently lamented."}

We were sure the lone tree on Maple Hill had been sturck again. Munroe rose from his box. He went to the window to check the damage. When he took down the shutter, the wind and rain howled deafeningly inside. I could not hear what he said. But I waited while he leaned out. He tried to understand Nature's chaos. Gradually a calming of the wind. A clearing of the unusual darkness told of the storm's passing. I had hoped it would last into the night. This would help our search. But a secret sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed that likelihood. Suggesting to Munroe that we had better get some even if more showers came, I unbarred. Opened the crude door. The ground outside was a mass of mud and pools. There were fresh piles of earth from a landslide. I saw nothing to justify the interest that kept my companion silently leaning out the window. Crossing to where he leaned, I touched his shoulder. But he did not move. Then, as I playfully shook him and turned him around, I felt it. I felt the strangling vines of a cancerous horror. Its roots reached into unlimited pasts and bottomless deeps of the night. This night broods beyond time. On the storm-tossed night of November 8, 1921, I stood with a lantern. It cast deathly shadows. I stood digging alone and foolishly in the grave of Jan Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon because a thunderstorm was brewing. Now.\n###\nAt the same time the wolfish wind rose to daemoniac crescendoes of ululation. We were sure that the lone tree on Maple Hill had been struck again, and Munroe rose from his box and went to the tiny window to ascertain the damage.

Gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness told of the storm\u2019s passing. I had hoped it would last into the night to help our quest, but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed the likelihood of such a thing.

On the tempest-racked night of November 8, 1921, with a lantern which cast charnel shadows, I stood digging alone and idiotically in the grave of Jan Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon, because a thunderstorm was brewing, and now that it was dark and the storm had burst above the maniacally thick foliage I was glad. I believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August 5th; the daemon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment, and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm. After that thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not understand. I knew that others could not understand either, so let them think Arthur Munroe had wandered away. They searched, but found nothing. The squatters might have understood, but I dared not frighten them more. I myself seemed strangely callous. That shock at the mansion had done something to my brain, and I could think only of the quest for a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination; a quest which the fate of Arthur Munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitary."}

Why, then, was it strange that some of them had visited his house? But the terror was stronger than the reassurance. Could any man be expected to look unmoved for the first time upon the claw-marks of animate beings from outer depths of space? Just then I saw Noyes emerge from the door and approach with a brisk step. I must, I reflected, keep command of myself, for the chances were this genial friend knew nothing of Akeley\u2019s profoundest and most stupendous probings into the forbidden."}

It was almost sharper than our worst reasoned fears about those others. Then came a letdown. The white shaep moved sidewyas into a side archway to our left. It joined two others of its kind. They had called it in rough tones. For it was only a penguin. But it was of a huge, unknown kind. It was larger than the biggest known king penguins. It was monstrous in its combined whiteness and near eyelessness. We followed it into the archway. We turned both torches on the uncaring group of three. We saw they were all eyeless white penguins of the same unknown giant knid. Their size reminded us of some ancient penguins shown in the Old Ones ' carvings. We soon decided they came from the same line. They undoubtedly survived by retreating to a warmer inner area. Its constant darkness destroyed their colro and shrank their eyes to useless slits. That their current home was the huge abyss we sought was not doubted for a moment. This proof of the gulf 's continued warmth. Livability filled us with very odd. Subtly disturbing thoughts. We also wondered what made these three birds leave their usual area. Silence of the great dead [THING] showed it was never a regular seasonal nesting place. The clear indifference of the three to us made it seem odd that any passing group of those others would have scared them. Was it possible those others took some hostile action or tried to get more [THING]? We doubted whether that strong smell the dogs hated could cause equal dislike in these penguins. Their ancestors had clearly lived very well with the Old Ones. This friendly relationship must have lasted in the abyss below as long as any Old Ones remained. We felt regret, in a return of the old pure science spirit, that we could not photograph these odd creatures. We soon left them to their squawking. We pushed on toward the abyss. Its openness was now so clearly proven to us. Occasional penguin tracks showed its exact direction.\n###\nBut to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an instant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others. Then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguin\u2014albeit of a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessness. When we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three we saw that they were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species. Their size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the Old Ones\u2019 sculptures, and it did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stock\u2014undoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless slits. That their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was not for a moment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf\u2019s continued warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing fancies. We wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out of their usual domain. The state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery, whilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled them. Was it possible that those others had taken some aggressive action or tried to increase their meat supply? We doubted whether that pungent odour which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins; since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms with the Old Ones\u2014an amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained. Regretting\u2014in a flareup of the old spirit of pure science\u2014that we could not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clear."}

It was dimly lit by rays the everyday [THING] can not see. The far corners were all shadows. The whole place seemed unclear and unreal. This hid its true nature. It made the imagination think of symbols and ghosts. During the time Tillinghast was silent, I imagined myself in a vast, unbelievable temple of long - dead gods. It was a vague [THING] with countless black [THING] columns. They reached up from a [THING] of damp slabs to a cloudy height I could not see. The picture was very clear for a while. But it slowly changed to a more horrible idea. It was the idea of complete, total loneliness in endless, sightless, soundless space. Theer seemed to be a void and nothing else. I felt a childlike fear. It made me pull the [THING] from my back pocket. I always carried it after dark since the night I was attacked in East Providence. Then, from the farthest areas of distance, a sound softly came into being. It was very faint. It had a subtle vibration. It was clearly musical. But it held a quality of extreme wildness. Its impact felt like a delicate torture of my whole [THING]. I felt sensations like scratching ground [THING] by accident. Then something like a cold draft developed. It seemed to sweep past me from the direction of the distant sound. I waited without breathing. I saw that both the sound and the [THING] were increasing. The effect gave me a strange idea of myself. I was tied to a pair of rails in the path of a huge, coming train. I began to speak to Tillinghast. As I did, all the unusual impressions suddenly disappeared.\n###\nHere Tillinghast seated himself directly opposite me, blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes. \u201cYour existing sense-organs\u2014ears first, I think\u2014will pick up many of the impressions, for they are closely connected with the dormant organs. Then there will be others. You have heard of the pineal gland? I laugh at the shallow endocrinologist, fellow-dupe and fellow-parvenu of the Freudian.

The far corners were all shadows, and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm. During the interval that Tillinghast was silent I fancied myself in some vast and incredible temple of long-dead gods; some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision. The picture was very vivid for a while, but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception; that of utter, absolute solitude in infinite, sightless, soundless space. There seemed to be a void, and nothing more, and I felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver I always carried after dark since the night I was held up in East Providence. Then, from the farthermost regions of remoteness, the sound softly glided into existence. It was infinitely faint, subtly vibrant, and unmistakably musical, but held a quality of surpassing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole body. I felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass. Simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught, which apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound. As I waited breathlessly I perceived that both sound and wind were increasing; the effect being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching locomotive.

Another point is that one is not a true specialist in the main fields involved. As a geologist, the goal for leading the Miskatonic University Expedition was only to get deep rock. Soil samples from different parts of Antarctic.a A special drill made by Prof was used. Frank H. Pabodie from the engineering department made it. There was no wish to be a pioneer in any other area. But it was hoped this new machine would find materials at places along known routes. Ordinary colelction methods could not reach these materials before. As the reports show, Pabodie's drill was very nwe. It was light, portable, and combined a water well drlil with a tiny rock drill. It could handle layers of different hardness quickly. The Steel heda, connected rods, gasoline motor, folding wooden tower, blasting tools, rope, waste-removal drill. Pipe sections for holes five inches wide. Up to 1000 feet dee,p plus needed parts, were not too heavy. Three sleds pulled by seven dosg each could carry it all. This was possible because of a smart aluminum alloy used for most metal parts. Four large Dornier airplanes were specially made for the high-altitude flying needed on the antarctic plateau. Pabodie added devices to warm the fuel and start the engines quickly. These planes could move the whole team from a base at the great ice barrier to good inland spots. From these spots, enough dogs would be found to help.\n###\nIt is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a geologist my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill devised by Prof. Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this; but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection. Pabodie\u2019s drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness. Steel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional piping for bores five inches wide and up to 1000 feet deep all formed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges could carry; this being made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned. Four large Dornier a\u00ebroplanes, designed especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points, and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve us."}

After learning what Legrasse had discovered about the cult, hearing about a sensitive young man would make anyone think. Thsi young man had dreamed not only of the figure. Exact markings of the statue found in the swamp. The Greenland devil tablet. He had also dreamed at least three exact words from the chant used by both Esquimau devil-worshippers. Professor Angell's immediate decision to start a thorough investigation was completely natural. However, we privately suspected young Wilcox had heard about the cult indirectly. We thought he invented a series of dreams to make the mystery greater. To trick our uncle. The professor's collection of dream stories and newspaper clippings was strong supporting evidence. Our rational thinking. The extreme nature of the whole subject made us choose waht we thought were the most sensible conclusions. After studying the manuscript again carefully. Connecting the theosophy. Anthropology notes with Legrasse's cult story, we traveled to Providence. We went to see the sculptor. Give him the scolding we thought was right for tricking a learned old man.\n###\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by Esquimau diabolists and mongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell\u2019s instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle\u2019s expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man."}

These lamps Willett lit. In their glow, he studied the shelves around him. Some of the levels were. of the space was filled with - looking jars of two types. One type was and without handles, like a lekythos or oil jug. The had a handle and was shaped like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers and were covered with - looking symbols molded in relief. In a moment, the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified. All the lekythoi were on one sied of the room with a sign reading \" Custodes \" above them. All the Phalerons were on the side, labeled with a sign reading \" Materia. \" Each of the jars. Jugs, except some on the shelves that turned out to be, bore a cardboard tag with a number. This referred to catalog. Willett decided to look for the catalog. For the moment,, he was in the nature of the collection. He opened of the lekythoi. Phalerons at to get idea. The result was the. Both types of jar contained a amount of a kind of substance. It was a powder, light in weight. In shades of, color. There was no system to the colors, which were the point of difference. There was no distinction between what was in the lekythoi. What was in the Phalerons. A - powder might be to a pinkish - one. Any powder in a Phaleron might have its match in a lekythos. The feature about the powders was their stickiness. Willett would pour one into his hand. Upon returning it to its jug, would find that no residue remained on his palm. The meaning of the two signs puzzled him. He wondered why this collection of chemicals was separated. from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory. \" Custodes, \" \" Materia \". That was the Latin for \" Guards \" and \" Materials, \". he had a memory of where he had seen that word \" Guards \" before in connection with this mystery.\n###\nThese lamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading \u201cCustodes\u201d above them, and all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly labelled with a sign reading \u201cMateria\u201d. Each of the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palm. The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \u201cCustodes\u201d, \u201cMateria\u201d; that was the Latin for \u201cGuards\u201d and \u201cMaterials\u201d, respectively\u2014and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \u201cGuards\u201d before in connexion with this dreadful mystery."}

Some secrets of the inner [THING] are not good for [THING]. This seemed to me one of them. My [THING] shook noticeably, but still I dug. After a while I stood in the large hole I had made. As the hole got deeper, the bad smell grew stronger. The hole was about six feet square. I lost all doubt about my soon touching the hellish thing. Its releases had cursed the [THING] for over a hundred and fifty years. I wondered what it would look like. I wondered what its form and substance would be. I wondered how large it might have grown through long ages of life - sucking. Finally I climbed out of the hole and spread the piled - up dirt. Then I placed the large acid bottles around and near two sides. I could empty them all down the opening quickly one after another when needed. After that I dumped [THING] only along the other two sides. I worked more slowly and put on my gas mask as the smell increased. I was almost scared out of my mind at being. Close to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit. Suddenly my spade hit something softer than [THING]. I shivered and made a move as if to climb out of the hole. It was now as deep as my neck. Then courage returned. I scraped away more dirt in the light of the electric flashlight I had brought. The surface I uncovered was fishy and glassy. It was a kind of half - rotten hardened jelly with hints of being see - through. I scraped further and saw that it had shape. There was a crack wheer a prat of the substance was folded over. The exposed area was huge and roughly tube - like. It was like a giant soft blue - white stovepipe bent in tw.o Its largest part was about two feet across. I scraped still more. Then suddenly I jumped out of the hole and away from the filthy thing. I wildly opened and tipped the heavy acid bottles. I poured their burning contents one after another down that burial pit. I poured them upon the unthinkable abnormal thing whose huge elbow I had seen. The blinidng whirlpool of greenish - yellow vapor that stormed up from that hole as the acid floods went down will never leave my memory. All along the hill [THING] tell of the yellow day. They say bad and horrible fumes rose from factory waste dumped in the Providence River. But I know they are wrong about the source.\n###\nSome secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind, and this seemed to me one of them. My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in the large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which was about six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt of my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had cursed the house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would look like\u2014what its form and substance would be, and how big it might have waxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the hole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging the great carboys of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty them all down the aperture in quick succession. After that I dumped earth only along the other two sides; working more slowly and donning my gas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit. Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep as my neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in the light of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered was fishy and glassy\u2014a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestions of translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was a rift where a part of the substance was folded over. The exposed area was huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft blue-white stovepipe doubled in two, its largest part some two feet in diameter. Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole and away from the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting the heavy carboys, and precipitating their corrosive contents one after another down that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality whose titan elbow I had seen. The blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow vapour which surged tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended, will never leave my memory. All along the hill people tell of the yellow day, when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped in the Providence River, but I know how mistaken they are as to the source."}

The city rule was strange, unpredictable, and mostyl ignored by people today. It had a very unusual nature. It clearly showed the effect of even older city laws. I knwe it well, though I never went to that area. I knew it from the very rare book by Alistair Finch. This book includes material officially written down before 1959. This material is in the city's most hidden recrods. Also, this material matched stories I heard myself from old shopkeepers in the dark streets of the next borough. Briefly summarized, it suggested a hidden system of huge payment. This system hid somewhere among the distant curbs. It was in the deep canyons of the financial district. It was in the dark alleys where business comes from unknown places. People rarely understood these devices. Signs of their existence were reported by those who went farther than normal into parts of certain streets. They went into certain deep, stee-psided parking areas that even the most desperate drivers avoided.\n###\nThe municipal ordinance, while arcane, capricious, and largely disregarded by the modern citizen, was of a most singular character, and obviously reflected the influence of still earlier civic statutes. I knew it well, though I had never frequented that district, through the exceedingly rare treatise of Alistair Finch, which embraces material bureaucratically codified prior to 1959 among the most obscure archives of the city. This material, moreover, closely coincided with accounts which I had personally heard from elderly shopkeepers in the shadowed lanes of the neighboring borough. Briefly summarised, it hinted at a hidden mechanism of monstrous exaction which lurked somewhere among the remoter curbs\u2014in the deep canyons of the financial district, and the dark alleys where commerce trickles from unknown sources. These devices were seldom understood, but evidences of their presence were reported by those who had ventured farther than usual into the precincts of certain thoroughfares or into certain deep, steep-sided metered zones that even the most desperate motorists shunned."}

The symbols of \" Dragon 's Head \" and \" Dragon 's Tail \" headed them as in Ward 's writings. But the spelling was from the versions. It was as if Curwen had a way of writing sound. Or as if study had made and versions of these calls. The doctor tried to macth the carved version with the one stuck in his head. He found it to do. Where the text he had memorized began \" Y'ai ' ng'ngah, Yog - Sothoth \", this carving started as \" Aye, engengah, Yogge - Sothotha \". To his mind this would mess up the breaks of the word. Ground as the text was fixed in his mind, the difference troubled him. He found himself saying the formula. He tried to make the sound he thought fit the letters he saw carved. and threatening in that pit of evil rang his voice. Its tone was tuned to a humming chant. This was either from the spell of the past. From the example of that, cry frmo the holes. Its rhythms rose and fell in the distance through the smell and. What was this wind that had sprung up at the start of the chant? The lamps were sputtering. The gloom grew the letters on the wall vanished. There was smoke.

They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \u201cDragon\u2019s Head\u201d and \u201cDragon\u2019s Tail\u201d heading them as in Ward\u2019s scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began \u201cY\u2019ai \u2019ng\u2019ngah, Yog-Sothoth\u201d, this epigraph started out as \u201cAye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\u201d; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word. Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness. But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That powder\u2014Great God! it had come from the shelf of \u201cMateria\u201d\u2014what was it doing now, and what had started it?

Tiredness, because I had not slept for many days. My goal was strong, because I loved my home [THING] of Lomar. The marble [THING] of Olatho\u00eb that sits between the peaks of Noton. As I stood in the highest [THING] of the tower, I saw the horned shrinking [THING], red. Evil, shaking through the mists that hung over the far valley of Banof. Through a hole in the roof shone the pale Pole Star, moving as if alive. Looking like a devil. Methought its spirit whispered bad advice, calming me into traitorous sleepiness with a terrible rhythmic promise which it said again. Again: Vainly I fought against my sleepiness, trying to link these strange worsd with some [THING] knowledge I had learned from the Pnakotic writings. My [THING], heavy. Spinning, fell to my chest. When I next looked up it was in a dream. With the Pole Star smiling at me through a [THING] from beyond the horrible moving trees of a dream swamp. And I am still dreaming. In my shame. Hopelessness I sometimes scream wildly, begging the dream beings around me to wake me before the Inutos move up the path behind the peak Noton. Capture the fortress by surprise. These beings are demons, because they laugh at me. Say I am not dreaming. They make fun of me. The short yellow enemy may be moving quietly toward us. I have fialed in my duty and betrayed the marble [THING] of Olatho\u00eb. I have been false to Alos, my friend and leader. But still these shadows of my dream mock me. They say there is no land of Lomar, except in my night imaginations. They say that in those places where the Pole Star shines high. Red Aldebaran moves low around the horizon, there has been nothing. [THING] for thousands of years. They say there has never been a [THING] there except short yellow creatures, harmed by the cold, whom they call \" Esquimaux \". I have often wondered if most [THING] evre stop to tihnk about the sometimes huge importance of dreams. Of the hidden world to which they belong.\n###\nMy brain was sore dazed with excitement and fatigue, for I had not slept in many days; yet was my purpose firm, for I loved my native land of Lomar, and the marble city of Olatho\u00eb that lies betwixt the peaks of Noton and Kadiphonek. But as I stood in the tower\u2019s topmost chamber, I beheld the horned waning moon, red and sinister, quivering through the vapours that hovered over the distant valley of Banof. And through an opening in the roof glittered the pale Pole Star, fluttering as if alive, and leering like a fiend and tempter. Methought its spirit whispered evil counsel, soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over: Vainly did I struggle with my drowsiness, seeking to connect these strange words with some lore of the skies which I had learnt from the Pnakotic manuscripts. My head, heavy and reeling, drooped to my breast, and when next I looked up it was in a dream; with the Pole Star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible swaying trees of a dream-swamp. And I am still dreaming. In my shame and despair I sometimes scream frantically, begging the dream-creatures around me to waken me ere the Inutos steal up the pass behind the peak Noton and take the citadel by surprise; but these creatures are daemons, for they laugh at me and tell me I am not dreaming. They mock me whilst I sleep, and whilst the squat yellow foe may be creeping silently upon us. I have failed in my duty and betrayed the marble city of Olatho\u00eb; I have proven false to Alos, my friend and commander. But still these shadows of my dream deride me. They say there is no land of Lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the Pole Star shines high and red Aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call \u201cEsquimaux\u201d. I have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which they belong."}

The cooks there, mostly primitive but good-natured descendants of seasoned chefs, were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown chaos which had stolen upon them in the night. It was disorder, apparently, but disorder of a more terrible sort than they had ever known; and some of their thyme and saffron had vanished since the malevolent confusion had begun its incessant reign far within the shadowed shelves where no dweller ventured.

This was through a pile of wreckage that slid. Fell behind me in a sickly hurricane. It was the evil, steady beating of that maddening moonlight that finally told me I was back.

And then, because that nightmare\u2019s position barred me from the stone staircase down which we had come, I flung myself into the oily underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea; flung myself into that putrescent juice of earth\u2019s inner horrors before the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions these pest-gulfs might conceal."}

Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite, along with Mr. Ward, visited the young man. They did not hide theri purpose. They questioned the now admitted patient in great detail. It was noted that Charles took a very long time to answer the call. When he finally appeared, he seemed agitated. Still smelled strongly of strange, harmful laboratory odors. However, he was not a difficult subject. He freely admitted that his memory. Balance had been affected by his intense study of difficult subjects. He did not resist when they insisted he move to another place. In fact, he showed a high lveel of intelligence separate from just memory. His behavior would have confused the visitors. His consistently old-fashioned way of speaking. The clear replacement of modern ideas with ancient ones in his mind marked him as someone far from normal. About his work, he told the group of doctors no more than he had previously told his family. Willett. The frantic note from the previous month was dismissed as just nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this vague bungalow had no library. Laboratory other than the visible ones. His explanation for why his clothes smelled. Strongly of odors that were not in the house was unlcear. Neighbourhood gossip was blamed on nothing more than the cheap imagination of frustrated curiosity. About the location of Dr. Allen, he said he did not feel free to speak clearly. But he assured them the bearded, spectacled man would return when needed. When paying the unemotional Brava, who resisted all questiosn from the visitors. When closing the bungalow that still seemed to hold dark secrets, he showed no sign of nervousness. The only sign was a barely noticed tendency to pause as if listening for something very faint. The subject seemed to have a calm, philosophical acceptance. It was as if the move was just a brief event that would cause the least trouble if handled quickly. It is clear that trust was placed in his obviously sharp, unaffected mind to overcome all the problems caused by his confused memory, lost voice. Secretive, odd behavior. It was agreed not to tell the mother about the change. The father would provide typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the private hospital run by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay. The hospitla was in a restful and scenic location. All the doctors conencted with the case examined and questioned him closely. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed. These included a slowed metabolism, changed skin, and unusual nerve reactions. Dr. Willett was the most troubled of the examiners. He had cared for the youth all his life. Could understand the extent of the physical changes with terrible clarity. Even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone. On his chest was a large black mole. Scra that had never been there before. This made them wonder if the youth had ever received any of the \"witch markings\" said to be given at certain unhealthy night meetings in wild, lonely places. The doctor's mind kept returning to a certain copied witch-trial record from Salem. It had been shown in the old, non-secretive days. It read: \"Mr. G. B. On that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C. Deborah B.\" The face was also horribly troubling. Finally, they suddenly discovered why they felt horror. Above the young man's right eye was something never noticed before. It was a small scar. Pit exactly like the one in the crumbling painting of old Joseph Curwen. This might prove that both had undergone some horrible ritaul inoculation at a certain stage of their secret careers.\n###\nOn Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite, accompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness. Charles, though he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance, proved a far from recalcitrant subject; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory. His conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal. Of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing. Neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiosity. Of the whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying off the stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets, Ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed; the slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate neural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and which made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the \u201cwitch markings\u201d reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and which read: \u201cMr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.\u201d Ward\u2019s face, too, troubled him horribly, till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. For above the young man\u2019s right eye was something which he had never previously noticed\u2014a small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careers."}

The observer believes the worst point came after he proved rational life could be restored. He then tried to conquer new areas by experimenting on bringing body parts back to life. He had wild ideas about the independent life of organic cells. Nerve tissue separated from natural body systems. He got some horrible early results. He created tissue that never died and was artificially fed. Tihs tissue came from nearly hatched eggs of a strange tropical reptile. He really wanted to answer two biological questions. First, can any consciousness. Rational action happen without the brain, coming from the spinal cord. Second, can any kind of non-material link exist between surgically separated parts of a once single living organism? All this research needed a huge amount of freslhy killed huamn flesh. That is why Herbert West had entered the Great War.\n###\nDangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved.

He had wild and original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and nerve-tissue separated from natural physiological systems; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of never-dying, artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an indescribable tropical reptile. Two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle\u2014first, whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain, proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve-centres; and second, whether any kind of ethereal, intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism.

We pushed the bodies out through the double hatches. We weer alone in the U-29. Klenze appeared very anxious and drank a lot of alcohol. We decided to stay alive as long as we could.

Our compasses, depth meters, and other sensitive instruments were broken. From now on, our only way to know our position would be guessing. We would base this on our watches, the calendar, and how we seemed to drift. We would judge drift by any objects we might see through the windows. From the tower. Fortunately we still had batteries that could last a long time. These were for inside lights and the searchlight. We often shone the light around the ship. We only saw dolphins.

He intended to carry on his family 's work in ethnology and antiquities. He would use the but collection of Sir Wade. His mind considered the civilization. The explorer had believed in this civilization. He would create stories about the jungle city. The explorer 's wilder notes and paragraphs mentioned this city. He felt a mix of fear and attraction toward the statements. These statements were about a nameless, race of hybrids. He wondered about the basis for such an idea. He tried to find clarity in the information. His - grandfather and Samuel Seaton had gathered this data among the Ongas. In 1911, his mother died. After this, Sir Arthur Jermyn decided to investigate as. He sold Selling a part of his property to get the needed money. He prepared an expedition and traveled by ship to the Congo. He made arrangements Arranging with the authorities for a group of guides. He spent a year in the Onga and Kaliri region. He found information than he hoped for. Among the Kaliris was an chief named Mwanu. This chief had a memory. He had a level of intelligence and interest in stories. This man verified every story Jermyn had been told. He added his story about the stone city and the apes. This story had been told to him. According to According to Mwanu, the city and the creatures were gone. The N\u2019bangus had destroyed them years. This tribe had destroyed of buildings and killed the living creatures. They had taken the preserved goddess that was the goal of their search. This was the ape - goddess that the beings worshipped. Congo tradition held that this was the form of a princess who had ruled among those beings. Mwanu had no idea what the ape - creatures could have been. But he thought they built the ruined city. Jermyn could not guess. By asking questions he got a legend about the preserved goddess. The story said the ape - princess became the wife of a god. This god had come from the West. For a time they ruled the city. But when they had a son, all three.\n###\nThough of poetic rather than scientific temperament, he planned to continue the work of his forefathers in African ethnology and antiquities, utilising the truly wonderful though strange collection of Sir Wade. With his fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which the mad explorer had so implicitly believed, and would weave tale after tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latter\u2019s wilder notes and paragraphs. For the nebulous utterances concerning a nameless, unsuspected race of jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling of mingled terror and attraction; speculating on the possible basis of such a fancy, and seeking to obtain light among the more recent data gleaned by his great-grandfather and Samuel Seaton amongst the Ongas. In 1911, after the death of his mother, Sir Arthur Jermyn determined to pursue his investigations to the utmost extent. Selling a portion of his estate to obtain the requisite money, he outfitted an expedition and sailed for the Congo. Arranging with the Belgian authorities for a party of guides, he spent a year in the Onga and Kaliri country, finding data beyond the highest of his expectations. Among the Kaliris was an aged chief called Mwanu, who possessed not only a highly retentive memory, but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends. This ancient confirmed every tale which Jermyn had heard, adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him. According to Mwanu, the grey city and the hybrid creatures were no more, having been annihilated by the warlike N\u2019bangus many years ago. This tribe, after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live beings, had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object of their quest; the white ape-goddess which the strange beings worshipped, and which was held by Congo tradition to be the form of one who had reigned as a princess among those beings. Just what the white ape-like creatures could have been, Mwanu had no idea, but he thought they were the builders of the ruined city. Jermyn could form no conjecture, but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend of the stuffed goddess. The ape-princess, it was said, became the consort of a great white god who had come out of the West. For a long time they had reigned over the city together, but when they had a son all three went away."}

It was near May when Dr. Willett talked with the young man. The senior Ward asked him to. He had all the Curwen data the family gathered from Charles when he was not secretive. The talk had little value or certainty. It was felt Charles was fully in control and knew about truly important matters. It at least made secretive young man give some logical reason for his recent behavior. He was pale and calm, not easily showing embarrassment. Ward seemed ready to discuss his activities but not their goal. It was stated his ancestor's papers hedl remarkable secrets of early scientific knowldege. Most were in cipher. Their apparent scope was only comparable to Friar Bacon's discoveries, maybe even greater. They were meaningless unless connected to field of knowledge now completely out of date. Showing them right away to a world with only modern science would remove all their impact. To have a vivid place in the history of human thought, they must first be connected by someone who knows the background they cmae from. Ward was then devoting himself to this task of connection. It can be seen he was trying to learn those neglected old arts as fast as possible. A true interpreter of the Curwen data must have them. It was hoped in time to make a full announcement. It would be of the greatest interest to humantiy and the world of thought. It was declared not even Einstein could more deeply change the current view of things.\n###\nIt was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things."}

A horrible group of toad-things came out of the hatches. Two of them grabbed us and pulled us to shore. The smell and look of that city cannot be described.

We were forced to climb countless steps in total darkness. The toad-things did not seem to care if it was light or dark. The smell of the place was unbearable.

At length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness. It was, apparently, all one to the toad-things whether it were light or dark.

In the evening, we asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath. We asked what the phrase \"strange days\" meant. Many people said it quietly. We could not get any good answers. The only thing was that the mystery was much more recent than we thought. It was not an old legend. It was something that happened in the lifetime of the people speaking. It happened in the 1880s. A family disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact. They all told us to ignore old Ammi Pierce's crazy stories. So we looked for him the next morning. We heard he lived alone in an old shaky cottage. This was where the trees start to get very thick. It was a very elderly and scary place. It had started to give off a faint bad smell. This smell cligns to houses that have stood too long. We had to knock many times to wake the old man. When he slowly came to the door, we could see he was not happy to see us. He was not as weak as we expected. But his eyes drooped in a strange way. His messy clothes and white beard made him look very tired and sad. We did not know how to get him to tell his stories. So we pretended it was a business matter. We told him about our surveying. We asked general questions about the area. He was much smarter and more educated than we were told. Before we knew it, he understood the subject as well as any man we talked to in Arkham. He was not like other country people we knew in areas where reservoirs were planned. He did not protest about the miles of old woods and farmland being destroyed. Perhaps he would have if his home was not outside the future lake's area. Relief was all he showed. He felt relief about the doom of the dark old valleys. He had roamed there all his life. They were better under water now. Better under water since the strange days. With this start, his rough voice becmae low. His body leaned forward. His right forefinger began to point in a shaky and serious way.\n###\nIn the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath, and what was meant by that phrase \u201cstrange days\u201d which so many evasively muttered. I could not, however, get any good answers, except that all the mystery was much more recent than I had dreamed. It was not a matter of old legendry at all, but something within the lifetime of those who spoke. It had happened in the \u2019eighties, and a family had disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce\u2019s crazy tales, I sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick. It was a fearsomely archaic place, and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long. Only with persistent knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he shuffled timidly to the door I could tell he was not glad to see me. He was not so feeble as I had expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious way, and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn and dismal. Not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned a matter of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague questions about the district. He was far brighter and more educated than I had been led to think, and before I knew it had grasped quite as much of the subject as any man I had talked with in Arkham. He was not like other rustics I had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief was all that he shewed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed all his life. They were better under water now\u2014better under water since the strange days. And with this opening his husky voice sank low, while his body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and impressively."}

They were able to undergo flakings and separations impossible for their foundation, and seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter sources of chemical formulation. The wood itself, but for its antique grain and peculiar fibrous properties, was strictly organic, and must have had its absolute origin within the known arboreal cycle; whereas the first sources of the other layers can only be guessed at with bated breath. All this, of course, assuming that the industrial adulterations and the imperfections ascribed to the invading elements are not pure fabrication.

Mots people beleived there was some connection between the mummy cargo and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His unusual studies and strange chemical imports were well known. People commonly suspected he liked graveyards. It did not require much imagination to link him to a strnage import. This import could not possibly have been for anyone else in the town. Curwen seemed aware of this natural belief. He maed sure to speak casually several times about the chemical value of the balms in mummies. He perhaps thought this would make the affair seem less unnatural. But he stopped just before admitting he was involved. Weeden and Smith, of course, had no doubt about the meaning of the thing.

Attaining special quality as a bean through its amazing strength, it won huge fame at the University of Mocha. At the start of the seventeenth century came back to Euroep to take a place in the coffee shops. To put a dark magic on the taste of mankind's most careful. Most smart experts. For a time all went well, until without warning the storm broke. Bitter qualities, coming from a first roasting years before in Ethiopian quiet, made themselves known in the dark drink. Only by a fast growing in the New World did it avoid a bad legal case for harm to health. Behavior of the people under its control. Its early top position broken, coffee moved east to start winning again. Before long, civilized men heard of its removal in shame from the courts of China, where it had gotten a teaching job in morning habits. Coffee now used its time for the lab. The chemist's tabel, making extracts. Mixtures on different topics linked with brain waking. Always showing a strength. Amazing that it seemed as if the public must at some time forgive it for its past too much. Its strong arguments in support of clear thought, energy, deep thought. Artistic being awake were used to itself too. In the short Indian summer of its fame there was talk of a new top position in a certain cultured house on the Continent. But then hit came. A last false claim, compared to which the others had been as nothing, broke the false ideas of those who had come to believe in coffee's improvement. The dark liquid was left by name. Went away form polite company, replaced by the soaked leaves of the Orient. Then linked it with a certain \"Arabian Mocha\" whose work for the mind. For creative groups drew a certain amount of notice because of its deep width. The Mocha soon went away from the public view. Coffee became only a name for doctors to say in warning tones. The tea-leaf soon celebrated its rule over the British Empire, a rising world power. Of its old competitor kept only enough memory to decide the naming of its weaker kinds. The mild guidance of that pale. Now, in spite of all that guidance, the true looker was at the coffee maker. About to take his first, life-giving drink.\n###\nYoung Brewster, the beverage in question, had been one of the kitchen\u2019s most remarkable potions. Attaining distinction as a bean through its wonderful potency, it won vast fame at the University of Mocha, and at the dawn of the seventeenth century returned to Europe to take up a station in the cafes and to slip a dark enchantment upon the palates of mankind\u2019s most discerning and most brilliant connoisseurs. For a season all went happily, till without warning the storm burst. Bitter properties, dating from a first roasting years before in Ethiopian seclusion, made themselves manifest in the dark elixir; and only by a hurried cultivation in the New World did it escape a nasty prosecution for injury to the humours and morals of the populations under its thrall. Its early supremacy broken, coffee moved east to begin conquest anew; but before long, civilised men heard of its dismissal in disgrace from the courts of China, where it had obtained an instructorship in morning rituals. Coffee now devoted its time to the laboratory and the chemist\u2019s platform, preparing extracts and infusions on various subjects connected with cerebral stimulation, and always shewing a potency so remarkable that it seemed as if the public must sometime pardon it for its past excesses. Its impassioned defences in favour of clarity, vigour, profundity, and artistic wakefulness were applied to itself as well, and in the short Indian summer of its glory there was talk of a renewed supremacy in a certain cultured home on the Continent. But then the blow fell. A final calumny, compared to which the others had been as nothing, shattered the illusions of those who had come to believe in coffee\u2019s refinement; and the dark fluid was abandoned by name and disappeared from polite society, replaced by the steeped leaves of the Orient. Rumour now and then associated it with a certain \u201cArabian Mocha\u201d whose work for the intellect and for creative companies attracted a certain degree of attention because of its profound breadth and depth; but the Mocha soon disappeared from the public eye, and coffee became only a name for physicians to quote in warning accents. The tea-leaf soon celebrated its dominion over the British Empire, a rising global power, and of its former rival retained only enough memory to dictate the naming of its weaker variants, and the temperate guidance of that pallid and delicate infusion. Now, in spite of all that guidance, the true seeker was at the percolator and about to take his first, revivifying draught."}

Randolph Carter dreamed of a wonderful city three times. Each time, he was taken away while he stood on a high terrace above it. The city is described as golden and beautiful in the sunset. It has walls, temples, covered walkways, and arched bridges made of patterned marble. There are fountains with silver basins spraying colorful water in wide squares and scented gardens. Wide streets go between delicate trees, pots full of flowers. Shiny rows of ivory statues. On steep slopes to the north, there are layers of red roofs. Old pointed roofs over small streets with grassy cobblestones. This was seen as a fever sent by the gods. It was like a loud blast of trumpets. A crash of cymbals from beyond this world. Mystery is noted to surround it like clouds around a legendary unclimbed mountain. As Carter is recorded standing breathless. Hopeful on that railing, it is reported taht he felt a sharp sense of almost-remembered things, the hurt of lost things. A frustrating need to put back something that once had a very important place.\n###\nThree times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvellous city, and three times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it. All golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset, with walls, temples, colonnades, and arched bridges of veined marble, silver-basined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens, and wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows; while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles. It was a fever of the gods; a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals. Mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain; and as Carter stood breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almost-vanished memory, the pain of lost things, and the maddening need to place again what once had an awesome and momentous place."}

When the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes, and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky. The sides of the rock were very steep; but on ledges here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings, and the low railings guarding travelled high roads. No ship of men had ever come so near the place, or at least, had never come so near and departed again; but Carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on, rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlands. The headlands were prolongations of the island proper, and came so closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them. There seemed to be no watchers on the outside, so the galley was steered boldly through the flume-like strait and into the stagnant foetid harbour beyond. Here, however, all was bustle and activity; with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay, and scores of almost-human slaves and moon-beasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries. There was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves, with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock. Of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite none might say, but the things one saw on the outside were far from encouraging. At sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness; those with eyes staring intently, and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly. They did not, of course, realise that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved almost-humans, and the night-gaunts were all out of sight below. By this time the leaders had fully formed a plan; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon as the wharf was touched, and then to sail directly away, leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those almost mindless creatures."}

There was no pale color, lazy smell, weak tea, or subtle aftertaste. Such a tea's relation to the stale drink in the cup might show it as a thing a sleepy person would choose. Save for that one black liquid, the simple kitchen was dark. The real stimulants were not there. The searcher had come to the ordinary cabinet in pale morning. But he did not find the wanted potion. Yet the dark fluid still shone in that one glass bottle. Its strength was almost as great as all natural energy. Its far depths and core were almost lost to feeling in thin, rising steam. The mild teas were not there, that was true. But there could be no shortage of stronger and less faint things. Where the gentle leaves are missing, the powerful beans are not absent. Certainly, the glass bottle of bottles was not without power. In what lively form. Forms wakefulness would next show itself, the student could not guess. He felt his desire had been expected. He wondered how close a watch had always been kept on him by the creeping vines of Coffea arabica. It is Coffea arabica, sign of endless energy.

The seeker had come to the common cupboard in the wan morning, but he had not found the desired elixir. Yet still the dark ichor shimmered in that one carafe whose potency was so little less than that of all earthly vigour, and whose distant depths and essence were so nearly lost to sense in thin, curling vapours. The mild infusions were not there, it was true, but of bolder and less pallid presences there could be no lack. Where the gentle leaves are absent, the potent beans are not unrepresented; and certainly, the glass carafe of carafes was far from devoid of power. In what invigorating form or forms awakening would next reveal itself, the scholar could by no means foresee. He felt that his craving had been anticipated, and wondered how close a watch had all along been kept upon him by the crawling tendrils of the vine Coffea arabica. It is Coffea arabica, harbinger of infinite vigour and dread stimulant and messenger of the Awakened State, that the fungal roasts and oily decoctions serve; and the scholar thought of the bitter draught that had materialized when the tide of torpor turned against the leaf-like inadequacies in the chipped vessel on the shelf."}

Many people said it quietly. No good answers could be gotten. The only thing was that the msytery was much more recent than thought. It was not an old legend. It was something that happened in the lifetime of the people speaking. It happened in the 1880s. A family disappeared or was killed. Speakers wuold not be exact. All advice was to ignore old Ammi Pierce's crazy stories. So he was looked for the next morning. It was heard he lived alone in an old shaky cottage. This was where the trees start to get very thick. It was a old and scary place. It had started to give off a faint bad smell. This smell clings to houses that have stood too long. The old man had to be woken by many knocks. When he slowly came to the door, it could be seen he was not happy to see his visitor. He was not as weak as expected. But his eyes drooped in a strange way. His messy clothes and white beard made him look very tired and sad. It was not known how to get him to tell his stroies. So a business matter was pretended. He was told about the surveying. General questions were asked about the area. He was much smarter and more educated than one was told. Before it was realized, he understood the subjcet as well as any man talked to in Arkham. He was not lkie other country people known in areas where reservoirs were planned. He did not protest about the miles of old woods and farmland being destroyed. Perhaps he would have if his home was not outside the future lake's area. Relief was all that was shown. He felt relief about the doom of the dark old valleys. He had roamed there all his life. They were better under water now. Better under water since the strange days. With this start, his rough voice became low. His body leaned forward. His rgiht forefinger began to point in a shaky and serious way.\n###\nIn the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath, and what was meant by that phrase \u201cstrange days\u201d which so many evasively muttered. I could not, however, get any good answers, except that all the mystery was much more recent than I had dreamed. It was not a matter of old legendry at all, but something within the lifetime of those who spoke. It had happened in the \u2019eighties, and a family had disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce\u2019s crazy tales, I sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick. It was a fearsomely archaic place, and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long. Only with persistent knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he shuffled timidly to the door I could tell he was not glad to see me. He was not so feeble as I had expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious way, and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn and dismal. Not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned a matter of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague questions about the district. He was far brighter and more educated than I had been led to think, and before I knew it had grasped quite as much of the subject as any man I had talked with in Arkham. He was not like other rustics I had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief was all that he shewed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed all his life. They were better under water now\u2014better under water since the strange days. And with this opening his husky voice sank low, while his body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and impressively."}

The ship tied up there while the captain did business in the taverns. Carter also went onto land. He looked with interest at the rough streets. Wooden ox-carts moved slowly there. Excited merchants shouted about their goods in the markets. The sea taverns were all near the docks on sotne streets. The streets were salty from tide spray. The taverns looked very They had ceilings with black beams. Their windows had greenish glass with centers. sailors in those taverns talked a lot about faraway ports. They told many stories about the men from the dim Inganok. But they added to what the ship's own sailors had said. Finally, after much loading and unloading, the ship sailed again on the sunset sea. The walls and roofs of Hlanith grew smaller. The last golden daylight gave them a wonder. Beauty greater than any people gave them. The ship sailed for two nights and two days over the Cerenerian Sea. It saw no ladn and met only one other ship. Near sunset on the second day, the snowy top of Aran appeared ahead. Ginkgo trees swayed on its lower slopes. Carter knew they had reached the land of Ooth-Nargai and the amazing city of Celepha\u00efs. Soon the shining towers of that fabled town came into view. They saw the perfect marble walls with their bornze statues. They saw the stone bridge where Naraxa meets the sea. Then the green, gentle hills behind the town rose up. They had groves and gardens of asphodel flower.s They had shrines and cottages on them. Far in distance was the purple line of Tanarians. It looked powerful and mystical. Behind it were forbidden paths to the waking world and to other dream regions. The harbor was of painted ships. Some came from the marble cloud-city of Serannian. That city lies in the air where the sea meets the sky. Some came from more solid ports on the dreamland oceans. Among these, the pilot steered his way to the spice-smelling docks. The ship tied up at dusk. The city's million lights began to twinkle over the water. This eternal city of dreams seemed very Here, time cannot damage or destroy anything.\n###\nThe wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox-carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars. The sea-taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salt with the spray of high tides, and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and casements of greenish bull\u2019s-eye panes. Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports, and told many stories of the curious men from twilight Inganok, but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told. Then, at last, after much unloading and loading, the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea, and the high walls and gables of Hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them. Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea, sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel. Then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of Aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the lower slopes, and Carter knew that they were come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and the marvellous city of Celepha\u00efs. Swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town, and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues, and the great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea. Then rose the green gentle hills behind the town, with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the purple ridge of the Tanarians, potent and mystical, behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream. The harbour was full of painted galleys, some of which were from the marble cloud-city of Serannian, that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky, and some of which were from more substantial ports on the oceans of dreamland. Among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spice-fragrant wharves, where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the city\u2019s million lights began to twinkle out over the water. Ever new seemed this deathless city of vision, for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy."}

They watched randomly in all directions for something they could not name. It was then they all agreed Thaddeus had been right about the trees. Mrs. Gardner saw it next form the window. She watched a maple's thick branches against the moonlit sky. The branches definitely moved. There was no wnid. It must be the sap. Strangeness had entered everything growing now. But the next discovery was not made by Nahum's family. Familiarity had made them less aware. What they could not see was noticed by a timid windmill salesman from Bolton. He drove by one night, not knowing the local stories. What he told in Arkham got a short piece in the Gazette. All the farmers saw it there first, including Nahum. The night was dark and the carriage lights were weak. Around a farm in the valley, which everyone knew from the story must be Nahum's, the darkness was less heavy.

The night had been dark and the buggy-lamps faint, but around a farm in the valley which everyone knew from the account must be Nahum\u2019s the darkness had been less thick.

About four hours remained for conversation if I were to catch the eight o\u2019clock coach for Arkham, and I began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler; meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch. In my donations I was careful not to overshoot the mark, for I did not wish Zadok\u2019s vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor. After an hour his furtive taciturnity shewed signs of disappearing, but much to my disappointment he still sidetracked my questions about Innsmouth and its shadow-haunted past. He would babble of current topics, revealing a wide acquaintance with newspapers and a great tendency to philosophise in a sententious village fashion. Toward the end of the second hour I feared my quart of whiskey would not be enough to produce results, and was wondering whether I had better leave old Zadok and go back for more. Just then, however, chance made the opening which my questions had been unable to make; and the wheezing ancient\u2019s rambling took a turn that caused me to lean forward and listen alertly. My back was toward the fishy-smelling sea, but he was facing it, and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low, distant line of Devil Reef, then shewing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves.

When we say Dr. West really wanted to serve in battle, we do not mean he liked war. Worried about keeping society safe. He was always a thinking machine. He was blond, blue-yeed, and wore glasses. We think he secretly laughed at our sometimes strong war feelings. Our criticism of doing nothnig. However, there was something he wanted in war-torn Flanders. To get it, he had to look like a soldier. What he wanted was not what many people want. It was related to the special area of medical sicence he had secretly chosen to study. In that area, he had gotten amazing and sometimes results. In fact, it was simply a supply of recently killed men.

There was, however, something he wanted in embattled Flanders; and in order to secure it he had to assume a military exterior. What he wanted was not a thing which many persons want, but something connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to follow, and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results. It was, in fact, nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in every stage of dismemberment."}

Earl Sawyer 's - law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie 's visit was one of curiosity. Her stories described what she saw. Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows that Old Whateley had bought from his son Curtis. This marked the start of cattle buying by Wilbur 's family. It ended in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went. Yet the Whateley barn seemed of animals. There came a time when people were to sneak up. Count the herd. It grazed on the hillside above the farmhouse. They could find than ten or twelve, - looking animals. some disease. Sickness, from the pasture. The fungi. Wood of the barn, caused deaths among the Whateley animals. wounds or sores, looking like cuts, seemed to trouble the cattle. during the months, some visitors thought they could see sores on the throats of the grey, man. His, - albino daughter. In the spring after Wilbur 's birth, Laivnia started her walks in the hills. She carried the child in her shaped arsm. interest in the Whateleys went down after country folk had seen the baby. No one bothered to comment on the development the newcomer seemed to show every day. Wilbur 's growth was. Within three months of his birth, he had reached a size. Muscle power not found in babies under a year. his sounds showed a control. Carefulness in baby. No one was when, at seven months, he began to walk without help. His stumbling was gone within another month. It was after this time, on Halloween, that a fire was seen at midnight on top of Sentinel Hill. The table - stone stands among its mound of bones. talk began wehn Silas Bishop, frmo the Bishops, mentioned seeing the boy running up that hill of his mother. This was an hour befoer the fire was noticed.\n###\nThe only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer\u2019s common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie\u2019s visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur\u2019s family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did the ramshackle Whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock. There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter. In the spring after Wilbur\u2019s birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur\u2019s growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds shewed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove. It was somewhat after this time\u2014on Hallowe\u2019en\u2014that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop\u2014of the undecayed Bishops\u2014mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked."}

We certainly did not mean to face what we feared\u2014yet I will not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden vantage-point. Probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself, though there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great circular place shewn on the crumpled sketches we had found. We had at once recognised it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in the very earliest carvings, but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture from above. Something about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these hasty diagrams, made us think that its sub-glacial levels must still form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures in which it figured\u2014being indeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings, if preserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form a good present link with the upper world\u2014a shorter route than the one we were so carefully blazing, and probably that by which those others had descended. At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches\u2014which quite perfectly confirmed our own\u2014and start back over the indicated course to the circular place; the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed twice before us. The other neighbouring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that. I need not speak of our journey\u2014during which we continued to leave an economical trail of paper\u2014for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had reached the cul de sac; except that it tended to adhere more closely to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors."}

Instead, he pretended to smile and spoke in a light tone. He chattered excitedly and wildly about happy minor things. His voice kept getting higher. Thicker until it finally broke into a high, shaky. Even his smallest comments showed that his knowledge was deep and complete. Williams was not shocked to learn he had been to Harrow and Oxford. It turned out he was actually Lord Northam. Many strange stories were told about his family's old castle on the Yorksihre coast. When Williams tried to disccuss the castle. Its rumored Roman origin, the old man would not agree there was anything odd about it. He even let out a high, silly lauggh when THE topic of the supposed underground rooms ccame up. those rooms were said to be carved from the solid rock cliff that overlooks the North Sea.\n###\nBut try as Williams would, he could not make his neighbour speak of anything profound or hidden. The old man would not live up to his aspect and manner, but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles; his voice every moment rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and incoherent falsetto. That his learning was deep and thorough, his most trivial remarks made abundantly clear; and Williams was not surprised to hear that he had been to Harrow and Oxford. Later it developed that he was none other than Lord Northam, of whose ancient hereditary castle on the Yorkshire coast so many odd things were told; but when Williams tried to talk of the castle, and of its reputed Roman origin, he refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it. He even tittered shrilly when the subject of the supposed under crypts, hewn out of the solid crag that frowns on the North Sea, was brought up."}

The night of the first discovery was hot and humid. The observer must have fallen asleep from being tired. He woke up and heard voices. He hesitates to speak of their tones and accents. He will not speak of their quality. But he can say they had strange differences in words, pronunciation, and way of speaking. Every type of New England dialect seemed part of that shadowy talk. This ranged from the rough speech of the Puritan colonists to the exact speech from fifty years ago. He only noticed this fact later. At the time, his attention was taken by another thing. This thing was so quick he could not swear it was real. He barely thought that as he woke up, a light was quickly put out inside the sunken tomb. He does not think he was very surprised or scared. But he knows he was greatly and forever changed that night. When he returned home, he went straight to a rotting chest in the attic. There he found a key. The next day, this key easily unlocked the barrier he had tried to open for. Long without success.\n###\nThe night of the first revelation was a sultry one. I must have fallen asleep from fatigue, for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that I heard the voices. Of those tones and accents I hesitate to speak; of their quality I will not speak; but I may say that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary, pronunciation, and mode of utterance. Every shade of New England dialect, from the uncouth syllables of the Puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty years ago, seemed represented in that shadowy colloquy, though it was only later that I noticed the fact. At the time, indeed, my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon; a phenomenon so fleeting that I could not take oath upon its reality. I barely fancied that as I awoke, a light had been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre. I do not think I was either astounded or panic-stricken, but I know that I was greatly and permanently changed that night. Upon returning home I went with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic, wherein I found the key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier I had so long stormed in vain."}

In this, place he made the cry that was. That he did not need to do, for as his lips opened he heard the group sound grow. Saw shadows against the stars as shapes jumped from hill to hill in gathering armies. The call of the group had been given. Before the line had time to be scared a cloud of fur. A line of killing claws were upon it like a tide. The flutes stopped, and there were screams in the night. Dying - humans screamed.

At wonder. Tiredness closed his eyes. When he opened them it was upon a scene. The shining circle of the earth, thirteen times than that of the moon as we see it, had risen with floods of light over the moon land. Across all those miles of area. top sat one sea of cats in order.\n###\nVerily, it is to the moon\u2019s dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse with ancient shadows, and here amidst that column of foetid things Carter heard their homely, friendly cry, and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home. Now much of the speech of cats was known to Randolph Carter, and in this far, terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable. But that he need not have done, for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer, and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions. The call of the clan had been given, and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it. The flutes stopped, and there were shrieks in the night. Dying almost-humans screamed, and cats spit and yowled and roared, but the toad-things made never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungi. It was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted, and Carter had never before seen so many cats. Black, grey, and white; yellow, tiger, and mixed; common, Persian, and Manx; Thibetan, Angora, and Egyptian; all were there in the fury of battle, and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of Bubastis. They would leap seven strong at the throat of an almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain, where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine battle-fury. Carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave, but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders. Then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors, and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray. At last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes, and when he opened them again it was upon a strange scene. The great shining disc of the earth, thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it, had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape; and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array."}

They said he had talked with the plastic bags. The smelly bins ever since there was any housing area to wathc his gloomy rounds from the neat lawns nearby. The evening continued. Still the homeowner watched the weekly trash removal routines. He heard how bags of regular waste fought with the slippery rotting things that leaked from tears in the liner's plastic.

And the evening wore on, and still the homeowner observed the rituals of weekly disposal, and heard how the bags of common waste battled with the slippery putrescences that oozed from tears in the liner\u2019s film, and how the leaning and overstuffed receptacle of recyclables is still glimpsed at twilight by passing cars, who know by its sight that the collection is imminent. Decades of municipal ordinances were recalled, but the custodian grew uneasy when he spoke of the dim first age of accumulation before the bins or even the sorting rules were established, and when only the stray vermin came to feast at the mound of discarded matter behind the garage in the weedy alley near the property line, beyond the cracked sidewalk."}

The light soon went out suddenly, as if he turned a corner on stone stairs. The sound also faded quickly. They were alone. But they were connected to the unknown depths by those special wires. The wire's covered surface looked green under the weak light of thin moon.\n###\nI can still hear, in memory, those coolly spoken words; and I can still remember my remonstrances. I seemed desperately anxious to accompany my friend into those sepulchral depths, yet he proved inflexibly obdurate. At one time he threatened to abandon the expedition if I remained insistent; a threat which proved effective, since he alone held the key to the thing. All this I can still remember, though I no longer know what manner of thing we sought. After he had secured my reluctant acquiescence in his design, Warren picked up the reel of wire and adjusted the instruments. At his nod I took one of the latter and seated myself upon an aged, discoloured gravestone close by the newly uncovered aperture. Then he shook my hand, shouldered the coil of wire, and disappeared within that indescribable ossuary. For a moment I kept sight of the glow of his lantern, and heard the rustle of the wire as he laid it down after him; but the glow soon disappeared abruptly, as if a turn in the stone staircase had been encountered, and the sound died away almost as quickly. I was alone, yet bound to the unknown depths by those magic strands whose insulated surface lay green beneath the struggling beams of that waning crescent moon."}

So they had no biological resaon for a family life like mammals. They seemed to form households based on comfortable use of space. As the chronicler guesses from pictures of activities. Fun among housemates, friendly mental connection. When they furnished their homes, they put everything in the middle of the huge rooms. This left all the wall space open for decoration. Lighting, for the land dwellers, was done by a device that was probably electro-chemical. Both on land and underwater, they used tables, chairs, and beds like round frames. They rested and slept standing up with their tentacles folded down.

This was not around the doors. Around the windows,. Once we imagined that a, body blocked the library window when the moon was shining on it. Another time we thought we heard a or flapping sound not. Each time we looked we found nothing. We began to think the events were imagination. It was the imagination that kept in our ears the faint howling we thought we had heard in the Holland churchyard. The amulet sat in a space in our museum. we burned candles before it. We read in Alhazred 's Necronomicon about its qualities. We read about the connection of robbers ' souls to the objects it symbolized. We were troubled by what we read. terror came. On the night of September 24, 19 \u2013 \u2013, I heard a knock at my bedroom door. Fancying it was St. John 's, I told the knocker to come in. But I was answered by a laugh. There was no one in the hallway. When I woke St. John from his sleep, he said he knew nothing about the event. He became as I. That night the, howling over the moor became to us a. Four days. We were both in the museum, there came a, scratching at the door. This door led to the library stairs. Our alarm was. Besides our fear of the, we had held a fear that our collection might be found. Extinguishing all ligths, we went to the door and threw it. we felt an rush of air. We heard what seemed like a fading a mix of rustling, giggling. We did not try to decide if we were, dreaming. In our minds. We realized, with the fears, that the bodiless talk was without doubt in the language. After that we lived in increasing horror and interest. we held to the idea that we were both going from our life of excitements. it pleased us to act as if we were the victims of some.\n###\nNow, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be frequent fumblings in the night, not only around the doors but around the windows also, upper as well as lower. Once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off. On each occasion investigation revealed nothing, and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination alone\u2014that same curiously disturbed imagination which still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the Holland churchyard. The jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum, and sometimes we burned strangely scented candles before it. We read much in Alhazred\u2019s Necronomicon about its properties, and about the relation of ghouls\u2019 souls to the objects it symbolised; and were disturbed by what we read. Then terror came. On the night of September 24, 19\u2013\u2013, I heard a knock at my chamber door. Fancying it St. John\u2019s, I bade the knocker enter, but was answered only by a shrill laugh. There was no one in the corridor. When I aroused St. John from his sleep, he professed entire ignorance of the event, and became as worried as I. It was that night that the faint, distant baying over the moor became to us a certain and dreaded reality. Four days later, whilst we were both in the hidden museum, there came a low, cautious scratching at the single door which led to the secret library staircase. Our alarm was now divided, for besides our fear of the unknown, we had always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered. Extinguishing all lights, we proceeded to the door and threw it suddenly open; whereupon we felt an unaccountable rush of air, and heard as if receding far away a queer combination of rustling, tittering, and articulate chatter. Whether we were mad, dreaming, or in our senses, we did not try to determine. We only realised, with the blackest of apprehensions, that the apparently disembodied chatter was beyond a doubt in the Dutch language. After that we lived in growing horror and fascination. Mostly we held to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements, but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatise ourselves as the victims of some creeping and appalling doom."}

Many people could not sleep. Around 3 A.M. All the shared telephones rang shaking. Those who answered heard a frightened mad voice shriek \"Help oh my Gawd! . . .\" Some thought a crashing sound came after the cry stopped. There was nothing more. No one dared do anything. No one knew where the call came form until morning. Then those who heard it called everyone on the phone line. They found only the Fryes did not answer. The truth came an hour later. A quickly gathered group of armed men walked out to the Frye place at the valley head. It was but hardly a surprise. There were more crushed paths and monster prints. But there was no house anymore. It had collapsed like eggshell. In the ruins nothing living or dead could be found. Only a smell and a sticky tar-like substance.

First, he thought these things were repulsive because they showed complete inhumanity. Cruel indifference in Pickman. The person must be a fierce enemy of all people to enjoy causing mental. Damaging the human body. Second, they were frightening because they were so well done. art was very convincing. When he saw the pictures, he saw the demons themselves and felt afraid. The strange thing was that Pickman did not get his power from being selective. Nothing was not blurred, distorted, or made in a common style. The outlines were clear and realistic, and details were shown with almost painful accuracy. And the faces!\n###\nAs I gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of deviltry and morbidity, I began to analyse some of the points in my sickening loathing. In the first place, I said to myself, these things repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous cruelty they shewed in Pickman. The fellow must be a relentless enemy of all mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the degradation of the mortal tenement. In the second place, they terrified because of their very greatness. Their art was the art that convinced\u2014when we saw the pictures we saw the daemons themselves and were afraid of them. And the queer part was, that Pickman got none of his power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie.

He told the tired attendants Norris and Kaleen-Thorne about this setup. The attendants shook their heads with badges and said it would drain his spirit. They pointed out that the Municipal Planners had already shown their plan. Thye do not like being bothered by repeated questions. They also reminded him that no driver ever found the elusive space B-47. No driver ever learned what area of the building it might be in. It could be in the north section next to the service elevators. It could be in the areas near some unlit hallway on sub-level three. The west stairs. If in the north section, it might possibly be found. Only three fully aware people since the garage opened had ever gone through the gray, boring turns to othre sub-levels. Of those three, two came back very confused. In such journeys, there are countless space uncertainties. There is also that maddening final frustration. It hides beyond the numbered rows where no signs go. That last shapeless ruin of deepest disorder mocks. Grows at the heart of all the concrete maze. It is the endless, giant structure itself. Its true plan no mind dares to understand. It spreads forever in unbelievable, fluorescent-lit rooms beyond the hourly rate. This is amdist the muffled, maddening echo of far-off engines. The constant whine of ventilation. To these hateful echoes and drone move slowly, clumsily, and foolishly the hueg, unknown vehicles. Thye are the blind, voiceless, careless mechanical giants. Their keepre and messenger is the creeping, oily stain on the floors.\n###\nIn dim recollection he descended the seven ramps to the concrete abyss and spoke of this configuration to the weary attendants Norris and Kaelen-Thorne. And the attendants shook their badge-bearing heads and vowed it would be the exhaustion of his spirit. They pointed out that the Municipal Planners had shewn already their design, and that it is not agreeable to them to be pestered by repeated inquiries. They reminded him, too, that not only had no driver ever found the elusive space B-47, but no driver had ever ascertained in what zone of the structure it may reside; whether it be in the northern annex adjacent to the service elevators, or in those shadowy reaches abutting some unlit corridor of sub-level three or the western stairwell. If in the northern annex, it might conceivably be located; but only three fully cognizant souls since the garage\u2019s opening had ever navigated and re-navigated the grey, monotonous turns to other sub-levels, and of that three two had returned quite disoriented. There were, in such peregrinations, incalculable spatial ambiguities; as well as that maddening ultimate frustration which lurks ineffably beyond the numbered rows, where no signage reaches; that last amorphous blight of nethermost disarray which mocks and festers at the heart of all the concrete labyrinth\u2014the boundless, cyclopean structure itself, whose true layout no mind dare comprehend, and which sprawls endlessly in inconceivable, fluorescent-lit chambers beyond the hourly rate amidst the muffled, maddening echo of distant engines and the thin, monotonous whine of failing ventilation; to which detestable reverberations and drone move slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic, anonymous vehicles, the blind, voiceless, tenebrous, heedless mechanical leviathans whose custodian and herald is the creeping, oily residue upon the floors."}

They must have survived by moving to a warmer inner area. The constant darkness there destroyed their color and made their eyes shrink to useless slits.

Ward\u2019s father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed. Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents\u2019 old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time."}

It hinted at secrets worse than normal dust. Housekeepers compalin about dust. Cleaners and renovators lament it. Malone had both imagination and knowledge of old things. He kenw modern attics can strangely copy ancient atmospheres. Forgotten conditions make them feel very old and stlil. He often looked at old beams with creeping stains. Damp spots and mildew covered them. They wound through small spaces under the eaves. He saw signs of decay everywhere. Sometimes in piles of old furniture on shadowy floors. Sometimes in trunks leaking from broken locks. Sometimes in stacks of yellowed papers near a gable window. Sometimes in cobwebs around dirty hatboxes near rafters. These things chilled and fascinated him. He did not tell his household friends. He saw a monstrous thread of secret continuity. He saw an ancient, strange bad air. It was beyond normal lint, mothballs, and clutter. The owners carefully listed that clutter. He felt it was the breath of shocking, ancient stagnation. It was bad air from materials older than the house. Its persistence and definiteness suggested this. A strange suspicion of awareness lurked beneath it. He had read books like Miss Wharton's *The Decoration of Houses*. He knew old mansions kept frightful, secret vapors. These came from dark places older than the modern world. People call them ghostly damp and must. He could not believe these hellish old Turanian-Asiatic dry-rot traces were dead. He often wondered how much older and darker they were than the worst household stories.\n###\nMalone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more terrible than any of the common dusts denounced by housekeepers and bemoaned by cleaners and renovators. He was conscious, as one who united imagination with antiquarian knowledge, that modern attics under forgotten conditions tend uncannily to repeat the most desolate atmospheric patterns of primordial and half-rotten antiquity in their silent air and spectral stillness; and he had often viewed with a connoisseur\u2019s shudder the creeping, spreading stains of damp-spotted and mildew-furred old beams which wound their way along in the dim small spaces under eaves. One saw traces of this decay incessantly; sometimes in leering heaps of discarded furniture on shadowy floorboards, sometimes in trunks exuding eerily from cheap and broken locks, sometimes in stupefied piles of yellowed papers or indecipherable ledgers around forgotten desks near the gable window, and sometimes in whispering drifts of cobweb around dingy hatboxes drawn up at the high rafters of crumbling and closely boarded-up old dormers. They chilled and fascinated him more than he dared confess to his associates in the household, for he seemed to see in them some monstrous thread of secret continuity; some eldritch, cryptical, and ancient miasma utterly beyond and below the sordid mass of lint and mothballs and clutter listed with such conscientious domestic care by the owners. They must be, he felt inwardly, the exhalations of some shocking and primordial stagnation; the emanations of debased and broken effluvia from materials and substances older than the house itself. Their persistence and definiteness suggested it, and it shewed in the singular suspicion of sentience which lurked beneath their inert diffusion. He had not read in vain such treatises as Miss Wharton\u2019s *The Decoration of Houses*; and knew that up to recent years there had certainly survived among old mansions and furtive spaces a frightful and clandestine accumulation of vapors and miasmas descended from dark recesses antedating the modern world, and appearing in popular accounts as ghostly damp and spectral must. That these hellish vestiges of old Turanian-Asiatic dry-rot and wood-mould were even now wholly dead he could not for a moment suppose, and he frequently wondered how much older and how much blacker than the very worst of the muttered household legends some of them might really be."}

Gilman was moving almost without control in the dark deep places with the bubble mass. The small many-sided shape floating in front. Then he saw the very regular corners made BY the edges of some huge nearby crystal groups. A moment later, he was out of the deep plaec. He stood shaking on a rocky hillside covered in stronng, spreading green light. He had no shoes and wore his night clothes. When he tried to walk, HE found he could hardly raise his feet. A turning mist hid everything except the close sloping ground from view. He feared the noises that might come from that mist.\n###\nDuring the night of April 19\u201320 the new development occurred. Gilman was half-involuntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the bubble-mass and the small polyhedron floating ahead, when he noticed the peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic neighbouring prism-clusters. In another second he was out of the abyss and standing tremulously on a rocky hillside bathed in intense, diffused green light. He was barefooted and in his night-clothes, and when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet. A swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight, and he shrank from the thought of the sounds that might surge out of that vapour."}

However, other subjecst troubled him more and more. He developed an intuitive skill ffor solving Riemannian equations. He amazed Professor Upham with his understanding of fourth-dimensional problems. These problems had confused the rest of the class. One afternoon, they discussed possible strange curves in space. They talked aabout theoretical points where our part of the cosmos might approach. Even touch other distant regions. TThese regions could be as far as the farthest stars or the gaps between galaxies. They could even be as remote as the tentatively imaginable cosmic units beyond the whole Einsteinian space-time continuum. Gilman's treatment of this topic made everyone admire him. Yet, some of his hypothetical examples caused moer gossip. Peolpe already often talked about his nervous and solitary odd behavior. What made the students doubt was his serious theory.

Architraves of living fire shone brightly around the spot where we seemed to float in air. They extended up to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendor.

Through a nearly square opening in the tiled floor, sprawling on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that it was little more than an inclined plane at the centre, was a ghastly array of human or semi-human bones. Those which retained their collocation as skeletons shewed attitudes of panic fear, and over all were the marks of rodent gnawing. The skulls denoted nothing short of utter idiocy, cretinism, or primitive semi-apedom. Above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage seemingly chiselled from the solid rock, and conducting a current of air. This current was not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed vault, but a cool breeze with something of freshness in it. We did not pause long, but shiveringly began to clear a passage down the steps. It was then that Sir William, examining the hewn walls, made the odd observation that the passage, according to the direction of the strokes, must have been chiselled from beneath. After ploughing down a few steps amidst the gnawed bones we saw that there was light ahead; not any mystic phosphorescence, but a filtered daylight which could not come except from unknown fissures in the cliff that overlooked the waste valley. That such fissures had escaped notice from outside was hardly remarkable, for not only is the valley wholly uninhabited, but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an a\u00ebronaut could study its face in detail. A few steps more, and our breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw; so literally that Thornton, the psychic investigator, actually fainted in the arms of the dazed man who stood behind him. Norrys, his plump face utterly white and flabby, simply cried out inarticulately; whilst I think that what I did was to gasp or hiss, and cover my eyes. The man behind me\u2014the only one of the party older than I\u2014croaked the hackneyed \u201cMy God!\u201d in the most cracked voice I ever heard. Of seven cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure; a thing more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight first.

Those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street-lamps\u2019 absence and gone down into the body of the church, flopping and bumping around in a viscous, altogether dreadful way. Toward the last it had bumped up to the tower, where there were sounds of the shattering of glass. It could go wherever the darkness reached, but light would always send it fleeing."}

Lived with her father in Power 's Lane until her death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, avoided by every living person, remained to decay through the years. It seemed to fall with speed. By 1780 the stone and brickwork were standing. By 1800 these had fallen into piles. No one dared to push through the bushes on the riverbank behind which the hillside door may have been. Nor did anyone try to form a picture of the scenes where Joseph Curwen left the horrors he had created. Capt. Whipple was heard by listeners to mutter to himself.: \" A curse on that. He had no right to laugh. It 's as thuogh the damned had something up his sleeve. For a coin I 'd burn his house. \" Charles Ward, as we have seen, learned in 1918 of his family line frmo Joseph Curwen. That he at took a interest in everything about the mystery is not. Every rumor he had heard of Curwen became something to himself, in whom Curwen 's blood flowed. family researcher could have done than start at a. collection of Curwen information. In his searches there was not the attempt at secrecy. Dr. Lyman hesitates to date man 's madness from any time before the end of 1919. He talked with his familyand with the officials of the museums. Libraries he visited. In asking families for records thought to be in their possession, he did not hide his goal. He shared the doubt with which the accounts of the diary writer.s Letter writers were viewed. He expressed a curiosity about what had happened a century. A half at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose location he tried in vain to find. And he wondered what Joseph Curwen had been. When he found the Smith diary. Came upon the letter from Jedediah Orne, he decided to visit Salem. Look up Curwen 's activities.

The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living soul, remained to moulder through the years; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which the hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought. Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself, \u201cPox on that \u2014\u2014\u2014, but he had no business to laugh while he screamed. \u2019 Twas as though the damn\u2019d \u2014\u2014\u2014 had some\u2019at up his sleeve. For half a crown I\u2019d burn his \u2014\u2014\u2014 house.\u201d Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwen\u2019s blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data. In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youth\u2019s madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family\u2014though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen\u2014and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been. When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwen\u2019s early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919."}

Householders are extremely particular people. The experienced residents who cared for the endless hedges, the stylish flower beds. The large lawns of the Smiths, the Carters. The Whateleys all made odd, secret signs of dislike. They did this when they saw the thin, deceptively normal-looking trash bag. It was black plastic with a slight bulge, waiting for pickup on the curb of Elm Street. Standing guard near gates. Driveways where the neighborhood cats prowled restlessly. The people living in the house itself feared and hated it. All its contents were mixed waste from forgotten meals, thrown-away wrappers, dirty papers. In a way, it was how often these bags were filled that caused the sharpest. Most real part of the hatred for the task. A bin would be placed on the curb for collection. Some of its contents might be leaking with this or that fluid. When brought back, it would almost certainly contain one or mroe horrible things. Many of the leftovers had rotted in the summer sun's heat. Few of the bags were ever carried without some bad tear. This was not forgotten. So in time, it became very hard to finish the oddly disgusting duty. Almost without fail, several would delay soon after hearing the neighborhood gossip. Tehir eventual cooperation became an increasingly great burden for the resident.\n###\nIt was near the refuse bins along the southerly part of the suburban lane, however, that the worst things were muttered about the weekly chore. Householders are fastidious folk; and the seasoned residents who maintained the infinite hedgerows, the rakish flower-beds, and the great lawns of the Smiths, the Carters, and the Whateleys, all made strange furtive signs of distaste when they saw the slim, deceptively mundane-looking receptacle with its black plastic and slight bulge awaiting collection on the kerb of Elm Street or standing sentinel near the gates and driveways where the neighbourhood cats prowled restlessly. The household\u2019s own occupants dreaded and abhorred it, and all its contents were mongrel detritus from forgotten meals, discarded wrappings, soiled papers, or broken vessels. It was, in a way, the frequency with which these bags were filled which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the loathing in which the task was held. A bin would be placed upon the kerb for collection, some of its contents perhaps seeping with this ichor or that; and when retrieved it would be almost sure to contain one or more horrors. That many of the leavings had festered in the heat of the summer sun, and that few of the bags had ever been borne without some grievous rupture, was not forgotten; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult to complete the oddly repulsive duty. Almost invariably several would procrastinate soon after hearing the gossip of the cul-de-sac, and their eventual compliance became an increasingly great trial to the resident."}

It was especially exciting for Inspector Legrasse. He immediately asked his informant many questions. Having said he noted. Copied a spoken ritual from the swamp cult members his men arrested. He asked the professor to try to remember the sounds recorded among the devil-worshipping Esquimaux. Then they compared all details carefully. There was a moment of silent awe. Both the detective and the scientist agreed. The phrase from two evil rituals was almost the same, though from places far apart. In essence, both the Esquimau wizards.

At five o'clock ad.\n###\nAt five o\u2019clock adieux were waved, and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned its nose seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was cleared, and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean. Whether the tramp steamer or the scream was first to gain attention, no one can say. Probably they were simultaneous, but it is of no use to calculate. The scream came from the Suydam stateroom, and the sailor who broke down the door could perhaps have told frightful things if he had not forthwith gone completely mad\u2014as it is, he shrieked more loudly than the first victims, and thereafter ran simpering about the vessel till caught and put in irons. The ship\u2019s doctor who entered the stateroom and turned on the lights a moment later did not go mad, but told nobody what he saw till afterward, when he corresponded with Malone in Chepachet. It was murder\u2014strangulation\u2014but one need not say that the claw-mark on Mrs. Suydam\u2019s throat could not have come from her husband\u2019s or any other human hand, or that upon the white wall there flickered for an instant in hateful red a legend which, later copied from memory, seems to have been nothing less than the fearsome Chaldee letters of the word \u201cLILITH\u201d. One need not mention these things because they vanished so quickly\u2014as for Suydam, one could at least bar others from the room until one knew what to think oneself. The doctor has distinctly assured Malone that he did not see IT. The open porthole, just before he turned on the lights, was clouded for a second with a certain phosphorescence, and for a moment there seemed to echo in the night outside the suggestion of a faint and hellish tittering; but no real outline met the eye. As proof, the doctor points to his continued sanity. Then the tramp steamer claimed all attention. A boat put off, and a horde of swart, insolent ruffians in officers\u2019 dress swarmed aboard the temporarily halted Cunarder. They wanted Suydam or his body\u2014they had known of his trip, and for certain reasons were sure he would die. The captain\u2019s deck was almost a pandemonium; for at the instant, between the doctor\u2019s report from the stateroom and the demands of the men from the tramp, not even the wisest and gravest seaman could think what to do."}

To object rather than state, is very strong. It is needed to tell the rest to explain my choice in advising against further visits. We had made our way very close to the guessed location of the business's entrnace. We had crossed a sun-beaten parking lot to what seemed clearly the front of a low, business building. We entered a fluorescent-lit hallway especially full of brightly fake. Clearly mass-made ads of recent make. Then, about 4:30 P.M., my friend's sharp old eyes gave us the first hint of something wrong. If we had had a more noticing nature, I guess we wolud have been wraned earlier. At first we could not exactly say what was off in the formerly clean. But after a few moments, our senses reacted only too clearly. Let let me try to describe the situation without lying. There was a smell. That smell was vaguely, subtly. Unmistakably like what had hit us upon opening the overstuffed closet of the bright vest my uncle had once bought.\n###\nI come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to demur rather than declare, is very potent. It is necessary, however, to recount the remainder in order to justify my course in discouraging further patronage. We had threaded our way very close to the presumed location of the establishment\u2019s entrance\u2014having traversed a sun-blasted parking lot to what seemed plainly the facade of a squat, commercial edifice, and entered into a fluorescent-lit corridor especially rich in garishly synthetic and apparently mass-produced advertisements of recent vintage\u2014when, about 4:30 P.M., my companion\u2019s keen old eyes gave us the first intimation of something amiss. If we had possessed a more discerning nature, I suppose we would have been forewarned before. At first we could not precisely articulate what was aberrant in the formerly sterile and artificial atmosphere, but after a few moments our senses reacted only too unequivocally. Let me attempt to articulate the circumstance without prevarication. There was an emanation\u2014and that emanation was vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably analogous to what had assailed us upon opening the overstuffed closet of the garish waistcoat my uncle had once procured."}

On the far white horizon behind the strange city, a faint, delicate line of violet peaks was now visible. Their sharp points appeared dreamlike against the inviting pink of the western sky. The ancient highland sloped up toward this shimmering edge. The old river's sunken path crossed it like an uneven shadow ribbon. For a moment, one is amazed by the scene's unearthly cosmic beauty. Then a vague horror begins to enter the mind. This distant violet line could only be the terrible mountains of the forbidden land. They are the highest peaks on Earth and the center of Earth's evil. They hold unknonw horrors and Archaean secrets. People who fear to understand their meaning avoid them and pray to them. No living thing on Earth walks there. Sinister lightning visits them. They send strange beams across the plains during the ploar night. They are without doubt the unknown original form of that feared Kadath in the Codl Waste beyond the hated Leng. Unholy ancient legends hitn about this vaguely. It is noted that these were the first such peaks ever seen by humans.

For a second we gasped in admiration of the scene\u2019s unearthly cosmic beauty, and then vague horror began to creep into our souls. For this far violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of the forbidden land\u2014highest of earth\u2019s peaks and focus of earth\u2019s evil; harbourers of nameless horrors and Archaean secrets; shunned and prayed to by those who feared to carve their meaning; untrodden by any living thing of earth, but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending strange beams across the plains in the polar night\u2014beyond doubt the unknown archetype of that dreaded Kadath in the Cold Waste beyond abhorrent Leng, whereof unholy primal legends hint evasively.

The things that made the sculptor 's dream. to my ucnle were the subject of the half of his manuscript. It seems had seen the shape of the nameless monster before Professor Angell. He had puzzled over the symbols. Heard the threatening sounds that can be written as \" Cthulhu. \" All this happende in such a striring. way that it is no wonder he questioned Wilcox. Asked for information. The experience happened in 1908, seventeen years, when the American Archaeological Society held its meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as was for a man of his rank. Knowledge, played a leading part in all the discussions. He was one of the people approached by outsiders. These outsiders used the meeting to ask questions and problems for experts to solve. The outsider, who became the focus of the meeting, was an - looking - ma.n He had come all the way from New Orleans for information he could not get. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was an Inspector of Police by profession. He brought with him the reason for his visit. It was a,, and - looking stone statue. He did not know where it came from. You must not think Inspector Legrasse had any interest in archaeology., his wish for knowledge came from reasons. The statue, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had been captured months. It was taken in the wooded swamps of New Orleans during a raid on a suspected voodoo meeting. rituals linked to it were. that the police realized they had found a cult to them. It was than the voodoo groups. from the wild. stories forced from the captured members, nothing could be found about its origin. police were for any knowledge that might help them identify the symbol. They hoped to track down the cult to its source trhough it.\n###\nBut I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor. The older matters which had made the sculptor\u2019s dream and bas-relief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript. Once before, it appears, Professor Angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity, puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics, and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as \u201cCthulhu\u201d; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connexion that it is small wonder he pursued young Wilcox with queries and demands for data. The earlier experience had come in 1908, seventeen years before, when the American Archaeological Society held its annual meeting in St. Louis. Professor Angell, as befitted one of his authority and attainments, had had a prominent part in all the deliberations; and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution. The chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head."}

It left a permanent mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett. It added ten years to the apparent age of one person whose yotuh was already far behind. Dr. Willett had long discussions with Mr. Wrad. They reached an agreement on several points. They boht felt psychiatrists would laugh at these points. They admitted there was a terrible movement active in the world. Its direct conenction to a magic older than Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. It was also alomst certainly proven that at least two living men. One other they dared not think about, completely possessed minds. Personalities that existed as early as 1690. This was true even against all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures. Charles Ward as well, wree doing. Trying to do seemed fairly clear. They knew from their letters and from all old and new information about the case. They were robbing tombs from all periods, including those of the world's wisest.

The building's paint was once white but was now gray and peeling. black and gold sign was on the pediment. It was so faded the words \"Esoteric Order of Dagon\" could barely be read.

Then we would watch alone until dawn in two - hour periods. I would go first, then my companion. The [THING] not watching would rest on the cot. My uncle got the tools form the laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armoury. He naturally took charge of our task. This was a wonderful example of the possible strength and toughness of an eighty - one - year - old [THING]. Elihu Whipple had lived by the helath rules he taught as a doctor. If not for what happened later, he would be here in flul strength today. Only two [THING] suspect what did happen \u2014 Carrington Harris and myself. I had to tell Harris because he owned the [THING]. He deserved to know what had left it. Also, we had talked to him before our search. I felt after my uncle 's death that he would understand. Help me with some very needed public explanations. He became very pale but agreed to help me. He decided it would now be safe to rent the [THING]. To say we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching would be a huge. We were not, as I said, in any way childishly superstitious. Thought had taught us that the known universe of three diemnsions includes the smallest part of the whole cosmos of matter. In this case, a very large amount of proof from many real sources pointed to the stubborn existence of certain forces of great power. From the human point of view, these forces were of exceptional harmfulness. To say we actually believed in vampires or werewolves would be a careless, broad statement. Rather must it be said that we were not ready to deny the chance of certain unknown. Unclassified changes of life force. These exist very rarely in three - dimensional space because of a closer link with other space units. They are near enough to the edge of our own to give us occasional signs. We, lacking a proper position, may never hope to understand these signs. In short, it seemed to my uncle. Me taht a solid group of facts pointed to some remaining influence in the avoided [THING]. This could be traced to one. Another of the bad - looking French settlers from two hundred years before. It was still working through rare and unknown laws of atomic and electronic movement.\n###\nIt was our design to sit up together till very late, and then watch singly till dawn in two-hour stretches, myself first and then my companion; the inactive member resting on the cot. The natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments from the laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armoury, and instinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a marvellous commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of eighty-one. Elihu Whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws he had preached as a physician, and but for what happened later would be here in full vigour today. Only two persons suspect what did happen\u2014Carrington Harris and myself. I had to tell Harris because he owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it. Then too, we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after my uncle\u2019s going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally necessary public explanations. He turned very pale, but agreed to help me, and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house. To declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching would be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous. We were not, as I have said, in any sense childishly superstitious, but scientific study and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance and energy. In this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence from numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of certain forces of great power and, so far as the human point of view is concerned, exceptional malignancy. To say that we actually believed in vampires or werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement. Rather must it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility of certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and attenuated matter; existing very infrequently in three-dimensional space because of its more intimate connexion with other spatial units, yet close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasional manifestations which we, for lack of a proper vantage-point, may never hope to understand. In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house; traceable to one or another of the ill-favoured French settlers of two centuries before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws of atomic and electronic motion."}

Looking toward the giant willow in the centre of the cemetery, whose trunk has nearly engulfed an ancient, illegible slab, I had made a fantastic remark about the spectral and unmentionable nourishment which the colossal roots must be sucking in from that hoary, charnel earth; when my friend chided me for such nonsense and told me that since no interments had occurred there for over a century, nothing could possibly exist to nourish the tree in other than an ordinary manner. Besides, he added, my constant talk about \u201cunnamable\u201d and \u201cunmentionable\u201d things was a very puerile device, quite in keeping with my lowly standing as an author.

I offered to go with the cohort on any mission it might carry out. I noted that the Vascones were at and. Clashes with them were, what we decided. They had not been opponents for our legions. It would be for the officials of the Roman People to let barbarians block a path that the fairness. Honor of the Republic required. On the hand, running a province relied on the security. Support of the part of the population. They controlled the systems of trade and wealth. Their veins carried a amount of our blood. These people might be in number, but they were the part. Their loyalty could be trusted. Their help would tie the province to the Imperium of the Senate. It was both an obligation. A benefit to give them the protection owed to citizens. This was. I gave a mocking glance at Balbutius. Asellius, if it cost some effort. It might interrupt the dice games and cockfights at the camp in Calagurris. I could not question from my studies that the threat to the town. People of Pompelo was. I had read scrolls from Syria and \u00c6gyptus, and the towns of Etruria. I had spoken at length with the priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods near Lacus Nemorensis. There were fates that could be summoned from the hills on the Sabbaths. These were fates that should not be inside the lands of the Roman People. Allowing parties of the sort known to happen at Sabbaths would match the traditions of those whose ancestors, when A. Postumius was consul, had put to death citizens for practicing the Bacchanalia. This event is remembered by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, carved on bronze. Displayed for all to see. Checked in time, before the advancement of the rituals might call forth something that the iron of a spear might not handle, the Sabbath would not be beyond the abilities of one cohort.\n###\nI, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake. I pointed out that the barbarous Vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain, so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever course we might take; that they had not in the past proved dangerous adversaries to our legions, and that it would ill become the representatives of the Roman People to suffer barbarians to interfere with a course which the justice and prestige of the Republic demanded. That, on the other hand, the successful administration of a province depended primarily upon the safety and good-will of the civilised element in whose hands the local machinery of commerce and prosperity reposed, and in whose veins a large mixture of our own Italian blood coursed. These, though in numbers they might form a minority, were the stable element whose constancy might be relied on, and whose cooperation would most firmly bind the province to the Imperium of the Senate and the Roman People. It was at once a duty and an advantage to afford them the protection due to Roman citizens; even (and here I shot a sarcastic look at Balbutius and Asellius) at the expense of a little trouble and activity, and of a slight interruption of the draught-playing and cock-fighting at the camp in Calagurris. That the danger to the town and inhabitants of Pompelo was a real one, I could not from my studies doubt. I had read many scrolls out of Syria and \u00c6gyptus, and the cryptic towns of Etruria, and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of Diana Aricina in his temple in the woods bordering Lacus Nemorensis. There were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the Sabbaths; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the Roman People; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at Sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers, A. Postumius being consul, had executed so many Roman citizens for the practice of the Bacchanalia\u2014a matter kept ever in memory by the Senatus Consultum de Bacchanalibus, graven upon bronze and set open to every eye. Checked in time, before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a Roman pilum might not be able to deal, the Sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort."}

He said Akeley had a sudden asthma attack. Akeley did not feel well enough to travel outside. It was not seroius. There would be no change to the plans for his visit. He could not tell how much this Mr. Noyes knew about Akeley's work and finds. He introduced himself as Mr. Noyes. His relaxed manner seemed to mark him as somewhat of an outsider. Remembering Akeley had been such a hermit. The writer was a little surprised such a freind was so easily available. But he did not let his confusion stop him. He got into the car the man pointed to. It was not the small old car he expected from Akeley's descriptions. It was a large, very clean car of a recent model. It seemed to be Noyes's own car. It had Massachusetts license plates. They had that year's funny \"sacred codfish\" design. He decided his guide must be someone staying for the summer in the Townshend area.\n###\nAs I surveyed him I heard him explaining that he was a friend of my prospective host\u2019s who had come down from Townshend in his stead.

He is seen to jump when the yougn man enters. Then the book is seen and a violent shake occurs. A faint happens when the title is said. Upon waking up, the story is told. That crazy story is recounted in frantic whispers. This is so one's friend will burn the cursed book quickly and scatter its ashes.\n###\nThe one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him into transports, and some of the diagrams set in the vague Latin text excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections in his brain. He felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin deciphering it, and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste that the old Jew chuckled disturbingly behind him. But when at last it was safe in his room he found the combination of black-letter and debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist, and reluctantly called on his strange, frightened friend for help with the twisted, mediaeval Latin. Lord Northam was simpering inanities to his streaked cat, and started violently when the young man entered. Then he saw the volume and shuddered wildly, and fainted altogether when Williams uttered the title. It was when he regained his senses that he told his story; told his fantastic figment of madness in frantic whispers, lest his friend be not quick to burn the accursed book and give wide scattering to its ashes."}

His throat was aching inexplicably, and as he struggled to a sitting posture he saw with growing fright that his feet and pajama-bottoms were brown with caked mud.

His first action was to lean back into the cushion. He stared at the cracked surface almost right in front of his eyes. As he listened he thought a faint whispering sound of settling dust.

He was wholly isolated, and his first act was to lean back into the cushion and gaze fixedly at the ancient, cracked surface almost directly before his eyes. As he listened he thought a faint susurration of settling dust and fibrous decay welled up from the deep crevices beneath, and he wished he might discern the full history of the material. The contemplation turned him pensive after a while, so that he would have slipped from the seat had he not clutched instinctively at the smooth armrest. His right hand fell on one of the protruding seams, the contact seeming to steady him slightly. It was too much, however, for the brittle fragility of the aged hide, and a desiccated fragment flaked off under his grasp. Still half-absorbed, he continued to clutch it as his other hand seized a more solid area on the worn bolster."}

From the start, it caused worry because of the angles. shapes it usually showed. It claimed to be \"stackable\". But the practical people of the business city called it simply \"defective\".

It appears that on countless occasions, a thin, waxen container of irregular and warped aspect had been procured from the local purveyor, which was then exceedingly greasy and fragile. Its form bore the mark of a common design, and the household had recognised it as the most recent acquisition of a lamentable lineage well known to them, which had latterly been manufactured at a distant, nameless factory and stored alone at the rear of a cluttered shelf. The container was a misshapen vessel of known utility but great perversity, and had from its inception excited consternation through the strange angles and odd geometries it was in the habit of exhibiting. It declared itself \u201cstackable\u201d, but the practical folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed it as merely \u201cdefective\u201d. Never aligning properly with its kind, it had dropped gradually from culinary service, and was now used only by a small group of desperate souls in other dwellings.

He strated to notice the chair's unusual shape near the end of the financial quarter. Other furniture also bothered him mroe and more. He was gaining an instinctive understanding of its slight dips. He amazed his coworkers by understanding stress patterns and other signs of wear. These signs had escaped eveyrone else in the department. One afternoon, they talked about possible strange folds in the fabric. They discussed theoretical points of pressure or even breaks in its old surface. This surface connected it to many other places. These places were as far away as the warehouse where it came from. The tanneries across the ocean. They were even as incredibly distant as the barely imaginable cow creatures beyond the entire industrial supply chai.n His study of this situation made everyone feel uncomfortable. Some of his imagined explanations caused more gossip about his careful and lonely ways. The clerks shook their heads because of his serious theory. He believed a man couldchoose to leave the ordinary world. He could go to any other state of being. This state might exist at one of countless specific points in the leather's surface pattern.\n###\nToward the end of the fiscal quarter he began to notice the chair\u2019s peculiar contours, though other furnishings vexed him increasingly. He was acquiring an intuitive grasp of its subtle depressions, and astonished his colleagues by his comprehension of stress patterns and other wear-marks which had eluded all the rest of the department. One afternoon there was a discussion of possible anomalous creases in the upholstery, and of theoretical points of strain or even rupture in its aged surface connecting it to various other realms as distant as the warehouse of its origin or the trans-oceanic tanneries themselves\u2014or even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable bovine entities beyond the whole industrial supply-chain continuum. His analysis of this condition filled everyone with unease, even though some of his hypothetical reconstructions caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his fastidious and solitary habits. What made the clerks shake their heads was his earnest theory that a man might\u2014given tactile sensitivity admittedly beyond all likelihood of ordinary perception\u2014descend deliberately from the realm of the mundane to any other state of being which might lie at one of an infinity of specific points in the grain\u2019s topography."}

Its design was very similar to the original wallpaper. Its colors showed relatively litlte clash because of the exact plant-based parts used in the printing process. The slowly growing stains became very large and uniquely complex. They were seen as changing and becoming darker with amazing steadiness. They seemed to communicate with the wall by copying its texture. It was a kind of thread-like bleeding over a wide area, if the landlord's check was correct. They spread more from hidden wetness than from sun exposure, unlike in earlier times. They were, however, kept within acceptable limits. The pale colors reflected light very poroly. They certainly made up for the loss of the familiar bright flower colors of the old wallpaper.\n###\nAt last a faded pattern emerged upon the surface of that ancient plaster; its design much like that of the original paper, and its coloration displaying relatively little discord because of the precise botanical element inherent in the printing operations. The slowly spreading stains grew to enormous size and singular complexity, and were represented as shifting and deepening with marvellous persistence. They seemed to commune with the foundation by mimicking its texture\u2014a sort of fibrous bleeding over a wide area, if the landlord\u2019s inspection had indicated aright\u2014and to spread more from hidden dampness than from solar exposure as in earlier times. They were, however, kept in tolerable containment. The pallid pigments reflected light with dismal effectiveness, and doubtless atoned for the loss of the familiar floral brilliance of the bygone installation."}

We were grabbed for a moment by a fear. It was than our reasoned fears about those others. came a letdown. The shape moved into a side archway to our left. It joined two others of its kind. They had called it in tones. For it was a penguin. But it was of a, kind. It was than the known king penguins. It was in its combined whiteness and near eyelessness. We followed it into the archwa.y We turned btoh torches on the group of three. We saw they were all penguins of the kind. Their size reminded us of some penguins shown in the Old Ones ' carvings. We decided they came from the line. They survived by retreating to a area. Its darkness destroyed their color and shrank their eyes to slits. That their home was the abyss we sought was not for a moemnt. This proof of the gulf 's warmth. Livability filled us with. disturbing thoughts. We wondered what made these three birds leave their area. Silence of the city showed it was a place. The indifference of the three to us made it seme that any passing group of those others would have scared them. Was it those others took some action or tired to get meat? We doubted whether that smell the dogs hated could cause dislike in these penguins. Their ancestors had lived with the Old Ones. This relationship must have lasted in the abyss as any Old Ones remained. We felt regret, in a return of the science spirit, that we could not photograph these creatures. We left them to their squawking. We pushed on toward the abyss. Its opennses was proven to us. penguin tracks showed its direction.\n###\nBut to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an instant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others. Then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguin\u2014albeit of a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessness. When we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three we saw that they were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species. Their size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the Old Ones\u2019 sculptures, and it did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stock\u2014undoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless slits. That their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought, was not for a moment to be doubted; and this evidence of the gulf\u2019s continued warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing fancies. We wondered, too, what had caused these three birds to venture out of their usual domain. The state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery, whilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled them. Was it possible that those others had taken some aggressive action or tried to increase their meat supply? We doubted whether that pungent odour which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins; since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms with the Old Ones\u2014an amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long as any of the Old Ones remained. Regretting\u2014in a flareup of the old spirit of pure science\u2014that we could not photograph these anomalous creatures, we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us, and whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clear."}

It is noted that West had a bad argument with Dr. Halsey near the end of his last college term. The argument was long and did not make him look good. The kind dean was more polite. It is observed that he felt his important work was being stopped for no good reason. He could do the work later in life. But he wnated to start it while he still had the university's special resources. The older professors, who follow tradition, ignored his unique results with animals. They kept syaing reanimation was impossible. This was upsetting. Hard for a young man of West's logical nature to understand. It becomes clear that only greater maturity could help one understand the permanent mental limits of the \"professor-doctor\" type. They are the result of many generations of sad Puritanism. They are kind, careful, and sometimes gentle and friendly. But they are also always narrow-minded, intolerant, bound by custom, and lack a broad view. Age is known to be more forgiving of these flawed but noble people. Their worst real fault is being timid. They are finally punished by public laughter for their intellectual mistakes. Tehse mistakes include Ptolemaism, Calvinism, being against Darwinism, being agianst Nietzscheism. All kinds of Sabbatarianism. Laws about spending. West was young, even though he had great scientific knowledge. It can be seen that he had little patience with good Dr. Halsey and his learned colleagues. He felt more and more resentment. He also wanted to prove his theories to these stubborn important people in a dramatic way. As often happens with young people, he had detailed daydreams about revenge, winning. Finally generously forgiving them.\n###\nWest clashed disagreeably with Dr. Halsey near the end of our last undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the kindly dean in point of courtesy. He felt that he was needlessly and irrationally retarded in a supremely great work; a work which he could of course conduct to suit himself in later years, but which he wished to begin while still possessed of the exceptional facilities of the university. That the tradition-bound elders should ignore his singular results on animals, and persist in their denial of the possibility of reanimation, was inexpressibly disgusting and almost incomprehensible to a youth of West\u2019s logical temperament. Only greater maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the \u201cprofessor-doctor\u201d type\u2014the product of generations of pathetic Puritanism; kindly, conscientious, and sometimes gentle and amiable, yet always narrow, intolerant, custom-ridden, and lacking in perspective. Age has more charity for these incomplete yet high-souled characters, whose worst real vice is timidity, and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sins\u2014sins like Ptolemaism, Calvinism, anti-Darwinism, anti-Nietzscheism, and every sort of Sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation. West, young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good Dr. Halsey and his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion. Like most youths, he indulged in elaborate day-dreams of revenge, triumph, and final magnanimous forgiveness."}

They now knew some awful part of the camp horrors must have entered this ancient dark burial place. So they could no longer doubt that unknown things were ahead, now or recently.

He did not like the idea of going back to the underground world of the giants. He did not want to risk that terrible tower with its countless steps leading to the magic [THING] again. But he felt he might have to try this if nothing else worked. He did not dare to cross the high plain past the lonely temple without help. The high priest 's messengers would be many. At the end of the journey, there would surely be the flying creatures. Maybe other things to face. If he could get a boat, he might sail back to the [THING] past the sharp. Ugly [THING] in the [THING]. The old paintings in the temple maze showed that this frightening place is not far from the [THING] docks of the port [THING]. But finding a boat in this long - deserted [THING] was not likely. It also did not seem possible that he could ever build one. These were his thoughts wehn a new feeling began to press on his mind. All this time, the great dead width of the fabled [THING] had stretched before him. It had its black broken pillars and crumbling gates topped with statues. It had giant stones. Monstrous winged lions against the sick glow of the shining night clouds. Now he saw far ahead. To the right a glow that the clouds could not cause. He knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead [THING]. The glow rose and fell irregularly. It flickered with a greenish color that did not make the watcher feel safe. When he cretp closer, down the messy [THING]. Through some narrow gaps between fallen walls, he saw it was a campfire near the docks. Many unclear shapes were gathered darkly around it. A deadly smell hung heavily over everything. Beyond was the oily sound of the harbor [THING]. A large ship was riding at anchor. He stopped in pure terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the feared black ships from the [THING]. Then, just as he was about to creep back from that hateful flame, he saw movement among the vague dark shapes. He haerd a special and clear sound. It was the frightened cry of a ghoul. In a moment, it had grown into a real chorus of pain. Safe as he was in the shadow of the monstrous ruins, he let his curiosity overcome his fear. He crept forward again instead of going back.\n###\nHe did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of Koth with its Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood, yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed. Over Leng\u2019s plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided; for the high-priest\u2019s emissaries must be many, while at the journey\u2019s end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with. If he could get a boat he might sail back to Inganok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea, for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from Sarkomand\u2019s basalt quays. But to find a boat in this aeon-deserted city was no probable thing, and it did not appear likely that he could ever make one. Such were the thoughts of Randolph Carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind. All this while there had stretched before him the great corpse-like width of fabled Sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds. Now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for, and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city. The glow rose and fell fitfully, flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher. And when he crept closer, down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls, he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it, and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all. Beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor, and Carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moon. Then, just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame, he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound. It was the frightened meeping of a ghoul, and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins, Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear, and crept forward again instead of retreating."}

They joined by a low pass. The stars shone weakly through it. We watched this opening vrey carfeully. We knew we might see the lower parts of the huge thing against the sky byeond it. That thing was flying with a wave-like motion above the mountain peaks. The object had now moved a little ahead. Every eye in our group was fixed on the opening. We expected to soon see its full silhouette there. Gradually the huge thing aobve the peaks came near the opening. It slowed its speed a little, as if it knew it had gone ahead of the ghoul army. For another minute the tension was high. Then came the brief moment of full silhouette and revelation. It brought to the ghouls' lips an awed and half-choked sound of cosmic fear. It brought to our souls as travelers a chill that has never fully left us. For the huge bobbing shape that rose above the ridge was only a head. It was a pointed double head. Below it, in terrible size, moved the frightful sowllen body that carried it. It was a monstrosity as high as a mountain. It walked in stealth and silence. It was a hyena-like distortion of a giant human-like shape. It trotted blackly against the sky. Its disgusting pair of cone-capped heads reached halfway to the top of the sky.\n###\nThen came a wide gap in the range, where the hideous reaches of transmontane Leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass through which the stars shone wanly. Carter watched this gap with intense care, knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles. The object had now floated ahead a trifle, and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in full-length silhouette. Gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the gap, slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the ghoulish army. For another minute suspense was keen, and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came; bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and half-choked meep of cosmic fear, and to the soul of the traveller a chill that has never wholly left it. For the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was only a head\u2014a mitred double head\u2014and below it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that bore it; the mountain-high monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence; the hyaena-like distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the sky, its repulsive pair of cone-capped heads reaching half way to the zenith."}

Lone, upset and shaken, grieved for the simple courtyards and lower walls. A heavy branch from a strange new tree had fallen directly on the grand main porch.

They found no sign of the gentle Musides or the wonderfully made statue of Tych\u00e9. In such huge ruin, only chaos remained. The representatives of two cities left disappointed. Amidst was sad because they had no statue to take home. Syracusans was sad because they had no artist to honor. However, it is clear that the Tegeans later got a very fine statue in Syracusans.

Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peristyle had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins. Strangers and Tegeans stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of Kalos.

Many separate facts about the movement that had become threatening were learned. This was done through quiet walks, careful casual talks, well-timed offers of pocket liquor. Wise talks with scared prisoners. The new people were indeed Kurds. They sopke a dialect that was unclear. Hard for language experts to understand. Those who worked mostly did jobs as dock workers and unlicensed street sellers. They also often worked in Greek restaurants and ran corner news stands. However, most of them had no clear way to earn money. They were clearly linked to criminal activities. Smuggling and \"bootlegging\" were the least bad of thes.e It is noted that they arrived on steamships, which seemed to be tramp freighters. They wree unloaded secretly on nights with no moon. They used rowboats that went under a certain wharf. Then followed a hidden canal to a secret underground pool under a house. This wharf, canal, and house could not be found. The memories of the people who told about them were very mixed up. Also, their speech was mostly too hard for even the best interpreters. Also, no real information on why they were being brought in systematically could be gained. They did not want to say exactly where they came from. They were never careless enough to show who had found them and guided them. In fact, they showed something like sharp fear when asked why they were there. Gangsters of other types were also very quiet. The most that could be learned was that some god. Great priesthood had promised them unbelievable powers. Rule in a strange land.\n###\nPolice methods are varied and ingenious. Malone, through unostentatious rambles, carefully casual conversations, well-timed offers of hip-pocket liquor, and judicious dialogues with frightened prisoners, learned many isolated facts about the movement whose aspect had become so menacing. The newcomers were indeed Kurds, but of a dialect obscure and puzzling to exact philology. Such of them as worked lived mostly as dock-hands and unlicenced pedlars, though frequently serving in Greek restaurants and tending corner news stands. Most of them, however, had no visible means of support; and were obviously connected with underworld pursuits, of which smuggling and \u201cbootlegging\u201d were the least indescribable. They had come in steamships, apparently tramp freighters, and had been unloaded by stealth on moonless nights in rowboats which stole under a certain wharf and followed a hidden canal to a secret subterranean pool beneath a house. This wharf, canal, and house Malone could not locate, for the memories of his informants were exceedingly confused, while their speech was to a great extent beyond even the ablest interpreters; nor could he gain any real data on the reasons for their systematic importation. They were reticent about the exact spot from which they had come, and were never sufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies which had sought them out and directed their course. Indeed, they developed something like acute fright when asked the reasons for their presence. Gangsters of other breeds were equally taciturn, and the most that could be gathered was that some god or great priesthood had promised them unheard-of powers and supernatural glories and rulerships in a strange land."}

One must not, for example, linger much around the Marsh refinery, or around any of the still used churches, or around the pillared Order of Dagon Hall at New Church Green. Those churches were very odd\u2014all violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere, and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments. Their creeds were heterodox and mysterious, involving hints of certain marvellous transformations leading to bodily immortality\u2014of a sort\u2014on this earth. The youth\u2019s own pastor\u2014Dr. Wallace of Asbury M. E. Church in Arkham\u2014had gravely urged him not to join any church in Innsmouth."}

Off since they first saw the valley. The nameless city under a moon. Despite one's tiredness, one frantically sits up. Stares back along the black corridor toward the tunnels leading to the outer world. The feelings are much like those that would make one avoid the nameless city at night. They are as to explain as they are strong. A moment latre, a greater shock is received from a clear sound. It was the first sound to break the complete silence of those tomb-like depths. It was a moan, like a distant crowd of condemned spirits. It came from the direction one was looking. Its sound quickly grew louder. Soon it echoed terribly through the passage. At the same time, one notices a growing draft of air. It also flows from the tunnels and the city above. The touch of this air seems to steady one.

My sensations were much like those which had made me shun the nameless city at night, and were as inexplicable as they were poignant. In another moment, however, I received a still greater shock in the form of a definite sound\u2014the first which had broken the utter silence of these tomb-like depths. It was a deep, low moaning, as of a distant throng of condemned spirits, and came from the direction in which I was staring. Its volume rapidly grew, till soon it reverberated frightfully through the low passage, and at the same time I became conscious of an increasing draught of cold air, likewise flowing from the tunnels and the city above. The touch of this air seemed to restore my balance, for I instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the abyss each sunset and sunrise, one of which had indeed served to reveal the hidden tunnels to me. I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near, so braced myself to resist the gale which was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening. My fear again waned low, since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the unknown."}

He looked at its few boosk. There was an eighteenth-century Bible, a Pilgrim's Progress from the same time. It had woodcut pictures and was printed by the almanac maker Isaiah Thomas. There was the rotting bulk of Cotton Mather's Maganlia Christi Americana. A few other books of about the same age. Then his attention was caught by the clear sound of someone wakling in the room above. At first he was surprised and alarmed, because no one had answered his earlier knock. Then he thought the person must have just woken up from sleep. He listened with less surprise as footsteps came down the creaking stairs. The steps were heav,y but also seemed cautious. He disliked this cautious quality more because the steps were heavy. When he entered the room, he had closed the door behind him. Now, after a moment of silence, the walker might have been looking at his bicycle in the hall. He heard someone fumbling with the latch.

At first astonished and startled, considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door, I immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from a sound sleep; and listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded on the creaking stairs. The tread was heavy, yet seemed to contain a curious quality of cautiousness; a quality which I disliked the more because the tread was heavy.

On the third morning, I saw the meter was very low. Ready to take coins quickly. The device's control was frustrating. But I had more important duties to worry about. I did not mind this small extra cost. I bravely started driving toward an unfamiliar city area. I drove west all day. I was guiedd by a distant open space. This space looked less crowded than any other empty spot on the wide road. That evening, I stopped the car. The next day, I kept traveling toward that space. Yet it semeed almost as hard to reach as when I first saw it. By the fourth hour, I recahed the curb next to the sign. The sign was much stricter than it seemed from far away. A nearby notice listed its harsh rules clearly. It stood out from the general city laws. I was too tired to argue. I gave in to the authority's shadow.\n###\nOn the third morning I found the meter hungry enough to devour coins with avidity. The tyranny of the device was maddening; but I was too much concerned with graver obligations to mind so slight an extortion, and set out boldly for an unknown municipal zone. All day I drove steadily westward, guided by a far-away space which seemed less congested than any other vacancy on the rolling asphalt. That evening I parked, and on the following day still journeyed toward that space, though that object seemed scarcely more attainable than when I had first espied it. By the fourth hour I attained the curb beside the marker, which turned out to be much more exacting than it had appeared from a distance; an adjacent placard setting forth its dire regulations in sharper relief from the general ordnance. Too weary to contest, I submitted to the shadow of the authority."}

He had requirements for beauty, accomplishments, and standing., his search focused on the family of one of his. ship captains. This captain was a widower of birth and reputation named Dutee Tillinghast. His daughter, Eliza, seemed to have every advantage. The thing she lacked was the prospect of bieng an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was controlled by Curwen. After a meeting in his cupolaed house on Power 's Lane hill, Curwen agreed to allow the marriage. Eliza Tillinghast was eighteen years at that time. She had been raised as her father 's circumstances allowed. She had attended Stephen Jackson 's school opposite the Court - House Parade. Her mother had taught her all the arts. Refinements of life before the mother died of smallpox in 1757. A sampler she worked on in 1753, at age nine, can be seen in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mother 's death, she managed the house. She was helped by one woman. Her arguments with her father about the proposed Curwen marriage must have been., we have no record of these arguments. it is that her engagement to Ezra Weeden was ended. Ezra Weeden was mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise. Her marriage to Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763. It was in the church. One of the groups the town could offer was. The ceremony was performed by the Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event. In surviving copies, the item seems to be cut out or torn out. Ward found a copy after searching. He searched in the archives of a collector. He observed with amusement the politeness of the language. It remarked: \" Monday evening, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a Lady who has Merit, added to a Person, to grace the State. Perpetuate its Felicity. \" The collection of Durfee - Arnold letters was discovered by Charles Ward. He discovered them before his reported madness. They were in the collection of Melivlle F. Peters, Esq., of George St.. The letters cover this period and a time. They provide a picture of the outrage caused by this matched marriage.\n###\nSuch candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Power\u2019s Lane hill, to sanction the blasphemous alliance. Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended Stephen Jackson\u2019s school opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been diligently instructed by her mother, before the latter\u2019s death of smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mother\u2019s death she had kept the house, aided only by one old black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language: \u201cMonday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\u201d The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match."}

A pair of newspaper clippings made this feeling. The clippings were about deaths in the shunned house. They came from times. One was from the Providence Gazette and Country - Journal of April 12, 1815. The was from the Daily Transcript and Chronicle of October 27, 1845. Each described a detail. The fact that it was repeated was. It seems that in both cases the dying person became transformed in a way. In 1815 it was a lady named Stafford. In 1845 it was a - school - teacher named Eleazar Durfee. They stared with glassy eyes. They tried to bite the throat of the attending doctor.,, was the case. This case ended the renting of the house. It was a series of anemia deaths. These came after growing madnesses. In these, the patient would try to kill his relatives. He would make cuts in the neck or wrist. This was in 1860 and 1861. My uncle had started his pracitce. Before leaving for the war front, he heard about it from his doctor colleagues. The thing was the way the victims would speak curses in French. They were people. The - smelling and avoided house could be rented to no one. They could not have studied this language. It made one think of Rhoby Harris a hundred years. It affected my uncle that he beagn gathering facts about the house. He did this after listening to the - hand account of Drs. This was some time after he returned from the war. Chase and Whitmarsh were involved., I could see that my uncle had thought about the subject. He was of my interest. It was an - and understanding interest. It let him discuss with me matters that would make others laugh. His imagination had not gone as mine. But he felt the place was in its possibilities for the imagination. It was of note as an inspiration in the area of the strange. For my part, I was to take the subject with seriousness. I began at not to look over the evidence. To gather as I could. I spoke with the Archer Harris. He was the owner of the house. We talked times before his death in 1916. I got from him. His living sister Alice a confirmation of all the family facts my uncle had collected.\n###\nFree from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced in me an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house\u2014one from the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal of April 12, 1815, and the other from the Daily Transcript and Chronicle of October 27, 1845\u2014each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose duplication was remarkable. It seems that in both instances the dying person, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and in 1845 a school-teacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured in a horrible way; glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of the attending physician. Even more puzzling, though, was the final case which put an end to the renting of the house\u2014a series of anaemia deaths preceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would craftily attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wrist. This was in 1860 and 1861, when my uncle had just begun his medical practice; and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his elder professional colleagues. The really inexplicable thing was the way in which the victims\u2014ignorant people, for the ill-smelling and widely shunned house could now be rented to no others\u2014would babble maledictions in French, a language they could not possibly have studied to any extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby Harris nearly a century before, and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting historical data on the house after listening, some time subsequent to his return from the war, to the first-hand account of Drs. Chase and Whitmarsh. Indeed, I could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject, and that he was glad of my own interest\u2014an open-minded and sympathetic interest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which others would merely have laughed. His fancy had not gone so far as mine, but he felt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities, and worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and macabre. For my part, I was disposed to take the whole subject with profound seriousness, and began at once not only to review the evidence, but to accumulate as much more as I could. I talked with the elderly Archer Harris, then owner of the house, many times before his death in 1916; and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister Alice an authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected."}

The proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a queer way impossible to describe, while its face had taken on an expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before. The boys were genuinely frightened, and threw the thing away at once, so that only their grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside. But the shying of the horses near Nahum\u2019s house had now become an acknowledged thing, and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend was fast taking form.

They wantde to avoid using their limited equipment when not needed. But in this situation, they had no other option. They did not go down very deep. After a few hours, the sea became calmer.

Still, as I saw Dr. Mu\u00f1oz in that blast of cool air, I felt a dislike that nothing in his looks could explain. Only his somewhat pale skin. Cold touch could have provided a physical reason for this feeling. Even these things should have been excusable given the [THING] 's known illness. It might also have been the unusual cold that put me off. Such chill was abnormal on such a hot dya. The abnormal always causes dislike, distrust, and fear. But dislike was soon forgotten in admiration. The strange doctor 's great skill became clear at once. This was despite the ice - cold and shaky look of his bloodless hands. He clearly understood my needs at a glance. He treated them with a master 's skill. Meanwhile, he reassured me in a finely controlled but oddly hollow and toneless voice. He said he was the bitterest sworn enemy of death. He had spent his fortune. Lost all his friends in a lifetime of strnage experiments. These were devoted to defeating and destroying death. A Something of the kind but obsessed fanatic seemed to live in him. He talked on almost too much as he checked my chest. He mixed a suitable [THING] of drugs fetched from the smaller lab [THING]. Evidently he found the company of a well - born [THING] a rare treat in this dirty setting. Memories of better days moved him to unusual speech. His voice, if odd, was at least calming. I could not even tell that he breathed as the smooth sentences came out politely.\n###\nI now saw that the hall room above mine\u2014the \u201cleetle room\u201d of bottles and machines which Mrs. Herrero had mentioned\u2014was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination. The figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned, and clad in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit. A high-bred face of masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short iron-grey full beard, and an old-fashioned pince-nez shielded the full, dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise dominantly Celtiberian. Thick, well-trimmed hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breeding. Nevertheless, as I saw Dr. Mu\u00f1oz in that blast of cool air, I felt a repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify. Only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have been excusable considering the man\u2019s known invalidism. It might, too, have been the singular cold that alienated me; for such chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day, and the abnormal always excites aversion, distrust, and fear. But repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician\u2019s extreme skill at once became manifest despite the ice-coldness and shakiness of his bloodless-looking hands. He clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master\u2019s deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation. Something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him, and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory room. Evidently he found the society of a well-born man a rare novelty in this dingy environment, and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over him. His voice, if queer, was at least soothing; and I could not even perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out."}

With one burst of strength that tore muscle from muscle, it sent its body struggling to the floor in a state of jelly - falling. The staring body that had been Robert Suydam reached its goal and its victory. The push had been. But the force had lasted. As the pusher fell into a spot of decay, the stand he had pushed shook, leaned. fell from its onyx base into the waters. It sent up a flash of carved gold as it sank to places of Tartarus. At that moment, the scene of horror disappeared to nothing before Malone 's eyes. He fainted during a crash that seemed to erase all the universe. Malone 's dream happened before he knew of Suydam 's death and transfer at sea. It was added to by some realities of the case. But that is no reason for anyone to believe it. The three houses in Parker Place, with decay in its hidden form, fell without cause.

For he was, as no one wants to deny. They found him by the edge of a night - pool. A mix of decay and bone was a feet. It was identified through work as the body of Suydam. The case was. The smugglers ' canal led. The men who took Suydam from the ship had brought him. They themselves were found, or at identified. The ship 's doctor is not with the certainties of the police. Suydam was a leader in man - smuggling operations. The canal to his house was one of channels. Tunnels in the area. There was a tunnel from this house to a room beneath the dance - hall church. This room was from church through a passage in the north wall. In its rooms some and things were discovered.\n###\nBut they were too late, for in one final spurt of strength which ripped tendon from tendon and sent its noisome bulk floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish dissolution, the staring corpse which had been Robert Suydam achieved its object and its triumph. The push had been tremendous, but the force had held out; and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy blotch of corruption the pedestal he had pushed tottered, tipped, and finally careened from its onyx base into the thick waters below, sending up a parting gleam of carven gold as it sank heavily to undreamable gulfs of lower Tartarus. In that instant, too, the whole scene of horror faded to nothingness before Malone\u2019s eyes; and he fainted amidst a thunderous crash which seemed to blot out all the evil universe. Malone\u2019s dream, experienced in full before he knew of Suydam\u2019s death and transfer at sea, was curiously supplemented by some odd realities of the case; though that is no reason why anyone should believe it. The three old houses in Parker Place, doubtless long rotten with decay in its most insidious form, collapsed without visible cause while half the raiders and most of the prisoners were inside; and of both the greater number were instantly killed. Only in the basements and cellars was there much saving of life, and Malone was lucky to have been deep below the house of Robert Suydam. For he really was there, as no one is disposed to deny. They found him unconscious by the edge of a night-black pool, with a grotesquely horrible jumble of decay and bone, identifiable through dental work as the body of Suydam, a few feet away. The case was plain, for it was hither that the smugglers\u2019 underground canal led; and the men who took Suydam from the ship had brought him home. They themselves were never found, or at least never identified; and the ship\u2019s doctor is not yet satisfied with the simple certitudes of the police. Suydam was evidently a leader in extensive man-smuggling operations, for the canal to his house was but one of several subterranean channels and tunnels in the neighbourhood. There was a tunnel from this house to a crypt beneath the dance-hall church; a crypt accessible from the church only through a narrow secret passage in the north wall, and in whose chambers some singular and terrible things were discovered."}

We will never know what What Malone would have found if he colud have worked on the case without stopping. A foolish dispute between ctiy and Federal authorities stopped the investigations for several months. During that time, the detective was busy with other tasks. But he never lost interest. He was always amazed by what started to happen to Robert Sudyam. Just when a wave of kidnappings. Disappearances caused excitement across Modern York, the messy scholar began a change that was both shocking. One day, people saw him near Borough Hall with a clean-shaved face, neat hair. Very clean, nice clothes. Every day after that, people noticed small improvements in him. He kept his new neat appearance without stopping. He also gained a new brightness in his eyes and clearness in his speech. Slowly, he began to lose the extra weight that had long made him look bad. People often thought he was younger than his age. He gained a spring in his step. cheerful manner that matched his new style. His hair also seemed to get darker, but it did not look like dye. As months passed, he started to dress in less cnoservative ways. Finally, he surprised his new friends by fixing up and decorating his Flatbush mansion. He hedl a sreies of parties there. He invited all the people he could remember. He especially welcomed the relatives who had recently tried to hvae him restrained. Whom he had now fully forgiven. Some people came out of curiosity. Others cmae out of duty. But everyone was suddenly charmed by the growing grace and politeness of the former hermit. He said he had finished most of the work he was meant to do. He had just inherited some property from a half-forgotten European friend. He said he planned to spend his remaining years in a happier second youth. This was made possible by ease, care, and diet. He was seen less and less at Red Hook. More and more, he was seen moving in the high society he was born into. Policemen noted that gangsters tended to gather at the old stone church and dance-hall. They did this instead of going to the basement flat in Parker Place. However, that flat and its recent additions were still full of harmful activity.\n###\nWhat Malone would have unearthed could he have worked continuously on the case, we shall never know. As it was, a stupid conflict between city and Federal authority suspended the investigations for several months, during which the detective was busy with other assignments. But at no time did he lose interest, or fail to stand amazed at what began to happen to Robert Suydam. Just at the time when a wave of kidnappings and disappearances spread its excitement over New York, the unkempt scholar embarked upon a metamorphosis as startling as it was absurd. One day he was seen near Borough Hall with clean-shaved face, well-trimmed hair, and tastefully immaculate attire, and on every day thereafter some obscure improvement was noticed in him. He maintained his new fastidiousness without interruption, added to it an unwonted sparkle of eye and crispness of speech, and began little by little to shed the corpulence which had so long deformed him. Now frequently taken for less than his age, he acquired an elasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanour to match the new tradition, and shewed a curious darkening of the hair which somehow did not suggest dye. As the months passed, he commenced to dress less and less conservatively, and finally astonished his new friends by renovating and redecorating his Flatbush mansion, which he threw open in a series of receptions, summoning all the acquaintances he could remember, and extending a special welcome to the fully forgiven relatives who had so lately sought his restraint. Some attended through curiosity, others through duty; but all were suddenly charmed by the dawning grace and urbanity of the former hermit. He had, he asserted, accomplished most of his allotted work; and having just inherited some property from a half-forgotten European friend, was about to spend his remaining years in a brighter second youth which ease, care, and diet had made possible to him. Less and less was he seen at Red Hook, and more and more did he move in the society to which he was born. Policemen noted a tendency of the gangsters to congregate at the old stone church and dance-hall instead of at the basement flat in Parker Place, though the latter and its recent annexes still overflowed with noxious life."}

Those men are the origin of gods. Those gods carved their faces on Ngranek. during the day, the galleon reached the parts of the river that go through the jungles of Kled. Carter wished he could get off the ship. In those jungles stand ivory palaces. They are and. kings lived. Their land 's name is forgotten. Spells of the Eledr Ones keep those places and not ruined.

Wooden ox - carts moved. merchants called out their goods in the markets.\n###\nOf other boundaries of Inganok those sailors had no notion, nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown Kadath save from vague unplaced report. And of the marvellous sunset city which Carter sought they knew nothing at all. So the traveller asked no more of far things, but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight Inganok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on Ngranek. Late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed jungles of Kled. Here Carter wished he might disembark, for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory, lone and unbroken, where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten. Spells of the Elder Ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed, for it is written that there may one day be need of them again; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight, though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due. But the ship swept on, and dusk hushed the hum of the day, and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind, leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had been. And all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected. Once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east, but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much, since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit them. In the morning the river had broadened out greatly, and Carter saw by the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of Hlanith on the Cerenerian Sea. Here the walls are of rugged granite, and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables. The men of Hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland; so that the city is not sought except for barter, but is prized for the solid work of its artisans. The wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox-carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars."}

In April, the country people acted strangely. They stopped using the road past Nahum's house. This led to road being left empty later. The plants were the reason. All the fruit trees bloomed in odd colors. In the yard's rocky soil and the nearby field, strange plants grew. Only a plant expert could link them to normal local plants. No normal, healthy colors were seen except in the green grass and leaves. Everywhere else, there were wild, rainbow-like colors. These colors came from a sickly base color not found in nature. The Dutchman's breeches plant seemed threatening. The bloodroot plants showed bold, wrnog colors. Ammi and the Gardners thought most colors seemed strangely famliiar. They decided the colors reminded them of the fragile ball inside the meteor. Nahum plowed and planted the ten-acre field and the hill land. He did nothing with the land near the house. He knew it would not help. He hoped the summer's strange plants would pull all the poison from the soil. He was ready for almost anything now. He had become used to feeling something near, waiting to be heard. The neighbors avoiding his house affected him. It affected his wife more. The boys were better off because they went to school each day. But they could not avoid being scared by the tal.k Thaddeus, a very sensitive boy, suffered the most.\n###\nApril brought a kind of madness to the country folk, and began that disuse of the road past Nahum\u2019s which led to its ultimate abandonment. It was the vegetation. All the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth. The Dutchman\u2019s breeches became a thing of sinister menace, and the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the Gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity, and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor. Nahum ploughed and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the upland lot, but did nothing with the land around the house. He knew it would be of no use, and hoped that the summer\u2019s strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for almost anything now, and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to be heard. The shunning of his house by neighbours told on him, of course; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being at school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the gossip. Thaddeus, an especially sensitive youth, suffered the most."}

But this time, the pillars reached up into an airy [THING] of light. It sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column I had seen before. After that, the scene was almost copmletely like a kaleidoscope. In the mix of sights, sounds. Uknnown sense impressions, I felt I was about to dissolve. I felt I would lose my solid form in some way. I will always remember one clear flash. For a moment, I seemed to see a patch of strange night [THING]. It was filled with shining, turning spheres. As it moved away, I saw the glowing suns formed a constellation. Galaxy of fixed shape. This shape was the twisted [THING] of Crawford Tillinghast. At another time, I felt huge, living things brushing past me. They sometimes walked or drifted through my supposedly solid [THING]. I thought I saw Tillinghast look at them. It was as if his better - trained senses could see them visually. I remembered what he had siad about the pineal gland. I wondered what he saw with this supernatural [THING]. Then I myself gained a kind of improved sight. Out of and above the glowing and shadowy mess, a picture arose. It was vague but had elements of consistency and permanence. It was somewhat familiar. The unusual part was placed over the usual earthly scene. It was like a movie being shown on a painted theater curtain. I saw the attic laboratory. I saw the electrical [THING]. I saw the ugly form of Tillinghast across from me. But all the space not filled by known material objects was completely full. Indescribable shapes, both living and not, were mixed in disgusting disorder. Close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien, unknown beings. It also semeed all the known things were part of other unknown things. The reverse was also true. Among the living objects were great, black, jelly - like monsters. They quivered softly in time with the vibrations from the [THING]. They were present in hateful large numbers. I saw to my horror that they overlapped. They were semi - fluid. They could pass through each other and through what we know as solids. These things were never still. They seemed to always float around with some evil purpose. Sometimes they appaered to eat each other. The attcaker would throw itself at its victim. It would instantly wipe the victim from sight.\n###\nThen I glimpsed the temple-like effect again, but this time the pillars reached up into an a\u00ebrial ocean of light, which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column I had seen before. After that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic, and in the jumble of sights, sounds, and unidentified sense-impressions I felt that I was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form. One definite flash I shall always remember. I seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining, revolving spheres, and as it receded I saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape; this shape being the distorted face of Crawford Tillinghast. At another time I felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body, and thought I saw Tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually. I recalled what he had said of the pineal gland, and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eye. Suddenly I myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight. Over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which, though vague, held the elements of consistency and permanence. It was indeed somewhat familiar, for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theatre. I saw the attic laboratory, the electrical machine, and the unsightly form of Tillinghast opposite me; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar material objects not one particle was vacant. Indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray, and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien, unknown entities. It likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things, and vice versa. Foremost among the living objects were great inky, jellyish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine. They were present in loathsome profusion, and I saw to my horror that they overlapped; that they were semi-fluid and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids. These things were never still, but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose. Sometimes they appeared to devour one another, the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight."}

He was stopped in the hallway. He was told that someone wanted to see him. Wanted his company. He played music. He was seen as a small, thin, bent person. He wore shabby clothes. He had blue eyes and a strange, satyr-like face. His head was nearly bald. At first, he seemed both angry and scared. However, the clear friendliness shown finally softened him. He reluctantly signaled for one to follow him up the dark, creaking. Unstable attci stairs. His room was one of only two in the steeply sloped garret. It was on the west side, facing the high wall that marked the top of the street. The room was very large. It seemed even larger because it was extremely bare and neglected. The furniture included only a narrow iron bed, a dirty washstand, a small table, a large bookcase, an iron music-stand. Three old-fashioned chairs. Sheets of music were piled messily on the floor.

He was a small, lean, bent person, with shabby clothes, blue eyes, grotesque, satyr-like face, and nearly bald head; and at my first words seemed both angered and frightened. My obvious friendliness, however, finally melted him; and he grudgingly motioned to me to follow him up the dark, creaking, and rickety attic stairs. His room, one of only two in the steeply pitched garret, was on the west side, toward the high wall that formed the upper end of the street. Its size was very great, and seemed the greater because of its extraordinary bareness and neglect. Of furniture there was only a narrow iron bedstead, a dingy washstand, a small table, a large bookcase, an iron music-rack, and three old-fashioned chairs. Sheets of music were piled in disorder about the floor. The walls were of bare boards, and had probably never known plaster; whilst the abundance of dust and cobwebs made the place seem more deserted than inhabited.

One would look dreamily at the spread-out west view. One would see the towers of Memorial Hall just below. One would see the Georgian courthouse belrfy. One would see the tall pinnacles of the downtown area. One would see that shimmering, spire-topped mound in the distance. Its unknown streets and complex gables strongly excited the imagination. From a few local people one knew, it was learned the far slope was a Italian neighborhood. But most houses were leftovers from older Yankee and Irish times. Sometimes the field glasses would be aimed at that ghostly, unreachable world beyond the curling smoke. Individual roofs, chimneys, and steeples would be picked out. One would wonder about the and curious mystereis they mgiht contain. Even with the glasses, Federal Hill seemed somehow foreign, almost mythical.

Before this, Ward had been happy TO let his interest in old Joseph Curwen stay as just a passing thought. After learningg about his own connection to thiis seemingly \"hidden\" person, HE started to search for information about him in a very organized way. In this eager search, he eended up finding much more than he ever hoped. Old letters, diaries. Stacks of unpublished memories found in dusty Provvidence attics. Other places gave many clear details that the writers had not bothered to destroy. One key piece of information came from as farr away as New York, where some old Rhode Island colonial letters were kept in the Museum at Fraunces' Tavern. However, the most important thing, and what Dr. Willett believed was the clear cause of Ward's ruin, was the material found in August 1919 behidn the wall panels of the falling-down house in Olney Court. That discovery, without doubt,, opened up those dark views that ended in a place deeper than any pit.\n###\nBefore this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \u201chushed-up\u201d character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces\u2019 Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willett\u2019s opinion formed the definite source of Ward\u2019s undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit."}

The end of Herbert West started one night in their shared study. He was looking at the newspaper and the observer. A strange headline in the crumpled paper caught his attention. It felt like a giant claw reached down from sixteen years ago. Something very scary and hard to believe happened at Sefton Asylum, fifty miles away. It shocked the local area and confused the police. Very early in the morning, a group of quiet men entered the property. Their leader woke up the staff. He was a threatening military man. He spoke without moving his lips. His voice seemed to come from a large black case he carried. His face showed no expression and was very handsome, almost glowing. But it shocked the superintendent when the hall light shone on it. It was a wax face with painted glass eyes. Some unknown accident had happened to this man. A bigger man giuded his steps. This man was a disgusting large person. His bluish face looked half eaten by some unknown sickness. The speaker asked for the cannibal monster who was sent from Arkham sixteen years earlier. When they refused him, he gave a signal. This started a shocking riot. The evil men beat, stepped on. Bit every staff member who did not run away. They killed four people. They finally fered the monster. Those victims who could remember the event calmly said the creatures acted not like men. They acted like unthinkable robots controlled by the wax-faced leader. By the time help arrived, all signs of the men. Their crazy prisoner were gone.\n###\nThe end of Herbert West began one evening in our joint study when he was dividing his curious glance between the newspaper and me. A strange headline item had struck at him from the crumpled pages, and a nameless titan claw had seemed to reach down through sixteen years. Something fearsome and incredible had happened at Sefton Asylum fifty miles away, stunning the neighbourhood and baffling the police. In the small hours of the morning a body of silent men had entered the grounds and their leader had aroused the attendants. He was a menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice seemed almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried. His expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty, but had shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on it\u2014for it was a wax face with eyes of painted glass. Some nameless accident had befallen this man. A larger man guided his steps; a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half eaten away by some unknown malady. The speaker had asked for the custody of the cannibal monster committed from Arkham sixteen years before; and upon being refused, gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot. The fiends had beaten, trampled, and bitten every attendant who did not flee; killing four and finally succeeding in the liberation of the monster. Those victims who could recall the event without hysteria swore that the creatures had acted less like men than like unthinkable automata guided by the wax-faced leader. By the time help could be summoned, every trace of the men and of their mad charge had vanished."}

There, on a golden throne, sat a heavy figure dressed in yellow silk with red patterns. It had a yellow silk mask over its face. The slant-eyed man made certain hand signs to this being. The hidden being in the dark replied. It raised a disgustingly carved ivory flute in its silk-covered paws. It blew cetrain foul sounds from under its flowing yellow mask. This exchange went on for some time. To the observer, the sound of that flute. The smell of the stinking place felt sickeningly familiar. It brought to mind a frightening city lit in red. It brought to mind the disgusting parade that once moved through it. It brought to mind that. A terrible climb through moon-like countryside beyond, before the saving charge of Earth's friendly cats. It became clear that the creature on the platform was without doubt the high-priest not to be described. Legends whisper of such evil and abnormal possibilities about him. But one fears to thnik exactly what that hated high-priest might be.\n###\nThe slant-eyed merchant had now prodded Carter into a great domed space whose walls were carved in shocking bas-reliefs, and whose centre held a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring. There was no light in this vast and evil-smelling crypt, and the small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details only little by little. At the farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps; and there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a yellow silken mask over its face. To this being the slant-eyed man made certain signs with his hands, and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silk-covered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask. This colloquy went on for some time, and to Carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the malodorous place. It made him think of a frightful red-litten city and of the revolting procession that once filed through it; of that, and of an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond, before the rescuing rush of earth\u2019s friendly cats. He knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the high-priest not to be described, of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities, but he feared to think just what that abhorred high-priest might be."}

I did manage to hear the old muet [THING] play at night. At first, I walked quietly to my old fifth [THING]. Tehn I became brave enough to climb the last noisy stairs to the top attic. In the narrow hall, outside the locked [THING] with the covered keyhole, I often heard sounds. These sounds filled me with a fear I could not explain. It was a fear of strange wonder and deep mystery. The sounds were not ugly. But they had vibrations that seemed not of this [THING]. At times, they became like a symphony. I could hardly believe one player made them. Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius of wild power. As weeks passed, the playing grew wilder. The old musician looked more tired and secretive. It was sad to see. He now refused to let me in at any time. He avoided me when we met on the stairs. One night, I listened at the [THING]. I heard the screaming violin grow into a chaotic mix of sound. It was a noise that would make me doubt my own mind. But from behind the barred [THING] came a pitiful proof the horror was real. It was a terrible, wordless cry. Only a mute [THING] can make such a cry. It comes only in moments of great fear or pain. I knocked on the [THING] many times. There was no answer. Afterward I waited in dark hallway. I shook from cold and fear. Then I heard the poor musician weakly try to get up from the [THING] using a [THING]. Believing him just awake after fainting, I knocked again. At the same time, I called out my name to calm him. I heard Zann stumble to the [THING]. He closed both the shutter and the [THING]. Then he stumbled to the [THING]. He unlocked it with shaking hands to let me in. This time, his happiness at having me there was real. His twisted [THING] showed relief. He held onto my coat like a [THING] holding its mother 's skirt. Shaking in a sad way, the old [THING] pushed me into a [THING]. He sank into another [THING]. His violin and bow lay carelessly on the [THING] beside it. He sat without moving for some time. He nodded in a strange way. But he also seemed to be listening very hard and with fear.\n###\nWhat I did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man. At first I would tiptoe up to my old fifth floor, then I grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the peaked garret. There in the narrow hall, outside the bolted door with the covered keyhole, I often heard sounds which filled me with an indefinable dread\u2014the dread of vague wonder and brooding mystery. It was not that the sounds were hideous, for they were not; but that they held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth, and that at certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which I could hardly conceive as produced by one player. Certainly, Erich Zann was a genius of wild power. As the weeks passed, the playing grew wilder, whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold. He now refused to admit me at any time, and shunned me whenever we met on the stairs. Then one night as I listened at the door I heard the shrieking viol swell into a chaotic babel of sound; a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was real\u2014the awful, inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter, and which rises only in moments of the most terrible fear or anguish. I knocked repeatedly at the door, but received no response. Afterward I waited in the black hallway, shivering with cold and fear, till I heard the poor musician\u2019s feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair. Believing him just conscious after a fainting fit, I renewed my rapping, at the same time calling out my name reassuringly. I heard Zann stumble to the window and close both shutter and sash, then stumble to the door, which he falteringly unfastened to admit me. This time his delight at having me present was real; for his distorted face gleamed with relief while he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its mother\u2019s skirts. Shaking pathetically, the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank into another, beside which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the floor. He sat for some time inactive, nodding oddly, but having a paradoxical suggestion of intense and frightened listening."}

There was not, I soon decided, any reason why I should have felt that shuddering touch of evil pseudo-memory. Was it not natural that a local mystery cult should adopt among its regimentals an unique type of head-dress made familiar to the community in some strange way\u2014perhaps as treasure-trove? A very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalks\u2014lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three. The lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harboured small shops with dingy signs, and I noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along. The sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct, and presently I saw a fairly deep river-gorge ahead, spanned by a wide, iron-railed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out. As we clanked over the bridge I looked out on both sides and observed some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part way down. The water far below was very abundant, and I could see two vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least one downstream on my left. From this point the noise was quite deafening. Then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the right-hand side in front of a tall, cupola-crowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a half-effaced sign proclaiming it to be the Gilman House. I was glad to get out of that bus, and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby. There was only one person in sight\u2014an elderly man without what I had come to call the \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d\u2014and I decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me; remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel. Instead, I strolled out on the square, from which the bus had already gone, and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly. One side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of the river; the other was a semicircle of slant-roofed brick buildings of about the 1800 period, from which several streets radiated away to the southeast, south, and southwest. Lamps were depressingly few and small\u2014all low-powered incandescents\u2014and I was glad that my plans called for departure before dark, even though I knew the moon would be bright."}

Near the start of the financial quarter, Henderson thought deeply a lot. This was because his growing email inbxo did not decrease. He was also worried by what some other department heasd said. They talked about his random \"reply all\" messages. It appeared he was often the cause of widespread digital noise. The constatn sound of notifications at certain work hours was noticed by the man in the next cubicle. This man also mentioned seeing the spread of unnecessary email threads. But Henderson was sure he must have been wrong about this. In his own view, his messages and their files were alawys exactly relevant. A person could experience many kinds of eye trciks in this one-eyed corporate building. Did not Henderson himself, even in the bright of noon, now feel sure that messages other than important news came from the black spaces past the divided walls. Above the ceiling tiles? His overly sesnitive eyes started to look for weak, flashing signals on the long-ignored emali lists. Sometimes the false idea of their importance was painfully real.\n###\nAround the first of the fiscal quarter, Henderson brooded considerably because his mounting inbox did not abate. He was also troubled by what some of his fellow-department heads said about his indiscriminate reply-all missives. It seemed that he was often the source of widespread digital clamour, and that the ceaseless chiming of notifications at certain hours of the workday was remarked by the man in the cubicle adjacent. This fellow also spoke of witnessing the proliferation of superfluous threads; but Henderson was sure he must have been mistaken in this, since his messages as well as their attachments were always precisely pertinent in his own estimation. One could develop all sorts of optical delusions in this cyclopean corporate architecture\u2014for did not Henderson himself, even in full fluorescence of noon, now feel certain that communiqu\u00e9s other than vital bulletins issued from the black voids beyond the partitioned walls and above the drop-ceiling tiles? His pathologically sensitive eyes began to watch for faint, flickering indicators upon the immemorially neglected distribution lists, and sometimes the illusion of their necessity was agonisingly realistic."}

He did not know how much pride, secrecy. Faint heavenly memory might fill those children of the Great Ones. He was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his search.

They talked little with the other folk in those ancient sea-taverns; but would gather in groups in remote corners and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places, or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of dreamland. And so rare and moving were those airs and tales, that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened, even though the words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody. For a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of Celepha\u00efs, and before they sailed Carter had taken passage on their dark ship, telling them that he was an old onyx-miner and wishful to work in their quarries. That ship was very lovely and cunningly wrought, being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold, and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet. One morning at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lifted, and as Carter stood on the high stern he saw the sunrise-blazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless Celepha\u00efs sink into the distance, and the snowy peak of Mount Aran grow smaller and smaller. By noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the Cerenerian Sea, with one painted galley afar off bound for that cloud-hung realm of Serannian where the sea meets the sky. And night came with gorgeous stars, and the dark ship steered for Charles\u2019 Wain and the Little Bear as they swung slowly round the pole. And the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places, and then stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea. Carter went to sleep at midnight, and rose in the glow of a young morning, marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont. And all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men of the ship, getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight land, of their exquisite onyx city, and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which Leng was said to be."}

Dean's Corners, for the needed cleanings of those ordinary homes. Far to the west, almost in that dark area whose existence the town's people did not like to admit, there was an unused laundromat bigger than all the others. From it had been sent out in forgotten times such huge steams and bad smells. The scent of their remaining dampness caused unease in all who noticed it. Who had run those incredible machines. Where the customers had gone, no one could say. But it was thought best not to visit that laundromat. Around it, such non-living memories might possibly stick. So it was left all alone in the sodium-lit golom. Only the ticking clock and the rumored dryer-vent were there to think about its emptiness.

And far to the west, almost in that benighted precinct whose existence the dwellers of the town did not care to acknowledge, there was an unused laundry greater than all the rest; from which had been expelled in forgotten times such prodigious vapours and miasmas that the scent of their lingering dampness struck unease to all who perceived. Who had operated those incredible machines, and whither the patrons had departed, no man might say; but it was thought best not to frequent that laundry, around which such inorganic memories might conceivably cling. So it was left all alone in the sodium-lit gloom, with only the ticking clock and the rumoured dryer-vent to brood on its emptiness. When Carter heard of this laundry he was moved to deep contemplation, for he knew from old sensations that the true comfort against the outer chill is of such artificial, cyclopean warmth."}

A sewing woman had left threads in a Boston attic to fix it. Its French lace edge. But that sewing woman's name was not known to Arkham families. In time she fell out of memory.

These were never given without a careful study of the criminal's reasons. Warfare was mostly civil for the last few thousand years.

All weather readings were taken from the familiar almanac on the evening of the next day. This was October the 12th, after a quick and smooth reading. On the 13th I figured out the barometer signs in two sessions. The one break was very short. It was caused by a faulty transmission in the fierce static on the radio.

Symbols set before me, were giving in to the growing veil of doubt. I was working through the data with the mocking numbers of the mercury column rising up against a troubled fall syk. It twisted the announcer's words into a wide, prophetic mutterign that chilled my soul deeply. Less than two weeks latre I left the last trace of reliable prediction behind me.

On the contrary, they tended to increase. and of his shipping business was handled by captains. He bound them to him with ties of fear. These ties were as the ties of bankruptcy had been. He gave up the slave trade. He said its profits were getting. He spent every moment at the Pawtuxet farm., there were and rumors of his presence in places. These places were not near graveyards. They were located in relation to graveyards in a way that made people wonder. They wondered how the merchant 's change of habits was. Ezra Weeden, though his spying periods were. Broken because of his sea voyages, had a persistence. of the townsfolk and farmers lacked this persistence. He examined Curwen 's affairs with a scrutiny they had had. of the maneuvers of the merchant 's ships had been accepted as. This was because of the unrest of the times. Every colonist seemed to resist the rules of the Sugar Act. Those rules hampered an trade. Smuggling and evasion were the practice in Narragansett Bay. Nighttime landings of cargoes were eevnts. But Weeden, night after night, followed the lighters or sloops. He saw them steal from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks. He felt it was not His Majesty 's ships that the person was to avoid. Before the change in 1766, these boats had contained negroes. They were carried down and across the bay. They were landed at a point on the shore of Pawtuxet., they were driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm. they were locked in that stone outbuilding. It had, slits for windows. After that change,, the plan was. The import of slaves stopped at. For a time, Curwen stopped his midnight sailings., about the spring of 1767, a policy appeared. the lighters became to leaving the, docks. This time they would go down the bay some distance. they went as Namquit Point. they would meet and take cargo from ships. These ships were of size and appearance.\n###\nBut Curwen\u2019s feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet farm; though there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchant\u2019s change of habits really was. Ezra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and subjected Curwen\u2019s affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before. Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchant\u2019s vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times, when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the Sugar Act which hampered a prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But Weeden, night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon felt assured that it was not merely His Majesty\u2019s armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid. Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes, who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of Pawtuxet; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm, where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme was altered. Importation of slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen abandoned his midnight sailings. Then, about the spring of 1767, a new policy appeared. Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black, silent docks, and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance."}

The old trees, scarred by lightning, seemed unnaturally large and twisted. The other plants seemed unnaturally thick and feverish. Humps in the weedy, lightning - pitted [THING] reminded me of snakes. Dead men 's skulls. They seemed swollen to huge sizes. Fear had hidden on Tempest Mountain for over a hundred years. I learned this immediately from newspaper reports of the disaster. This disaster first brought the area to the world 's attention. The place is a remote, lonely hill in that part of the Catskills. Dutch civilization once weakly and briefly reached there. As it pulled back, it left only a few ruined mansions. It left a degraded squatter population living in pitiful small villages on isolated slopes. Normal beings rarely visited the area until the state police were formed. Even now, only occasional troopers patrol it. However, fear is an old tradition in all the nearby villages. It is a main topic in the simple talk of the poor mixed - breed [THING]. They sometimes leave their valleys to trdae [THING] - woven baskets for basic necessities they can not shoot, grow. The lurking fear lived in the avoided and deserted Martense mansion. It crowned the high but gradual hill. The hill 's tendency to have frequent thunderstorms gave it the name Tempest Mountain. For over a century, the old, grove - surrounded [THING] [THING] had been the subject of stories. The stories were incredibly wild and monstrously hideous. They told of a silent, giant, creeping death that walked abroad in summer. With whining insistence, squatters told tales of a demon. It seized lonely travelers after dark. It either carried them off. Left them in a terrible state of chewed. Sometimes they whispered of blood trails leading toward the distant mansion. Some said the thunder called the lurking fear from its home. Others said the thunder was its voice. No one outside the remote areas believed these varying and conflicting stories. Their descriptions of the half - seen fiend were incoherent and exaggerated. Not a single farmer. Villager doubted that the Martense mansion was haunted by ghouls. Local history did not allow such doubt. This was true evne though investigators found no ghoslty evidence. They visited the [THING] after some especially vivid tale from the squatters. Grandmothers told strange myths about the Martense ghost. The myths concerned the Martense family itself. They spoke of its odd hereditary difference in [THING] color. Tehy spoke of its long, unnatural history, and the murder that had cursed it.\n###\nOf wild creatures there were none\u2014they are wise when death leers close.

Fear had lurked on Tempest Mountain for more than a century. This I learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first brought the region to the world\u2019s notice. The place is a remote, lonely elevation in that part of the Catskills where Dutch civilisation once feebly and transiently penetrated, leaving behind as it receded only a few ruined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes. Normal beings seldom visited the locality till the state police were formed, and even now only infrequent troopers patrol it. The fear, however, is an old tradition throughout the neighbouring villages; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade hand-woven baskets for such primitive necessities as they cannot shoot, raise, or make. The lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted Martense mansion, which crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent thunderstorms gave it the name of Tempest Mountain. For over a hundred years the antique, grove-circled stone house had been the subject of stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous; stories of a silent colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer. With whimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a daemon which seized lone wayfarers after dark, either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment; while sometimes they whispered of blood-trails toward the distant mansion. Some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation, while others said the thunder was its voice. No one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting stories, with their incoherent, extravagant descriptions of the half-glimpsed fiend; yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the Martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted. Local history forbade such a doubt, although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such investigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid tale of the squatters. Grandmothers told strange myths of the Martense spectre; myths concerning the Martense family itself, its queer hereditary dissimilarity of eyes, its long, unnatural annals, and the murder which had cursed it."}

I did not try to explain to myself how any dream. Piece of learned story, could have taught me a detail. I was beyond all thought. For was not this experience a horror beyond all reason? This familiarity with a set of ruins. This match of everything before me with what dreams. Bits of myth could have suggested. it was my belief, as it is during my saner moments, that I was not. I believed the buried city was a piece of vision. I reached the level and moved to the right of the slope. For some reason, I tried to soften my steps, though I lost speed because of it. There was a space I was to cross on this, buried floor. As I got near it, I remembered what thing in that space I feared. It was one of the metal - barred and guarded trapdoors. There would be no guards. Because of that, I shook. Walked on my toes as I had done when passing through that basalt room. A trapdoor had gaped. I felt a flow of, air, as I had felt. I wished my path led another way. I did not know why I had to take the path I was taking. When I came to the space, I saw that the trapdoor gaped. the shelves began. I saw on the floor in front of one of them a piel covered with dust. A number of boxes had fallen. At the moment, wave of panic grabbed me. For some time I could not discover why. Heaps of fallen boxes were not. through the ages, this lightless maze had been shaken by the movements of the earth. At times it had echoed with the noise of falling objects. It was when I was across the space that I realized why I shook. Not the pile, but something about the dust on the floor was troubling me. In my torchlight, it seemed as if that dust was not as it should be. There were places where it looked, as if it had been disturbed not months.\n###\nDream or not, I had once known and still knew. How any dream\u2014or scrap of unconsciously absorbed legend\u2014could have taught me a detail so minute, so intricate, and so complex, I did not attempt to explain to myself. I was beyond all coherent thought. For was not this whole experience\u2014this shocking familiarity with a set of unknown ruins, and this monstrously exact identity of everything before me with what only dreams and scraps of myth could have suggested\u2014a horror beyond all reason? Probably it was my basic conviction then\u2014as it is now during my saner moments\u2014that I was not awake at all, and that the entire buried city was a fragment of febrile hallucination. Eventually I reached the lowest level and struck off to the right of the incline. For some shadowy reason I tried to soften my steps, even though I lost speed thereby. There was a space I was afraid to cross on this last, deeply buried floor, and as I drew near it I recalled what thing in that space I feared. It was merely one of the metal-barred and closely guarded trap-doors. There would be no guards now, and on that account I trembled and tiptoed as I had done in passing through that black basalt vault where a similar trap-door had yawned. I felt a current of cool, damp air, as I had felt there, and wished that my course led in another direction. Why I had to take the particular course I was taking, I did not know. When I came to the space I saw that the trap-door yawned widely open. Ahead the shelves began again, and I glimpsed on the floor before one of them a heap very thinly covered with dust, where a number of cases had recently fallen. At the same moment a fresh wave of panic clutched me, though for some time I could not discover why. Heaps of fallen cases were not uncommon, for all through the aeons this lightless labyrinth had been racked by the heavings of earth and had echoed at intervals to the deafening clatter of toppling objects. It was only when I was nearly across the space that I realised why I shook so violently. Not the heap, but something about the dust of the level floor was troubling me. In the light of my torch it seemed as if that dust were not as even as it ought to be\u2014there were places where it looked thinner, as if it had been disturbed not many months before."}

On On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was quickly called by Wilbur Whateley. Wilbur Whateley had whipped his one remaining horse through the dark. Phoned from Osborn 's in the [THING]. He found Old Whateley in a very serious condition. His heart action and noisy breathing showed the end was not far away. The formless albino daughter and strangely bearded grandson stood by the bed. From the empty space above came a troubling sense of rhythmic swelling or lapping. It was like waves on a flat beach. However, the doctor was mostly bothered by the chattering night birds outside. There seemed to be a limitless number of whippoorwills. They cried their endless message again and again. Their timing matched the dying [THING] 's wheezing breaths in an evil way. It was weird and unnatural. Dr. Houghton thought it was too much like the whole area he had entered. Unwillingly after the urgent call. \" More spaec, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows \u2014 and that grows faster. It 'll be ready to serve you soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog - Sothoth with the long chant you 'll find on page 751 of the complete edition. Then light a match to the prison. [THING] from [THING] ca n't burn it anyway. \" He was clearly very mad. After a pause, the flock of whippoorwills outside changed their cries to match the new speed. Some signs of the strange hill noises came from far away. He added another sentence or two. \" Feed it regularly, Willy, and watch the amount. But do n't let it grow too fast for the place. If it breaks out of its [THING]. Gets out before you open to Yog - Sothoth, it 's all over. Only those from beyond can make it multiply and work.... Only them, the old ones who want to come back.... \" But speech changde back to gasps again. Lavinia screamed at how the whippoorwills followed the change. This continued for more than an hour. Then the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton closed the shrunken eyelids over the glazing grey eyes. The noise of the birds faded slowly to silence. Lavinia cried, but Wilbur only laughed quietly while the hill noises rumbled softly. Wilbur was by now a scholar of truly huge learning in his narrow way. Many librarians in far - off places kenw him quietly through letters.

He found Old Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural\u2014too much, thought Dr. Houghton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call. \u201cMore space, Willy, more space soon.

Fire from airth can\u2019t burn it nohaow.\u201d He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added another sentence or two. \u201cFeed it reg\u2019lar, Willy, an\u2019 mind the quantity; but dun\u2019t let it grow too fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to Yog-Sothoth, it\u2019s all over an\u2019 no use.

Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.

The smallest of these palaces was stronger tahn any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron. Tall that a preson inside might think they were under the open sky. When lit by torches dipped in the oil of Dothur, their walls showed huge paintings of kings. The paintings were so splendid they inspired and amazed the viewer. The palaces had many pillars. All the pillars were made of colored marble. They were carved with designs of great beauty. In most palaces, the floors were mosaics. They used beryl, lapis-lazuli, sardonyx, carbuncle, and other fine stones. They were arranged so the viewer might think they walked over beds of rare flowers. There were also fountains. They sprayed scented water in pretty jtes made with clever art. Above all others was the palace of the kings of Mnar and nearby lands. The throne rested on two golden crouching lions. It was many steps above the shining floor. The throne was made from a single piece of ivory. No one knows where such a large piece could have come from. That palace also had many galleries. It had many amphitheaters. In them, lions, men, and elephants fought for the kings' pleasure. Sometimes the amphitheaters were flooded with water. The water came from the lake through large aqueducts. Then they held exciting sea battles. Or they had fights between swimmers and deadly sea creatures. Also amazing were the seventeen tower-like tempels of Sarnath. They were made of a bright, multi-colored stoen not found elsewhere. The greatest temple stood a full thousand cubits high. The high-priests lived there with splendor almost equal to the kings. On the ground were halls as large and splendid as those in the palaces. Crowds gathered there to wroship Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon. These were the chief gods of Sarnath. Their shrines, covered in incense, were like thrones of monarchs. The images of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon were not like those of othre gods. Lifelike one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sat on the ivory thrones. Endless steps of shining zircon led up to tower-chamber. From there, the high-priests appeared out over the city, the plains. The lake by day. By night, they looked at the mysterious moon, the important stars. Their reflections in the lake.\n###\nThere were many palaces, the least of which were mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron. So high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of Dothur their walls shewed vast paintings of kings and armies, of a splendour at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder. Many were the pillars of the palaces, all of tinted marble, and carven into designs of surpassing beauty. And in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis-lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials, so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers. And there were likewise fountains, which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning art. Outshining all others was the palace of the kings of Mnar and of the lands adjacent. On a pair of golden crouching lions rested the throne, many steps above the gleaming floor. And it was wrought of one piece of ivory, though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come. In that palace there were also many galleries, and many amphitheatres where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the kings. Sometimes the amphitheatres were flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts, and then were enacted stirring sea-fights, or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine things. Lofty and amazing were the seventeen tower-like temples of Sarnath, fashioned of a bright multi-coloured stone not known elsewhere. A full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them, wherein the high-priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings. On the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the palaces; where gathered throngs in worship of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon, the chief gods of Sarnath, whose incense-enveloped shrines were as the thrones of monarchs. Not like the eikons of other gods were those of Zo-Kalar and Tamash and Lobon, for so close to life were they that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the ivory thrones. And up unending steps of shining zircon was the tower-chamber, wherefrom the high-priests looked out over the city and the plains and the lake by day; and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and planets, and their reflections in the lake, by night."}

However, during some unavoidable waits, we could sense the boredom. This was especially true when it was late and the store was full. There was also a more subtle thing we often thougth we noticed. It was a very strange thing, but it was onyl a suggestion at most. I mean a kind of unclear, changing pattren on the old linoleum floor. It was a faint, uneven layer of dirt or scuff marks. We sometimes thought we could see it among the sparse, tracked debris near the huge conveyor belt at the checkout. Once in a. It struck us that this patch looked strangely like some twisted, symbolic sign. Usually, no such connection existed. Often, there was no visible deposit at all.

It rose from the fluorescent lights toward the open mouth of the receipt printer. I spoke to my friend about this matter.

Beacuse of this, it has a certain respect. This respect even applies to the messy workers there. But until recently, one person was outside this respect. He sharde the dirt and mess of Sheehan's, but not its importance. He was called \"Old Bugs\". He was the worst person in a place. Many tried to guess what he had been before. When he was drunk to a point, his language and way of speaking caused surprise. But what he was now was easier to see. \"Old Bugs\" was the perfect example of the sad type called a \"bum\" or \"down-and-outer\". No one could tell Whence he had come from. One night, he rushed wildly into Sheehan's. He was foaming at the mouth and screaming for whiskey and hashish. He was given these in exchange for a promise to do jobs. He stayed there ever since. He mops floors, cleans spittoons and glasses, and does many similar tasks.

Still dazed, he clutched at the spiky thing and staggered downstairs to Landlord Dombrowski\u2019s quarters. The whining prayers of the superstitious loomfixer were still sounding through the mouldy halls, but Gilman did not mind them now. The landlord was in, and greeted him pleasantly. No, he had not seen that thing before and did not know anything about it. But his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon, and maybe that was it. Dombrowski called her, and she waddled in. Yes, that was the thing. She had found it in the young gentleman\u2019s bed\u2014on the side next the wall. It had looked very queer to her, but of course the young gentleman had lots of queer things in his room\u2014books and curios and pictures and markings on paper. She certainly knew nothing about it. So Gilman climbed upstairs again in a mental turmoil, convinced that he was either still dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to incredible extremes and led him to depredations in unknown places. Where had he got this outr\u00e9 thing? He did not recall seeing it in any museum in Arkham. It must have been somewhere, though; and the sight of it as he snatched it in his sleep must have caused the odd dream-picture of the balustraded terrace. Next day he would make some very guarded inquiries\u2014and perhaps see the nerve specialist. Meanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism. As he went upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had borrowed\u2014with a frank admission as to its purpose\u2014from the landlord. He had stopped at Elwood\u2019s door on the way, but had found all dark within. Entering his room, he placed the spiky thing on the table, and lay down in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing to undress. From the closed loft above the slanting ceiling he thought he heard a faint scratching and padding, but he was too disorganised even to mind it. That cryptical pull from the north was getting very strong again, though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the sky. In the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged, furry thing came again and with a greater distinctness than on any former occasion."}

This is because it was the sound that poro Lake's dissection had made us connect to the things we thought were dead. Danforth later told us it was exactly the sound we heard very faintly before. We heard it at that spot past the alley-corner above the ice level. It was very similar to the wind sounds we both heard near the high mountain caves. We will add one more thing, even if it seems childsih. We add it because Danforth had the same surprising impression. Of course, we both reda the same things, which prepared us for this interpretation. However, Danforth has suggested strange ideas about hidden and forbidden sources. Poe may have used these sources when writing his Arthur Gordon Pym one hundred years ago. Remember that in that strange story, there is a word. This word has an unknown but terrible and huge meaning connected to the Antarctic. Giant, ghostly wihte birds in that evil region's core scream it forever. \"Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!\" We admit that is exactly what we thought we heard in that sudden sound behind the moving white mist. It was that sneaky musical piping over a very wide range.\n###\nThe new sound, as I have intimated, upset much that we had decided; because it was what poor Lake\u2019s dissection had led us to attribute to those we had just judged dead. It was, Danforth later told me, precisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that spot beyond the alley-corner above the glacial level; and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to the wind-pipings we had both heard around the lofty mountain caves. At the risk of seeming puerile I will add another thing, too; if only because of the surprising way Danforth\u2019s impression chimed with mine. Of course common reading is what prepared us both to make the interpretation, though Danforth has hinted at queer notions about unsuspected and forbidden sources to which Poe may have had access when writing his Arthur Gordon Pym a century ago. It will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic, spectrally snowy birds of that malign region\u2019s core. \u201cTekeli-li! Tekeli-li!\u201d That, I may admit, is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the advancing white mist\u2014that insidious musical piping over a singularly wide range."}

I felt the feelings of restlessness. I spoke with the man. I told him of my desire to leave for Cathuria. No man has seen it. All believe it lies beyond the basalt pillars of the West. It is the Land of Hope. The ideals of all we konw shine in it. Or at that is what men say. The man said to me: \" Be of those seas where men say Cathuria lies. In In Sona - Nyl there is no pain or death. Who can tell what lies beyond the basalt pillars of the West? \" Natheless at the moon I boarded the White Ship. With the man, I left the harbor for seas no one has traveled. The bird of heaven flew. It led us toward the basalt pillars of the West. But this time the rowers sang no songs under the moon. In my mind, I would picture the Land of Cathuria with its woods. I wondered what joys waited for me. \" Cathuria, \" I would say to myself, \" is the home of gods. The land of cities of gold. Its forests are of aloe and sandalwood, like the groves of Camorin. birds that sing fly among the trees. On the and flowery mountains of Cathuria stand temples of marble. They are with carved and painted glory. In their courtyards are fountains of silver. waters flow with music. These waters come from the river Narg born in a cave. The cities of Cathuria are surrounded by walls. Their streets are made of gold. In the gardens of these cities are orchids. There are perfumed lakes with beds of coral and amber. At night the streets and gardens are lit with lanterns. These are made from the three - shell of the tortoise. you hear the notes of singers and players. The houses in the cities of Cathuria are all palaces. Each is built over a canal. This canal carries the waters of the Narg. The houses are made of marble and porphyry. Their roofs are shining gold. This gold reflects the sun 's rays. It makes the cities when gods view them from mountain tops.\n###\nIt was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of Tharp that I saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird, and felt the first stirrings of unrest. Then I spoke with the bearded man, and told him of my new yearnings to depart for remote Cathuria, which no man hath seen, but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the West. It is the Land of Hope, and in it shine the perfect ideals of all that we know elsewhere; or at least so men relate. But the bearded man said to me: \u201cBeware of those perilous seas wherein men say Cathuria lies. In Sona-Nyl there is no pain nor death, but who can tell what lies beyond the basalt pillars of the West?\u201d Natheless at the next full moon I boarded the White Ship, and with the reluctant bearded man left the happy harbour for untravelled seas. And the bird of heaven flew before, and led us toward the basalt pillars of the West, but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full moon. In my mind I would often picture the unknown Land of Cathuria with its splendid groves and palaces, and would wonder what new delights there awaited me. \u201cCathuria,\u201d I would say to myself, \u201cis the abode of gods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold. Its forests are of aloe and sandalwood, even as the fragrant groves of Camorin, and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with song. On the green and flowery mountains of Cathuria stand temples of pink marble, rich with carven and painted glories, and having in their courtyards cool fountains of silver, where purl with ravishing music the scented waters that come from the grotto-born river Narg. And the cities of Cathuria are cinctured with golden walls, and their pavements also are of gold. In the gardens of these cities are strange orchids, and perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and amber. At night the streets and the gardens are lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from the three-coloured shell of the tortoise, and here resound the soft notes of the singer and the lutanist. And the houses of the cities of Cathuria are all palaces, each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of the sacred Narg. Of marble and porphyry are the houses, and roofed with glittering gold that reflects the rays of the sun and enhances the splendour of the cities as blissful gods view them from the distant peaks."}

As the weeks passed without news, a kind of tension began to grow between the youth. This was in his mother \u2019s case. She disapproved of all Curwen studies.

He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast. Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mother\u2019s case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings. During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute. About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Ward\u2019s bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest."}

Others ended in pyramid shapes with steps. On these pyramids stood groups of towers showing every kind of. The walls were not, and they had gates cut through them. Each gate was under a arch that rose than the walls around it. The top of each arch was carved with the head of a god. This carving showed the skill seen in the face on Ngranek. A hill stood in the city 's center. On it rose a tower with sixteen sides. This tower was than all the others. It had a bell tower with spires sitting on a, dome. sailors said this was the Temple of the Elder Ones. An - priest ruled it, a man said to be because of knowledge inside him., the, shaking sound of a bell rang over the stone city. Each time, an answering sound of music would play. This music was made from horns, string instruments, and singing voices., from a row of three - stands on a balcony around the temple 's dome, flames would burst out at times. The priests and people of that city knew the mysteries. They were to follow the rhythms of the Great Ones as written in scorlls than the Pnakotic Manuscripts. As the ship sailed past the stone wall into the harbor, the sounds of the city became. Carter saw the slaves, sailors, and merchants on the docks. The sailors and merchants had the faces of the god race. The slaves were people with eyes. Rumors said they came from valleys beyond Leng, crossing. Going around the mountains that can not be passed. The docks stretched outside the city wall. They held all sorts of goods from the ships anchored. At one end were piles of stone, both carved and. These waited to be sent to the markets of Rinar, Ogrothan, and Celepha\u00efs. It was when ship anchored to a stone pier that stuck out. All the sailors. Traders walked off the ship. Throuhg the gate into the city. The streets of that city were paved with stone. Some streets were and. Others were and. The houses near the water were than the others. Above their arched doorways were signs. People said these signs honored gods who faovred each house.\n###\nSome ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point, others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination. The walls were low, and pierced by frequent gates, each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant Ngranek. On a hill in the centre rose a sixteen-angled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome. This, the seamen said, was the Temple of the Elder Ones, and was ruled by an old high-priest sad with inner secrets. At intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city, answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns, viols, and chanting voices. And from a row of tripods on a gallery round the high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments; for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries, and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the Great Ones as set forth in scrolls older than the Pnakotic Manuscripts. As the ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city grew manifest, and Carter saw the slaves, sailors, and merchants on the docks. The sailors and merchants were of the strange-faced race of the gods, but the slaves were squat, slant-eyed folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the impassable peaks from valleys beyond Leng. The wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of merchandise from the galleys anchored there, while at one end were great piles of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of Rinar, Ogrothan, and Celepha\u00efs. It was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay of stone, and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through the arched gate into the city. The streets of that city were paved with onyx, and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked and narrow. The houses near the water were lower than the rest, and bore above their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour of the respective small gods that favoured each."}

Wilbur was by a scholar of learning in his way. librarians in - off places knew him through letters. These places kept and books from times. People around Dunwich hated and feared him and. This was because of people disappearing. Suspicion pointed at him. He could stop questions through fear. By using his supply of gold coins. That gold went out. to buy cows, as in his grandfather 's time. He looked. His height had reached the adult limit and seemed to grow beyond it. In 1925, a writer from Miskatonic University visited him one day. The writer left pale and. He was six feet and nine inches. \" There 's about him that I know than I can tell you, Mamie, \" she said. \" And there 's than what I know myself. I swear after Gawd, I do n't know what he wants. What he 's trying to do. \" That Halloween, the hill noises sounded than. Fire burned on Sentinel Hill as. People paid attention to the screaming of flocks of whippoorwills. They seemed gathered near the Whateley farmhouse. After midnight, their notes burst into a kind of laughter. It filled all the countryside. They did not quiet down until dawn. they vanished, hurrying where they were a month. No one could be what this meant until. None of the country people seemed to have died. But Lavinia Whateley, the deformed albino, was seen. In the summer of 1927, Wilbur fixed two sheds in the farmyard. He began moving his books and things out to them., Earl Sawyer told the people relaxing at Osborn 's that carpentry was happening in the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor. He seemed to be taking out walls as he. His grandfather had done four years. He was living in one of the sheds. Sawyer thought he seemed and. People suspected him of knowing something about his mother 's disappearance. people went near his area.\n###\nLavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly. Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time gold which still, as in his grandfather\u2019s time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying. He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached the normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In 1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three-quarters feet tall. \u201cThey\u2019s more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,\u201d she said, \u201can\u2019 naowadays they\u2019s more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur Gawd, I dun\u2019t know what he wants nor what he\u2019s a-tryin\u2019 to dew.\u201d That Hallowe\u2019en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on Sentinel Hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley farmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandaemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no one could quite be certain till later. None of the country folk seemed to have died\u2014but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never seen again. In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl Sawyer told the loungers at Osborn\u2019s that more carpentry was going on in the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother\u2019s disappearance, and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now."}

This was measured by our response to things outside our madness. It is true we were always scohlars and antiquarians. Even our best early work did not show the amazing understanding. Inisght we showed during our last exams by the mental doctors. It was indeed to get a legal order to put us in the hospital. Our minds seemed so powerful and clear. We were finally confined only because of other people's evidence. Many abnormal gaps in our knowledge, not our intelligence. Until the moment we vanished, we read everything. Talked as much as our weak voices allowed. Observers who did not foresee our escape freely predicted we would soon be released from custody.\n###\nPsychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Ward\u2019s family physician, affirms that the patient\u2019s gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youth\u2019s mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody."}

We are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his friedn after the end, as a clue to the thing that had happened. Whether, as is, Smith had it. Added the underline himself from what he had managed to learn from his friend by guessing. The passage is this: \" I say to you, do not call up Any that you can not put down.

The copy was found in the possession of Smith\u2019s descendants; and we are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more probable, Smith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely this: \u201cI say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you.\u201d The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions; but Capt. Tillinghast was an astute man, and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter change their name, burn the library and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above Joseph Curwen\u2019s grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end of the accused sorcerer. From that time on the obliteration of Curwen\u2019s memory became increasingly rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the Gazette. It can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on Oscar Wilde\u2019s name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsany\u2019s tale, whom the Gods decided must not only cease to be, but must cease ever to have been. Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in Olney Court and resided with her father in Power\u2019s Lane till her death in 1817.

He said he must get it to Orne and Hutchinson at once. So when he seemed fully conscious, the doctor told him this. He said that of those strange beings, at least one was his fierce enemy. That one had given Dr. Allen advice for his murder. This news showed no clear effect. Before it was given, the visitors could see their host already had the look of a hunted [THING]. After that, he would talk no more. So Willett and the father left soon after. They left behind a warning about the bearded Allen.

After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr\u00e9-looking missive. There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself.

However, he was very ugly despite looking bright. His thick lips, large-pored yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair. Oddly long ears seemed almost goat-like. Soon people disliked him more than his mother and grandfather. All guesses about him included references to the past magic of Old Whateley.

His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace."}

That there I was no mere visitor or transient, but a creature of acute sensitivity and vivid awareness; perceiving keenly and dominantly, and checked only by a certain underlying taint, which seemed to be a scent of palpable yet ethereal structure, and which did not appear to be of natural origin, since I never referred to it as floral, or as aught save a miasma. This miasma had done the atmosphere some hideous but unnamed wrong, which the vigilant observer (if observer I were) yearned to expunge. From the manner in which I alluded to their mingling, I judged that it and the pristine fragrance had met on equal terms; that in this olfactory existence the scent was itself a chemical thing of the same race as its enemy. This impression was sustained by my frequent references to drifting through sterile space and cleansing all that impeded its dominion. Yet these conceptions were formulated in common words wholly inadequate to convey them, a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a true scent-world indeed existed, oral language was not its medium for the transmission of essence. Could it be that the ethereal emanation inhabiting this inferior chamber was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dulness could not utter?

For a week, I fully enjoyed the joys of that tomb fellowship I must not describe. Then it happened. I was taken away to this cursed place of sadness. I should not have gone out that night. The threat of thunder was in the cloud.s A hellish glow roes from the rotten swamp at the bottom of the valley. The call of the dead was also different.

I should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of thunder was in the clouds, and a hellish phosphorescence rose from the rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow. The call of the dead, too, was different. Instead of the hillside tomb, it was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with unseen fingers. As I emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain before the ruin, I beheld in the misty moonlight a thing I had always vaguely expected. The mansion, gone for a century, once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the splendour of many candles. Up the long drive rolled the coaches of the Boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions. With this throng I mingled, though I knew I belonged with the hosts rather than with the guests. Inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand. Several faces I recognised; though I should have known them better had they been shrivelled or eaten away by death and decomposition. Amidst a wild and reckless throng I was the wildest and most abandoned. Gay blasphemy poured in torrents from my lips, and in my shocking sallies I heeded no law of God, Man, or Nature. Suddenly a peal of thunder, resonant even above the din of the swinish revelry, clave the very roof and laid a hush of fear upon the boisterous company."}

It had cost me a distinct psychological effort to do so, and now that I was shut inside I had a momentary longing for precipitate retreat. Not that the place was in the least sinister in visual suggestion; on the contrary, I thought the graceful late-colonial hallway very tasteful and wholesome, and admired the evident breeding of the man who had furnished it. What made me wish to flee was something very attenuated and indefinable. Perhaps it was a certain odd odour which I thought I noticed\u2014though I well knew how common musty odours are in even the best of ancient farmhouses."}

Still, our scientific and adventurous spirits were not completely gone. We automatically followed our plan to chip smaples from all the different rock types in the stonework.

That man from centuries and forbidden secrets troubled the world. The madness from beyond time had ended. The case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Before closing his eyes and staggering from that room, Dr. Willett saw that his memory had been. As he had predicted, there had been no need for acids. Like his picture a year, Joseph Curwen lay scattered on the floor. It was a layer of - dust. In the region of Arkham, the hills rise. There are valleys with woods that no axe has cut. There are, glesn where the trees lean in ways. streams trickle, catching the sunlight. On the slopes there are farms. They are and, with, moss - covered cottages.

Some traces will remain when half the hollows are flooded for the reservoir. the woods will be cut down. The heath will sleep below waters.

The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust. West of Arkham the hills rise wild, and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever cut. There are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically, and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the glint of sunlight. On the gentler slopes there are farms, ancient and rocky, with squat, moss-coated cottages brooding eternally over old New England secrets in the lee of great ledges; but these are all vacant now, the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs. The old folk have gone away, and foreigners do not like to live there. French-Canadians have tried it, Italians have tried it, and the Poles have come and departed. It is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled, but because of something that is imagined. The place is not good for the imagination, and does not bring restful dreams at night. It must be this which keeps the foreigners away, for old Ammi Pierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the strange days. Ammi, whose head has been a little queer for years, is the only one who still remains, or who ever talks of the strange days; and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads around Arkham. There was once a road over the hills and through the valleys, that ran straight where the blasted heath is now; but people ceased to use it and a new road was laid curving far toward the south. Traces of the old one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness, and some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are flooded for the new reservoir. Then the dark woods will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun."}

The ghouls told the observer to avoid this cave as much as possible. They said it was the entrance to the cursed underground rooms of Zin. In those rooms, gugs hunt ghasts in the The warning was soon proven correct. A ghoul started to creep toward some towers to check if it was the right time for the gugs to rest. Then, in the cave mouth, one pair of yellowish-red eyes glowed, then another pair. This meant there was one less gug guard. It also meant the ghasts have a very sense of smell. So the ghoul went back to the burrow and signaled his companions to be It was best to leave the ghasts alone.

This the ghouls told Carter to avoid as much as possible, since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of Zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness. And truly, that warning was soon well justified; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs\u2019 resting had been rightly timed, there glowed in the gloom of that great cavern\u2019s mouth first one pair of yellowish-red eyes and then another, implying that the gugs were one sentry less, and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell. So the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent. It was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices, and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw, since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black vaults. After a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight, and Carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast, whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose, a forehead, and other important particulars."}

Eliot Street stragglers would see me from either of two points. At the moment, I decided to slow my jog. I would make the crossing as, using the shuffling walk of an Innsmouth natiev. When the view of the water opened, this time on my right, I was - determined not to look at it. But I could not resist. I cast a glance as I. shuffled toward the protecting shadows. No ship was, though I expected one., the thing I noticed was a rowboat pulling toward the abandoned wharves. It carried some object covered with a tarpaulin. Its rowers, seen from a distance and not, had a look. swimmers were. On the reef, I could see a, glow. It was unlike the winking light seen. It had a color I could not name. Above slanted roofs. To the right, the cupola of the Gilman House rose up. But it was. The smell, gone for a moment due to a breeze, returned with maddening strength. I had not crossed the street when I heard a muttering group coming along Washington from the north. When they reached the space where I saw the water with unease, I could see them a block. I was horrified by the abnormality of their faces. The dog -, crouch of their walk. One man moved in a ape - way, with arms touching ground. Another figure, robed and crowned, seemed to move in an hopping fashion. I believed this group was the one I had seen in the Gilman 's courtyard., it was the group on my trail. As some figures turned to look my way, I was frozen with fright. Yet I managed to keep the casual, shuffling walk I had taken on. To this day, I do not know if they saw me. If thye did, my trick must have fooled them. They passed across the space without changing their path., they croaked and jabbered in some, throaty language I could not understand.\n###\nMy greatest dread was in re-crossing broad and moonlit South Street\u2014with its seaward view\u2014and I had to nerve myself for the ordeal. Someone might easily be looking, and possible Eliot Street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points. At the last moment I decided I had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average Innsmouth native. When the view of the water again opened out\u2014this time on my right\u2014I was half-determined not to look at it at all. I could not, however, resist; but cast a sidelong glance as I carefully and imitatively shambled toward the protecting shadows ahead. There was no ship visible, as I had half expected there would be. Instead, the first thing which caught my eye was a small rowboat pulling in toward the abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky, tarpaulin-covered object. Its rowers, though distantly and indistinctly seen, were of an especially repellent aspect. Several swimmers were still discernible; while on the far black reef I could see a faint, steady glow unlike the winking beacon visible before, and of a curious colour which I could not precisely identify. Above the slant roofs ahead and to the right there loomed the tall cupola of the Gilman House, but it was completely dark. The fishy odour, dispelled for a moment by some merciful breeze, now closed in again with maddening intensity. I had not quite crossed the street when I heard a muttering band advancing along Washington from the north. As they reached the broad open space where I had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water I could see them plainly only a block away\u2014and was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the dog-like sub-humanness of their crouching gait. One man moved in a positively simian way, with long arms frequently touching the ground; while another figure\u2014robed and tiaraed\u2014seemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion. I judged this party to be the one I had seen in the Gilman\u2019s courtyard\u2014the one, therefore, most closely on my trail. As some of the figures turned to look in my direction I was transfixed with fright, yet managed to preserve the casual, shambling gait I had assumed. To this day I do not know whether they saw me or not. If they did, my stratagem must have deceived them, for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their course\u2014meanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois I could not identify."}

Its floor was more and more covered with ice and seemed below ground level. The roof got lower as we went forward. We strated to see strong daylight ahead and turned off our torch. It seemed we were reaching the vast circular place. We could not be very far from the open air. The corridor ended in an arch. It was surprisingly low for these huge stone ruins.

The lands were not clamied except by a representative of a new generation. Orne had destroyed most of his letters. But in 1717, citizens found and kept a few exciting papers.

It was made of frus and tent cloth taken from Lake's camp. We did not stop to study the shapes the fabrics were cut into. Slightly beyond this point we saw a clear increase in the size. Number of side passages. We decided we must have reached the densely honeycombed area under the higher foothills. The unknown smell was now oddly mixed with another, almost as smell. We could not guess its nature. We thought of rotting living things and maybe unknown underground fungi. Then came a surprising widening of the tunnel. The carvings had not prepared us for this. It broadened and rose into a tall, natural-looking oval cave with a flat floor. It was about 75 feet and 50 feet Many huge side passages led away into hidden darkness. Though this cave looked natural, looking with both torches suggested it was made by artificially breaking several walls between nearby honeycomb areas. The walls were rough. The arched roof was with hanging stone spikes. But the solid rock floor had been smoothed. It was free from all rubble, debris, or even dust to a very abnormal degree. Except for the path we came by, this was true for the floors of all the passages opening from it. The oddness of this condition made us puzzle uselessly. The curious stink that added to the unknown smell was very strong here. It was so strong it wiped out all trcae of the other. Something about this whole place, with its polished. Almost shiny floor, struck us as more vaguely confusing. than any monstrous thing we met before. The regularity of the passage straight ahead. The larger amuont of penguin droppings there, prevented all confusion about the right way among this excess of equally cave mouths. Still, we decided to restart our paper trail-blazing if any more complexity appeared. We could no longer expect dust tracks, of course. Upon continuing our direct path, we shone a torch beam on the tunnel walls. We stopped suddenly in surprise at the extremely radical change that had come over carvings in this part of the passage.\n###\nThe temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was composed of furs and tent-cloth taken from Lake\u2019s camp, and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed. Slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the side-galleries, and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been reached. The nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odour\u2014of what nature we could not guess, though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrene fungi. Then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us\u2014a broadening and rising into a lofty, natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor; some 75 feet long and 50 broad, and with many immense side-passages leading away into cryptical darkness. Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings. The walls were rough, and the high vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all debris, detritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent. Except for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of the floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling. The curious new foetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the other. Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost glistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered. The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion of penguin-droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great cave-mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trail-blazing if any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course, could no longer be expected. Upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel walls\u2014and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage."}

Again he seemed to be in the interior of a house\u2014an old house, apparently\u2014but the details and inhabitants were constantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects. It was queer\u2014damnably queer\u2014and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as if half expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris family. And all the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if some pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought to possess itself of his vital processes. I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they were by eighty-one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknown forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid; but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and that these uncomfortable visions could be, at most, no more than my uncle\u2019s reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled our minds to the exclusion of all else. Conversation, also, soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; and in time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncle seemed now very wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even though the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours. Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind.

I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoing yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood. My uncle\u2019s face came to me with less pleasant associations than in waking hours, and I recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not a pleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriek which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out with more than natural clearness and reality."}

Of these latter, one was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting eminence, while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the well-known Snake Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra. Flying inland from the mountains, we discovered that the city was not of infinite width, even though its length along the foothills seemed endless. After about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings began to thin out, and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste virtually without signs of sentient artifice. The course of the river beyond the city seemed marked by a broad depressed line; while the land assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness, seeming to slope slightly upward as it receded in the mist-hazed west. So far we had made no landing, yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at entering some of the monstrous structures would have been inconceivable. Accordingly we decided to find a smooth place on the foothills near our navigable pass, there grounding the plane and preparing to do some exploration on foot. Though these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of ruins, low flying soon disclosed an ample number of possible landing-places. Selecting that nearest to the pass, since our next flight would be across the great range and back to camp, we succeeded about 12:30 P.M. in coming down on a smooth, hard snowfield wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift and favourable takeoff later on. It did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level; hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged, and that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold. For our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs, and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass, hand camera, light provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist\u2019s hammer and chisel, specimen-bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric torches with extra batteries; this equipment having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take ground pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave."}

Reasons.\n###\nHis elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them\u2014a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongue\u2019s end. About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress."}

Ephraim lived in a half-decayed mansion in Washington Street, Innsmouth, and those who had seen the place (Arkham folk avoid going to Innsmouth whenever they can) declared that the attic windows were always boarded, and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within as evening drew on. The old man was known to have been a prodigious magical student in his day, and legend averred that he could raise or quell storms at sea according to his whim. I had seen him once or twice in my youth as he came to Arkham to consult forbidden tomes at the college library, and had hated his wolfish, saturnine face with its tangle of iron-grey beard. He had died insane\u2014under rather queer circumstances\u2014just before his daughter (by his will made a nominal ward of the principal) entered the Hall School, but she had been his morbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly like him at times. The friend whose daughter had gone to school with Asenath Waite repeated many curious things when the news of Edward\u2019s acquaintance with her began to spread about. Asenath, it seemed, had posed as a kind of magician at school; and had really seemed able to accomplish some highly baffling marvels. She professed to be able to raise thunderstorms, though her seeming success was generally laid to some uncanny knack at prediction. All animals markedly disliked her, and she could make any dog howl by certain motions of her right hand. There were times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very singular\u2014and very shocking\u2014for a young girl; when she would frighten her schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind, and would seem to extract an obscene and zestful irony from her present situation. Most unusual, though, were the well-attested cases of her influence over other persons. She was, beyond question, a genuine hypnotist. By gazing peculiarly at a fellow-student she would often give the latter a distinct feeling of exchanged personality\u2014as if the subject were placed momentarily in the magician\u2019s body and able to stare half across the room at her real body, whose eyes blazed and protruded with an alien expression. Asenath often made wild claims about the nature of consciousness and about its independence of the physical frame\u2014or at least from the life-processes of the physical frame."}

We found it powerful only by slowly increasing the depth and evil of our explorations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon used up of their excitement. Finally, only the more direct stimulation of unnatural personal experiences and adventures remained for us. This terrible emotional need eventually led us to a hateful activity. Even now in my fear, I mention it with shame and nervousness. It was that horrible extreme of human violation: the despised practice of stealing from graves. I can not reveal the details of our shocking trips. I can not list even a part of the worst trophies that decorated the unnamed museum we set up. We prepraed it in the large [THING] [THING] where we lived together, alone. Our museum was a blasphemous, unthinkable place. With the devilish taste of neurotic experts, we had gathered a universe of terror. We did this to excite our tired senses. It was a secret [THING], very far underground. Huge winged demons craved from basalt and onyx were there. They vomited strange geren and orange light from wide, grinning mouths. Hidden air pipes made lnies of red, skeletal things dance. These things were woven [THING] - in - [THING] into large black hangings. The dances were like shifting patterns of death. Through these pipes came smells our moods most desired. Sometimes it was the scent of pale funeral lilies.

There were also tombstones taken from the world 's oledst churchyards. Niches here and there held skulls of all shapes. They also held heads preserved at different stages of decay. There one might find the rotting, bald heads of famous nobles. One might also find the fresh, shining golden heads of recently buried children. Statues and paintings were there. All had fiendish subjects. Some were made by St. John and myself. A locked portfolio, bound in tanned human skin, held certain unknown and unnameable drawings. It was rumored Goya had made them but did not dare admit it. There were sickening musical instruments: string, brass, and woodwind. St. John and I sometimes played them.

I cannot reveal the details of our shocking expeditions, or catalogue even partly the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum we prepared in the great stone house where we jointly dwelt, alone and servantless. Our museum was a blasphemous, unthinkable place, where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we had assembled an universe of terror and decay to excite our jaded sensibilities. It was a secret room, far, far underground; where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light, and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the lines of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black hangings. Through these pipes came at will the odours our moods most craved; sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies, sometimes the narcotic incense of imagined Eastern shrines of the kingly dead, and sometimes\u2014how I shudder to recall it!\u2014the frightful, soul-upheaving stenches of the uncovered grave. Around the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique mummies alternating with comely, life-like bodies perfectly stuffed and cured by the taxidermist\u2019s art, and with headstones snatched from the oldest churchyards of the world.

Their hatred of cats was and growing bolder., no one dared to complain to the couple. This was when Atal, the innkeeper 's son, swore that at dusk he saw all the cats of Ulthar in that yard under the trees. He saw them walking and in a circle around the cottage. They walked two by two, as if performing some animal ceremony. The villagers did not know how to believe from such a boy. They feared the pair had lured the cats to their deaths. They chose not to scold the farmer until they met him outside his dark. Ulthar went to sleep for no result. When the people woke at dawn, look! Every cat was at its home! and,, grey, striped,, and, none was missing. cats appeared and. Tehy purred with contentment. The townspeople discussed the event with each. They were. Old Kranon claimed the travelers had taken the cats. He said cats do not return from the cottage of the man. But everyone agreed on one thing. It was that all the cats refused to eat their meat. Drink their milk. For two days the, cats of Ulthar would touch no food. They slept by the fire or in the sun. A week passed before the villagers noticed no lights appeared at duks in the cottage windows under the trees. the Ntih observed that no one had seen the man. His wife since the night the cats were gone. In another week the mayor decided to face his fears. He decided to visit the house as his duty. He took Shang the blacksmith.

They found a number of beetles crawling in the corners.\n###\nBut Nith, the lean notary, declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold. Still, no one durst complain to the sinister couple; even when little Atal, the innkeeper\u2019s son, vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of Ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees, pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage, two abreast, as if in performance of some unheard-of rite of beasts. The villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death, they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard. So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people awaked at dawn\u2014behold! every cat was back at his accustomed hearth! Large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow, and white, none was missing. Very sleek and fat did the cats appear, and sonorous with purring content. The citizens talked with one another of the affair, and marvelled not a little. Old Kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them, since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife. But all agreed on one thing: that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious. And for two whole days the sleek, lazy cats of Ulthar would touch no food, but only doze by the fire or in the sun. It was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees. Then the lean Nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away. In another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty, though in so doing he was careful to take with him Shang the blacksmith and Thul the cutter of stone as witnesses. And when they had broken down the frail door they found only this: two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor, and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners."}

The White Ship sailed into the mist between the basalt pillars of the West with music playing. The music stopped and the mist celared. We did not see the Lnad of Cathuria. Instead, we saw a fast, powerful sae. Our helpless ship was carried toward an unknown place. The distant sound of falling water reached our ears. Ahead on the far horizon, we saw the huge spray of a giant waterfall. There, the world's oceans drop into a deep nothingness. The bearded man said to us with tears on his cheek, \"We have rejected the beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl. We may never see it again. The gods are greater than men. They have won.\" We closed our eyes before the crash we knew would come. We blocked the sight of the heavelny bird. It flapped its mocking blue wings over the edge of waterfall.\n###\nSo to the sound of melody the White Ship sailed into the mist betwixt the basalt pillars of the West. And when the music ceased and the mist lifted, we beheld not the Land of Cathuria, but a swift-rushing resistless sea, over which our helpless barque was borne toward some unknown goal. Soon to our ears came the distant thunder of falling waters, and to our eyes appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract, wherein the oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness. Then did the bearded man say to me with tears on his cheek: \u201cWe have rejected the beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl, which we may never behold again. The gods are greater than men, and they have conquered.\u201d And I closed my eyes before the crash that I knew would come, shutting out the sight of the celestial bird which flapped its mocking blue wings over the brink of the torrent."}

After the first year, people began to talk about the change in Edward Derby. The talk was casual because the change was only in his mind. But it raised interesting points. Sometimes, Edward was seen with an expression. Doing things that did not match his usual weak nature. For example, in the past he cuold not drive a car. Now he was sometimes seen driving Asenath's powerful Pcakard in. Out of the Crowninshield driveway. He handled the car like an expert. He dealt with traffic problems with a skill. Determination very different from his normal self. At such times, he seemed to have just returned from a trip. To be starting one. No one knew what kind of trip, though he usually took the Innsmouth road.\n###\nIt was after the first year that people began talking about the change in Edward Derby. It was very casual talk, for the change was purely psychological; but it brought up some interesting points. Now and then, it seemed, Edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things wholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature. For example\u2014although in the old days he could not drive a car, he was now seen occasionally to dash into or out of the old Crowninshield driveway with Asenath\u2019s powerful Packard, handling it like a master, and meeting traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his accustomed nature. In such cases he seemed always to be just back from some trip or just starting on one\u2014what sort of trip, no one could guess, although he mostly favoured the Innsmouth road."}

Then we would have to try the next nearest one. That one was less than a mile to the north. The [THING] in between stopped us from trying any of the more southern tunnels on tihs trip. Indeed, if both nearby ones were blocked, it was doubtful if our batteries would allow an attempt on the next northerly one. That one was about a mile beyond our second choice. As we moved our dim way through the maze with map. Compass, we went through rooms. Halls in every state of ruin. We climbed up slopes, crossed upper floors and bridges and climbed down again. We met blocked doorways and piles of wreckage. Now and then we hurried along well - kept and oddly clean sections. We took wrong turns and went back the way we came. In such cases we removed the blind [THING] trail we had left. Once in a while we hit the bottom of an open shaft. Daylight poured or trickled down through it. The carved walls along our path teased us agani and again. Many must have told stories of huge historical importance. Only the hope of later visits made us accept passing them by. As it was, we slowed down now and then and turned on our second torch. If we had more film we would surely have stopped briefly to photograph certain raised carvings. But time - consuming [THING] copying was clearly not possible. I now come again to a place where the wish to pause. To suggest rather than tell, is very strong. It is needed to tell the rest to explain my action in advising against more exploration. We had moved very close to the calculated site of tunnel 's mouth. We had crossed a second - story bridge to what seemed clearly the tip of a pointed [THING]. We went down to a ruined hall especially full of decliningly detailed. Clearly ritual carvings of late work. Then, about 8:30 P.M., Danforth 's sharp young nose gave us the first sign of something odd. If we had a [THING] with us, I guess we would have been warned sooner. At first we could not say exactly what was wrong with the once crystal - clear air. But after a few seconds our memories reacted very clearly. Let me try to say thing without pulling back.\n###\nIn the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one\u2014the one less than a mile to the north. The intervening river-course prevented our trying any of the more southerly tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighbouring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one\u2014about a mile beyond our second choice. As we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and compass\u2014traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation, clambering up ramps, crossing upper floors and bridges and clambering down again, encountering choked doorways and piles of debris, hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches, taking false leads and retracing our way (in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had left), and once in a while striking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or trickled down\u2014we were repeatedly tantalised by the sculptured walls along our route. Many must have told tales of immense historical importance, and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing them by. As it was, we slowed down once in a while and turned on our second torch. If we had had more films we would certainly have paused briefly to photograph certain bas-reliefs, but time-consuming hand copying was clearly out of the question. I come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to hint rather than state, is very strong. It is necessary, however, to reveal the rest in order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration. We had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel\u2019s mouth\u2014having crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall, and descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanship\u2014when, about 8:30 P.M., Danforth\u2019s keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual. If we had had a dog with us, I suppose we would have been warned before. At first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely. Let me try to state the thing without flinching."}

The shadowed lips parted as if to scream a too-terrible sound. That awful, changing face shone without a body. It was bright and again in the darkness. It held more pure, overwhelming, mind-breaking faer than anything else in heaven. Earth has ever shown us. No one spoke. A distant sound grew closer. We followed the mad stare of that remembered face along a cursed bema of to its source. The whining sound also came from that sourc.e For an instant, we saw what it saw. Then we fell. Our ears rang.

No word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer, but as I followed the memory-face\u2019s mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its source, the source whence also the whining came, I too saw for an instant what it saw, and fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking and epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the police.

Most who heard it said the howling was very straneg in volume and quality. Fred Lemdin, the night watchman at Rhodes, says it was mixed with sounds like the screams of a man in great fear. A short and strong thunderstorm seemed to hit near the riverbank. It ended the noise. Bad smells, likely from the oil tanks along the bay, are commonly connected to this event. They may have helped to excite the dogs.\n###\nResidents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd, according to most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours, probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with this incident; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs."}

Poultry turned grey and died very fast. Their meat was dry and smelled bad when cut. Hogs became very fat. Then they suddenly started to change in horrible ways no one could explain. Their meat was useless. Nahum did not know what to do. No country vet would come to his place. The city vet from Arkham was clearly confused. The pigs started to turn grey and become brittle. They fell apart before they died. Their eyes and noses changed strangely. This was very hard to explain because they nevre ate the bad plants. Then the cows got sick. Certain areas or sometimes the whole body would shrink or compress in an unnatural way. Terrible collapses or breakdowns were common. In the final stages, which always ended in death, they turned grey. Brittle like the pigs. Poison was not possible because all cases happened in a locked and untouched barn. No wandering animal's bite could have brought the virus. What living creature can pass through solid walls? It msut be a natural disease. But what disease could cause such results was impossible to guess. By harvest time, no animals were left alive on property. The farm animals and poultry were dead. The dogs had run away. These three dogs all disappeared one night and were never seen again. The five cats had left earlier. Their leaving was hardly noticed because there seemed to be no mice now. Gardner had kept the graceful cats as pets.\n###\nAlmost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced. Poultry turned greyish and died very quickly, their meat being found dry and noisome upon cutting. Hogs grew inordinately fat, then suddenly began to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain. Their meat was of course useless, and Nahum was at his wit\u2019s end. No rural veterinary would approach his place, and the city veterinary from Arkham was openly baffled. The swine began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died, and their eyes and muzzles developed singular alterations. It was very inexplicable, for they had never been fed from the tainted vegetation. Then something struck the cows. Certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled or compressed, and atrocious collapses or disintegrations were common. In the last stages\u2014and death was always the result\u2014there would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs. There could be no question of poison, for all the cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn. No bites of prowling things could have brought the virus, for what live beast of earth can pass through solid obstacles? It must be only natural disease\u2014yet what disease could wreak such results was beyond any mind\u2019s guessing. When the harvest came there was not an animal surviving on the place, for the stock and poultry were dead and the dogs had run away.

It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youth\u2019s mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody. Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Ward\u2019s escape became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waite\u2019s hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on. Ward\u2019s father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised."}

On my left, across a lawn that reached the road. Had a border of - painted stones, stood a house. It was two and a half stories, and for the area. To the right was a group of barns, sheds.

Suddenly, after rounding an obtuse angle at the top of a sharp ascent, the car came to a standstill. On my left, across a well-kept lawn which stretched to the road and flaunted a border of whitewashed stones, rose a white, two-and-a-half-story house of unusual size and elegance for the region, with a congeries of contiguous or arcade-linked barns, sheds, and windmill behind and to the right. I recognised it at once from the snapshot I had received, and was not surprised to see the name of Henry Akeley on the galvanised-iron mail-box near the road. For some distance back of the house a level stretch of marshy and sparsely wooded land extended, beyond which soared a steep, thickly forested hillside ending in a jagged leafy crest. This latter, I knew, was the summit of Dark Mountain, half way up which we must have climbed already. Alighting from the car and taking my valise, Noyes asked me to wait while he went in and notified Akeley of my advent. He himself, he added, had important business elsewhere, and could not stop for more than a moment. As he briskly walked up the path to the house I climbed out of the car myself, wishing to stretch my legs a little before settling down to a sedentary conversation. My feeling of nervousness and tension had risen to a maximum again now that I was on the actual scene of the morbid beleaguering described so hauntingly in Akeley\u2019s letters, and I honestly dreaded the coming discussions which were to link me with such alien and forbidden worlds. Close contact with the utterly bizarre is often more terrifying than inspiring, and it did not cheer me to think that this very bit of dusty road was the place where those monstrous tracks and that foetid green ichor had been found after moonless nights of fear and death. Idly I noticed that none of Akeley\u2019s dogs seemed to be about. Had he sold them all as soon as the Outer Ones made peace with him? Try as I might, I could not have the same confidence in the depth and sincerity of that peace which appeared in Akeley\u2019s final and queerly different letter."}

He knew no quick way of updating it deserved even try. All through late August, he prepared himself with the collected knowledge of data management.

Having understood a of the truths of this place. This place was hinted at by my repeating dream. We turned to that midnight cave. No light from the cliff could reach. We will know what worlds open up beyond distance we went. It was decided secrets are not for people. But there was to hold our attention. We had not gone before the searchlights showed that cursed number of pits. The rats had feasted in these pits. The stop of food had driven the rat army. they turned on the living herds of starving creatures. they burst out from the priory in that wave of destruction. The peasants will forget it. God! Those pits of cut, cleaned bones and opened skulls! Those nightmare holes were filled with the bones of ape - men,, Roman, and English. These bones were from centuries. Some pits were. No one can say how they were. Others were to our searchlights. They were filled with imaginings. I thought, what about the rats? They fell into traps during their searches in this Tartarus? my foot slipped near a edge. I flet a moment of fear. I must have been thinking a time. I could not see anyone in the group except the Capt. Norrys. a sound came from that ink -, boundless distance. I thought I recognized the sound. I saw my cat run past me like a winged god. It went into the hole of the unknown. But I was not. I had no doubt after another second. It was the rushing of those devil - born rats. They are searching for horrors. They were to lead me on. They would lead me to those smiling caves at the earth 's center. Nyarlathotep, the god with no face, howls to the music of two flute players. My searchlight died, but I ran. I heard voices, and howls, and echoes. But above all, that, sneaky rushing sound rose. It rose, rising, like a corpse rises above an river. That river flows under onyx bridges to a, sea.\n###\nOnce I saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of bones, and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyes. Having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this twilit area\u2014an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dream\u2014we turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate. We shall never know what sightless Stygian worlds yawn beyond the little distance we went, for it was decided that such secrets are not good for mankind. But there was plenty to engross us close at hand, for we had not gone far before the searchlights shewed that accursed infinity of pits in which the rats had feasted, and whose sudden lack of replenishment had driven the ravenous rodent army first to turn on the living herds of starving things, and then to burst forth from the priory in that historic orgy of devastation which the peasants will never forget. God! those carrion black pits of sawed, picked bones and opened skulls! Those nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid, Celtic, Roman, and English bones of countless unhallowed centuries! Some of them were full, and none can say how deep they had once been. Others were still bottomless to our searchlights, and peopled by unnamable fancies. What, I thought, of the hapless rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the blackness of their quests in this grisly Tartarus? Once my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink, and I had a moment of ecstatic fear. I must have been musing a long time, for I could not see any of the party but the plump Capt. Norrys. Then there came a sound from that inky, boundless, farther distance that I thought I knew; and I saw my old black cat dart past me like a winged Egyptian god, straight into the illimitable gulf of the unknown. But I was not far behind, for there was no doubt after another second. It was the eldritch scurrying of those fiend-born rats, always questing for new horrors, and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of earth\u2019s centre where Nyarlathotep, the mad faceless god, howls blindly to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute-players. My searchlight expired, but still I ran. I heard voices, and yowls, and echoes, but above all there gently rose that impious, insidious scurrying; gently rising, rising, as a stiff bloated corpse gently rises above an oily river that flows under endless onyx bridges to a black, putrid sea."}

At times, we believed we were truly going insane. Was there a special type of false belief that affects people who have lost their memory? Conceivably, the subconscious mind tries to fill a confusing gap with false memories. This might cause strange and imaginative ideas. This was belief of many mental health doctors who helped us look for similar cases. They shared our confusion about the exact similarities we sometimes found. They did not call condition true insanity. Instead, they classified it as a nervous disorder. Our course of trying to find. Study it, instead of trying to ignore. Forget it, they fully agreed was correct. They said it followed the best psychological rules.

In the narrow hall, outside the locked door with the covered keyhole, he often heard sounds. Thees sounds filled him with a fear he could not explain. It was a fear of vague wonder and deep mystery.

The nightmare shape of Brown Jenkin began to be accompanied by a blur. This blur grew and to look like a woman. This addition upset him tahn he could explain. But he decided it was like an crone. He had met her in the tangle of lanes near the abandoned wharves. On those times, the evil, mocking. stare of the woman had made him. This was the time., an rat darting across the mouth of a alley made him think of Brown Jenkin., he thought, those fears were being reflected in his disordered dreams. He could not deny that the influence of the house was. But traces of his interest kept him. He argued that the fever was for his fantasies. When the fever lessened, he would be from the visions. Those visions,, were of vividness and convincingness. Whenever he awoke, he kept a sense of having gone through than he remembered. He was that in dreams he had talked with both Brown Jenkin. The woman. They had been urging him to go with them. They wanted him to meet a being of power. Toward the end of March he began to improve in his mathematics. But studies bothered him and. He was getting an skill for solving equations. He astonished Professor Upham by his understanding of - and problems. These problems had defeated all the rest of the class. One afteronon there was a discussion. It was about freakish curves in space. It was about points of approach or contact. These points would be between our part of the cosmos and regions. These regions could be as the stars. The gaps between galaxies themselves. They could be as the units beyond the space - time continuum. Gilman 's handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration. though some of his examples caused gossip. There was plenty of gossip about his and oddness. What made the students shake their heads was his theory. The theory was that a man might step from the earth to any body. This would require knowledge beyond all likelihood of gaining. That body would lie at one of an number of points in the pattern.\n###\nIt was in March when the fresh element entered his lighter preliminary dreaming, and the nightmare shape of Brown Jenkin began to be companioned by the nebulous blur which grew more and more to resemble a bent old woman. This addition disturbed him more than he could account for, but finally he decided that it was like an ancient crone whom he had twice actually encountered in the dark tangle of lanes near the abandoned wharves. On those occasions the evil, sardonic, and seemingly unmotivated stare of the beldame had set him almost shivering\u2014especially the first time, when an overgrown rat darting across the shadowed mouth of a neighbouring alley had made him think irrationally of Brown Jenkin. Now, he reflected, those nervous fears were being mirrored in his disordered dreams. That the influence of the old house was unwholesome, he could not deny; but traces of his early morbid interest still held him there. He argued that the fever alone was responsible for his nightly phantasies, and that when the touch abated he would be free from the monstrous visions. Those visions, however, were of abhorrent vividness and convincingness, and whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than he remembered. He was hideously sure that in unrecalled dreams he had talked with both Brown Jenkin and the old woman, and that they had been urging him to go somewhere with them and to meet a third being of greater potency. Toward the end of March he began to pick up in his mathematics, though other studies bothered him increasingly. He was getting an intuitive knack for solving Riemannian equations, and astonished Professor Upham by his comprehension of fourth-dimensional and other problems which had floored all the rest of the class. One afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space, and of theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or the trans-galactic gulfs themselves\u2014or even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole Einsteinian space-time continuum. Gilman\u2019s handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration, even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary eccentricity. What made the students shake their heads was his sober theory that a man might\u2014given mathematical knowledge admittedly beyond all likelihood of human acquirement\u2014step deliberately from the earth to any other celestial body which might lie at one of an infinity of specific points in the cosmic pattern."}

I came only just short of echoing his cry myself; for I had seen those primal sculptures, too, and had shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had suggested that hideous slime-coating found on certain incomplete and prostrate Old Ones\u2014those whom the frightful shoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of re-subjugation.

These inspections, together with the diligent probings which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the technical lore which at last crowded the efficient operation from the office worker\u2019s mind; and illustrate the mechanical chaos upon which fell, in that fateful afternoon of the month\u2019s end, the misfortunes that came to such strange and exasperating recurrence."}

There is snowy Kingsport with its old weather vanes. Steeples, roof ridges. Small bridges, willow trees. There are endless mazes of steep, narrow, winding streets. There is a high central peak with a church on top that time dared not touch. Three are constant puzzles of old colonail houses piled. Scattered at all angles. Heights like a child's messy blocks. Old age seems to folat on grey wings over winter-white gable and gambrel roofs. Fanlights and small-window panes begin to shine one by one in the cold dusk. They join Orion and the ancient stars. The sea is heard pounding against the rotting docks. It is the secret, ancient sea from which the people had come long ago.\n###\nThen beyond the hill\u2019s crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples, ridgepoles and chimney-pots, wharves and small bridges, willow-trees and graveyards; endless labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets, and dizzy church-crowned central peak that time durst not touch; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a child\u2019s disordered blocks; antiquity hovering on grey wings over winter-whitened gables and gambrel roofs; fanlights and small-paned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join Orion and the archaic stars. And against the rotting wharves the sea pounded; the secretive, immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder time."}

As I waited on the rough, mossy rock that served as a step, I looked at the nearby windows. The galss above the door. I noticed that. They were old, loose. Almost blocked by dirt, they were not broken. The building, then, must still be lived in, despite its isolation and general neglect. However, my knocking got no answer. So after knocking again, I tried the rusty latch and found the door unlocked. Inside was a little entrance hall. The plaster was falling from the walls. Through the doorway came a faint but strangely hateful smell. I entered, carrying my bicycle, and closed the door behind me. Ahead rsoe a narrow staircase. Next to it was a small door, probably leading to the cellar. To the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor. Leaning my bicycle against the wall, I opened the door on the left. I walked into a small room with a low ceiling. It was dimly lit by its two dusty windows. It was furnished in the simplest and most basic way posisble. It seemed to be a kind of sitting room, for it had a table. There was a large fireplace. Above it, an old clock ticked on a mantel. Books and papers were very few. In the general gloom, I could not easily read the titles. What interested me was the consistent feeling of great age shown in every visible detail. Most houses in this area I had found were full of objects from the past. But here, the oldness was curiously complete. In the whole room, I could not find a single item clearly made after the revolutionary war. Had the furniture had been less plain, the place would have been a collector's dream. As I looked at this odd room, I felt an increase in the dislike first caused by the house's bleak outside. Just what I faered or hated, I could not say. Something in whole atmosphere seemed full of unholy age, unpleasant crudeness. Secrets that should be forgotten. I did not want to sit down. I walked around examining the various objects I had noticed. The first thing that made me curious was a medium-sized book lying on the table. Ancient that I was surprised to see it outside a museum.\n###\nTherefore instead of trying the door I knocked, feeling as I did so a trepidation I could scarcely explain. As I waited on the rough, mossy rock which served as a doorstep, I glanced at the neighbouring windows and the panes of the transom above me, and noticed that although old, rattling, and almost opaque with dirt, they were not broken. The building, then, must still be inhabited, despite its isolation and general neglect. However, my rapping evoked no response, so after repeating the summons I tried the rusty latch and found the door unfastened. Inside was a little vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling, and through the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odour. I entered, carrying my bicycle, and closed the door behind me. Ahead rose a narrow staircase, flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar, while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor. Leaning my cycle against the wall I opened the door at the left, and crossed into a small low-ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way. It appeared to be a kind of sitting-room, for it had a table and several chairs, and an immense fireplace above which ticked an antique clock on a mantel. Books and papers were very few, and in the prevailing gloom I could not readily discern the titles. What interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every visible detail. Most of the houses in this region I had found rich in relics of the past, but here the antiquity was curiously complete; for in all the room I could not discover a single article of definitely post-revolutionary date. Had the furnishings been less humble, the place would have been a collector\u2019s paradise. As I surveyed this quaint apartment, I felt an increase in that aversion first excited by the bleak exterior of the house. Just what it was that I feared or loathed, I could by no means define; but something in the whole atmosphere seemed redolent of unhallowed age, of unpleasant crudeness, and of secrets which should be forgotten. I felt disinclined to sit down, and wandered about examining the various articles which I had noticed. The first object of my curiosity was a book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an antediluvian aspect that I marvelled at beholding it outside a museum or library."}

Lived there that the strange desk came to the office room. It was one of many pieces of messy furniture. These had been gathered there from nearby departments. At first, it only got attention because of its top. The top was clearly made of common oak. Yet it was remarkable for its msesy arrangement and odd shape. It was very different from the normal \"workstation\" or desk of the area. It is odd that. Different from the group of neat. Useful desks, this item did not seem planned at all. It was not modern efficiency or simple design. It was old and original disorder. This is what came to mind when the quiet furniture would appear in the pale morning. It would stare sadly at the fluorescent lights above the ceiling. The lights would flicker. At the same time, it cast its shadows on the floor. It was as if showing some pattern whose meaning it did not itself understand. But except for how it looked, the desk did not suggest any use. Cluttered and covered in dust, it fit with the other ignored furniture. It had come from the lowest kind of storage. It was found as a thrown away item in a forgotten storage closet. It was the only thing left from a reorganization that had passed by destructively. Near the closet, near a rather unusual air duct, had held two broken chairs. They were newly stripped of their padding. They likely were the only remains of its former companions. No one remembered where they came from. Soon, most people forgot them. Indeed, removing the storage closet. Sealing the air duct in a later renovation helped erase even the memory of the place. Acquired by an uncaring manager who had placed it there, the desk was little different from its surroundings in its basic state of being left alone.\n###\nIt was not long after my commencement and habitation that the peculiar desk came to the clerical chamber. One of a numerous collection of disordered furnishings accumulated thither from the neighbouring departments, it at first commanded attention only because of its surface; which though plainly of the common oak type, were yet remarkable for their chaotic array and anomalous conformation, being vastly unlike those of the average \u201cworkstation\u201d or bureau of the locality. It is curious that although it differed so widely from the mass of organised and utilitarian desks, this article gave not the least impression of deliberate design. It was not the modern efficiency or the austere minimalism, but the ancient and primordial chaos, which imagination called to view when the silent furniture would loom in the pallid morning and glare in desolation at the fluorescent bulbs as they flickered above the suspended ceiling, meanwhile casting out its shadows across the floor as if in the manifestation of some pattern whose nature it did not itself comprehend. But save for its appearance, the desk was not in any way suggestive of purpose. Cluttered and dusty, it was at home amongst the other neglected furnishings; having come (so I was afterward told) from the very lowest sort of storage. It had been discovered as a discarded piece in a forgotten storage closet, the only remnant of a reorganisation which had passed lethally by. Near the closet, close to a rather unusual air duct, had lain two broken chairs, newly stripped of their padding, and presumably forming the sole remains of its former companions. No one recalled their provenance, and they were soon forgotten by the many. Indeed, the removal of the storage closet and the sealing of the air duct by a subsequent renovation had helped to efface even the scene from recollection. Acquired by an indifferent manager who had given it its place, the desk differed little from its surroundings in its essential abandonment."}

As I studied my feeling, I saw that it was made of two clear parts. First, allowing that the tool had been clean before. Was still working, the shown change in its state itself was. Hard to think. Second, the change in the hose's own feel, color. Far beyond the normal. The thing's whole look seemed to have gone through a sneaky change. Deep that one could hardly match its two states with the idea that both showed equal soundness. Surface pattern, makeup, all were slightly different. With my home awareness of material decay, I could follow deep differences in its most common reactions. Certainly, the basic disaster. Showing which could make. Total a turn must be a severe one indeed. Yet in another way the hose seemed quite typical of its past self. The same old ability for carrying, the same old bendy use. I could not for a moment. More than moment, believe the idea of unfixable ruin. Evil falling apart. Did did not the action, the readiness to have me check the truth of its flow myself, prove its lasting realness?\n###\nThe hose seemed so unlike anything which could have been expected! As I analysed my impression, I saw that it consisted of two distinct phases. First, granting that the implement had been pristine before and was still functional, the indicated change in its condition itself was so swift and unthinkable. And secondly, the change in the hose\u2019s own texture, hue, and character was so vastly beyond the normal or the predictable. The object\u2019s whole aspect seemed to have undergone an insidious mutation\u2014a mutation so deep that one could scarcely reconcile its two states with the supposition that both represented equal integrity. Surface-pattern, composition\u2014all were subtly different. And with my domestic sensitiveness to material decay, I could trace profound divergences in its commonest reactions and moisture-responses. Certainly, the elemental cataclysm or exposure which could produce so radical an overturn must be an extreme one indeed! Yet in another way the hose seemed quite characteristic of its former self. The same old capacity for conveyance\u2014the same old pliable utility. I could not a moment\u2014or more than a moment\u2014credit the idea of irreparable corruption or malign disintegration. Did not the performance\u2014the willingness to have me test the truth of its flow in person\u2014prove its enduring genuineness?"}

Olney, looking dry. Light on his feet, climbed down from the cliffs to ancient Kingsport. His eyes held the look of faraway places. He could not remember what he had dreamed in the [THING] - high hut of that still unnamed hermit. He could not say how he had climbed donw that cliff, which no other feet had traveled. Nor could he speak of these things at all, except with the Terrible Old Man. The Terrible Old Man later muttered strange things in his long white beard. He claimed the [THING] who came down from that cliff was not entirely the [THING] who went up. He said that somewhere under that grey peaked roof. Within unimaginable stretches of that sinister white mist, the lost spirit of Thomas Olney still remained. Ever since that hour, through long dull years of greyness. Tiredness, the philosopher has worked, eaten, slept. Done the proper deeds of a citizen without complaint. He no longer longs for the magic of distant hills. He no longer sighs for secrets that peer like green reefs from a bottomless [THING]. The sameness of his days no longer saddens him. Well - trained thoughts are now enough for his imagination. His good wife grows stouter. His children grow older, more ordinary, and more useful. He never fails to smile with correct pride when needed. His eyes hold no restless light. If he ever listens for solemn bells. Distant fairy horns, it is only at night when old dreams wander. He has never seen Kingsport again. His family disliked the odd old houses and complained the drains were terribly bad. They now have a neat bungalow at Bristol Highlands, where no tall cliffs tower. The neighbors are [THING] - like. But in Kingsport, strange stories are spreading. Even the Terrible Old Man admits to something his grandfather never told. For now, when the [THING] blows loudly from the north past the high ancient [THING] that seems part of the [THING], the ominous, brooding silence is finlaly broken. That silence was once the curse of Kingsport 's seaside villagers. Old [THING] tell of pleasant voices heard singing there. They tell of laughter that swells with joys beyond earthly joys. They say that at evening, the little low windows are brighter than before.\n###\nAnd at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as Olney, dry and light-footed, climbed down from the cliffs to antique Kingsport with the look of far places in his eyes. He could not recall what he had dreamed in the sky-perched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet. Nor could he talk of these matters at all save with the Terrible Old Man, who afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the man who came down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up, and that somewhere under that grey peaked roof, or amidst inconceivable reaches of that sinister white mist, there lingered still the lost spirit of him who was Thomas Olney. And ever since that hour, through dull dragging years of greyness and weariness, the philosopher has laboured and eaten and slept and done uncomplaining the suitable deeds of a citizen. Not any more does he long for the magic of farther hills, or sigh for secrets that peer like green reefs from a bottomless sea. The sameness of his days no longer gives him sorrow, and well-disciplined thoughts have grown enough for his imagination. His good wife waxes stouter and his children older and prosier and more useful, and he never fails to smile correctly with pride when the occasion calls for it. In his glance there is not any restless light, and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering. He has never seen Kingsport again, for his family disliked the funny old houses, and complained that the drains were impossibly bad. They have a trim bungalow now at Bristol Highlands, where no tall crags tower, and the neighbours are urban and modern. But in Kingsport strange tales are abroad, and even the Terrible Old Man admits a thing untold by his grandfather. For now, when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous brooding silence ever before the bane of Kingsport\u2019s maritime cotters. And old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth\u2019s joys; and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly."}

Around the second week in July, another one of our letters went missing. We learned this from an anxious message from Akeley. After that, he told us not to send mail to Townshend anymore. Instead, we should send all mail to the General Delivery at Brattleboro. He would go there often by car. By the motor-coach line that replaced the slow branch railway. We could see he was getting more anxious. He gave many details about incraesed dog barking on moonless nights. He also told about fresh claw-prints sometimes fuond on the road. In the mud behind our farmyard in the morning. Once he described a whole line of prints facing a line of dog tracks. He sent a very distrubing photo as proof. This happened after a night when the dogs barked and howled a lot.\n###\nAbout this time\u2014the second week in July\u2014another letter of mine went astray, as I learned through an anxious communication from Akeley. After that he told me to address him no more at Townshend, but to send all mail in care of the General Delivery at Brattleboro; whither he would make frequent trips either in his car or on the motor-coach line which had lately replaced passenger service on the lagging branch railway. I could see that he was getting more and more anxious, for he went into much detail about the increased barking of the dogs on moonless nights, and about the fresh claw-prints he sometimes found in the road and in the mud at the back of his farmyard when morning came. Once he told about a veritable army of prints drawn up in a line facing an equally thick and resolute line of dog-tracks, and sent a loathsomely disturbing kodak picture to prove it. That was after a night on which the dogs had outdone themselves in barking and howling."}

Oldest of all are the great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hill-tops, but these are more generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizeable table-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in believing the remains Caucasian. It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5 A.M. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might\u2014and did\u2014speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future. Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old Whateley\u2019s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular."}

This made the listener clearly see the damp Cyclopean city made of sliym green stone. He strangely said its shape was all wrong. It also made the listener fearfully hear the constant, half-mental call from underground: \"Cthulhu fhtagn\", \"Cthulhu fhtagn\". These words were part of that fearful ritual. The ritual spoke of dead Cthulhu dreaming in his stone tomb at R'lyeh. The writer was deeply affected, even though he believed in reason. The researcher was sure Wilcox had heard about the cult in some casual way. He had soon forgotten it among all his other strange reading and ideas. Later, because it was so impressive, it had come out in his subconscious. This showed in his dreams, in the carved relief. In the terrible statue the listener now saw. So, his trick on the writer's uncle had been very innocent. The young man was a type that was both a bit pretentious. A bit rude. The researcher could never like such a person.

The climax? What simple science story can claim such a dramatic effect? One just wrote down some things that seemed like facts to the observer. The reader can interpret them as one wishes. As already said, the narrator's boss, Dr. Fenton, says none of what was told is real. It is said the witness was exhausted from stress. He badly needed the paid vacation that was kindly given. Assurance is offered on professional honor that Joe Slater was only a low-grade paranoid. His wild ideas must have come from rough folk tale.s Such tales exist even in the most fallen communities. All this is told. Yet what was seen in the sky the night after Slater died cannot be forgotten. If the witness is thought biased, someone else must add this final statement. It might supply the expected climax. The next report about the star Nova Persei is qouted word for word. It is from the famous astronomy expert, Prof. Garrett P. Serviss:.\n###\nThe climax? What plain tale of science can boast of such a rhetorical effect? I have merely set down certain things appealing to me as facts, allowing you to construe them as you will.

He vows that I was broken down with nervous strain, and badly in need of the long vacation on full pay which he so generously gave me. He assures me on his professional honour that Joe Slater was but a low-grade paranoiac, whose fantastic notions must have come from the crude hereditary folk-tales which circulate in even the most decadent of communities.

Lest you think me a biassed witness, another\u2019s pen must add this final testimony, which may perhaps supply the climax you expect.

Growing older made his uncle tell him the stored knowledge he wanted. A very strange story lay before him. Some of material was long, full of numbers, and boring family hitsory. But a constant feeling of deep, lasting horror and supernatural evil ran through it. This impressed him even more than it had impressed the good doctor. Separate events fit together in a strange way. Seemingly unimportant details contained many terrible possibilities. A new and strong curiosity gerw in him. His boyish curiosity was weak and undeveloped in comparison. The first discovery led to a complete research. Finally, it led to that frightening search that was. Disastrous for him. At last, his uncle insisted on joining the search he had started. After a certain night in that hous,e he did not leave with him. He is lonely without that gentle person. His long years were filled only with honor, virtue, good taste, kindness, and learning. He has built a marble urn in his memory in St. John's churchyard. That is the place Poe loved. It is a hidden group of large willow trees on the hill. Headstones sit quietly there between the old church. Bank walls of Benefit Street.\n###\nWhen, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from my uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enough chronicle. Long-winded, statistical, and drearily genealogical as some of the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding, tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me even more than it had impressed the good doctor. Separate events fitted together uncannily, and seemingly irrelevant details held mines of hideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate. The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to that shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine.

The observer was deepyl shaekn by a mental change he had never experienced before. He decided to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo. Because he was looking for London, he immediately got back on a ship to the capital city of Norwegian. He arrived on an autumn day at the clean docks near the Egeberg. He found that Johansen's address was in the Old Town area of King Harold Haardrada. This area kept the name of Oslo alive. The larger city had been called \"Christiana\" for centuries. He took a short taxi ride. He knocked at the door of a neat, old building with a plaster front. His heart was beating fast. A sad woman in black answered the door. She spoke broken English. She told him that Gustaf Johansen was dead. This stung him with disappointment.\n###\nShaken with such a mental revolution as I had never before known, I now resolved to visit Mate Johansen in Oslo.

The bright light from outside the window clearly threw his shadow onto the chimney above the fireplace. Our eyes had been fixed on that spot.

Sometimes, as he became more desperate. Surrounde,d the driver would enter this whirl of tall buildings, broken curbs, steep alleys, bent fire hydrants, gloomy walkers. He would wind from one narrow street to another, looking for those rare spots where other cars still allwoed passage. Move ahead through tihs blocked maze past the grim 19th-century storage building.s The tight square in the financial area, where the old bank building still stands firm on its settled base. In that square he would stop to think about the scary shape of the job ahead, as it showed itself in that small space between a delivery truck. An old-model car, limited by its two hard bumpers. Topped by the evil shine of a parking meter like a grave is topped by a burial lamp. He mostly liked to try this move in the late afternoon, when the fading light sihnes with a bad copper color on meter. The nearyb fenders. Throws strange shadows around the sleeping cars which always take the best spots. After a long thought he would grow almost weak with a driver's fear for the task. Then he would start the approach in the growing dark past the staring eyes of other drivers.

In that plaza he would pause to contemplate the terrifying geometry of the task before him, as it presented itself in that narrow gap between a delivery van and a sedan of antique make, bounded by its two unyielding bumpers and crowned by the baleful gleam of a parking meter as a tomb is crowned by a sepulchral lamp. He liked mostly to attempt this maneuver in the late afternoon, when the failing luminescence glints with a sinister copper hue upon the meter and the adjacent fenders and hubcaps, and casts unnatural shadows around the dreaming vehicles which forever occupy the prime locations. After a long calculation he would grow almost faint with a driver\u2019s dread for the undertaking, and then he would initiate the approach in the gathering gloom past the unblinking eyes of other motorists and through the tense, claustrophobic ritual where amber indicators would begin to flash their cyclopean warnings from behind and before, glimpsed through mirrors set high over confounding arrays of gauges with cryptic illuminated symbols."}

He made people with his stories about chemical research. stories began to spread. They were about lights burning all night., the lights stopped burning. stories started. They were meat orders from the butcher. There were stories of muffled shouting, speaking, chanting, and screaming. These sounds seemed to come from a cellar under the place., the and household was disliked by the people. It is not that hints were made. These hints connected the hated place with the outbreak of vamipre - attacks and murders. This was since the arae of that plague seemed to Pawtuxet. The streets of Edgewood. Ward spent of his time at the bungalow. He slept at home. He was considered a resident in his father 's house. he was from the city on trips lasting a week. The destinations of these trips are. He grew and than. He seemed when repeating his story to Dr. Willett. His story was about research and discoveries. Willett waited for him at his father 's house. The Ward was and. He wanted his son to have supervision as. This was because his son was and. The doctor insists the man was at this time. He mentions conversations to prove his point. About September the vampirism decreased. But in the following January Ward he was involved in trouble. For some time, people had talked about trucks arriving. Leaving at night at the Pawtuxet bungalow. At this point, an problem revealed the nature of one item they carried. In a spot near Hope Valley, one of the robberies of trucks happened. \" Hi - jackers \" were looking for liquor shipments. This time, the robbers were destined to get the shock. The cases they took proved to contain things when opened. that the matter could not be kept among the underworld. The thieves buried what they found. But when the State Police heard about it, a search was conducted.\n###\nWard himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research. Before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butcher\u2019s and of the muffled shouting, declamation, rhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of Edgewood. Ward spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his father\u2019s roof. Twice he was absent from the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have not yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to Dr. Willett his old, old story of vital research and future revelations. Willett often waylaid him at his father\u2019s house, for the elder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his point. About September the vampirism declined, but in the following January Ward almost became involved in serious trouble. For some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents. In a lonely spot near Hope Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylayings of trucks by \u201chi-jackers\u201d in quest of liquor shipments, but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock. For the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State Police got wind of the matter a careful search was made."}

Also, the landscape we mvoed through had a strange, calming beauty. It felt llike a cosmic scene. Time was lost in the maze behind us. Around us were only beautiful, flowering ffields. It was like the recovered beauty of past centuries. There were anciient groves and pure pastures. The pastures had bright autumn flowers along their edge.s There were small brown farms at wide intervals. They nestled among huge trees. Below them were steep cliffs covered in sweet brier and grass. Even the sunlight had a magical glow. It seemed like a special air covered the whole area. I had never seen anything like it before. I had onyl seen such views in the pianted backgrounds of Italian's eearly works. Sodoma and Leonardo imagined such wide views. But they only showed them far away, seen through the arches of Renaissance arcades. We were now moving right through the middle of such a picture. I felt its magic was something I knew deep inside.

I had seen nothing like it before save in the magic vistas that sometimes form the backgrounds of Italian primitives. Sodoma and Leonardo conceived such expanses, but only in the distance, and through the vaultings of Renaissance arcades.

Examining one day the reserve specimens, my eye was caught by an picture. The specimens were set on the storage shelves. They were in a room of the museum.

It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp. Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows: MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA. Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow. One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow. The Morrison Co.\u2019s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34\u00b0 21', W. Longitude 152\u00b0 17' with one living and one dead man aboard. The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern. This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men."}

They planned to use it later in talks with others. But the rescued three people remembered its effect on them in Dyltah-Leen. They warned their group not to taste any of it. There was a large amount of rubies from moon mines in a vault near the water. They were both ruogh and polished. Wehn the ghouls found they were not good to eat, they lost all interest in them. Carter did not try to take any away. He knew too much about those who had mined them. Suddenly there came an excited sound from guards on the docks. All the disgusting gatherers stopped their work. They looked out to sea and gathered around the water's edge. Betwixt the grey cliffs, a new black shpi was quickly coming closer. It would only be a moment before the almost-human people on deck saw the town was invaded. They would warn the terrible things below. Fortunately the ghouls still carried the spears and javelins which Carter had given them. At his order, supported by the being that was Pickman, they now formed a battle line. They got ready to stop the ship frmo landing. Presently a burst of noise on the ship told that the crew had seen the changed situation. The ship stopped right away. This showed the ghouls' larger numbers had been seen and considered. After a short pause, the new people silently turned. Went back out between the cliffs. But the ghouls did not think for a moment that the fight was avoided. Either the dark ship would look for more help. Or the crew would try to land somewhere else on the island. A group of scouts was sent right away up to the high point to see what the enemy would do. In just a few minutes, a ghoul came back out of breath. He said the moon-beasts. Almost-humans were landing on the outside of the more eastern rugged grey cliff. They were climbing by hidden paths. Ledegs which even a goat could hardly walk on safely. Almost right after that, the ship was seen again through the narrow strait. But only for a second. Then, a few moments later, a second messenger ran down from above. He said another group was landing on the other cliff. Both groups were much bigger than the ship's size should allow.\n###\nThey had also found a hogshead of potent moon-wine, and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings, though the rescued trio, remembering its effect on them in Dylath-Leen, had warned their company to taste none of it. Of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store, both rough and polished, in one of the vaults near the water; but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them. Carter did not try to carry any away, since he knew too much about those which had mined them. Suddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves, and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront. Betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing, and it could be but a moment before the almost-humans on deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give the alarm to the monstrous things below. Fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which Carter had distributed amongst them; and at his command, sustained by the being that was Pickman, they now formed a line of battle and prepared to prevent the landing of the ship. Presently a burst of excitement on the galley told of the crew\u2019s discovery of the changed state of things, and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account. After a moment of hesitation the newcomers silently turned and passed out between the headlands again, but not for an instant did the ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted. Either the dark ship would seek reinforcements, or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island; hence a party of scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemy\u2019s course would be. In a very few minutes a ghoul returned breathless to say that the moon-beasts and almost-humans were landing on the outside of the more easterly of the rugged grey headlands, and ascending by hidden paths and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety. Almost immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the flume-like strait, but only for a second. Then, a few moments later, a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other headland; both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would seem to allow for."}

This view showed moonlit roofs and city lights. Only this difficult musician amogn residents of Rue d'Auseil could see it. I walked to the wwindow. I was going to pull back the plain curtains.

I moved toward the window and would have drawn aside the nondescript curtains, when with a frightened rage even greater than before the dumb lodger was upon me again; this time motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag me thither with both hands. Now thoroughly disgusted with my host, I ordered him to release me, and told him I would go at once. His clutch relaxed, and as he saw my disgust and offence his own anger seemed to subside. He tightened his relaxing grip, but this time in a friendly manner; forcing me into a chair, then with an appearance of wistfulness crossing to the littered table, where he wrote many words with a pencil in the laboured French of a foreigner."}

Iranon had been when Iranon found him watching for budding branches in Teloth beside the stone - banked Zuro. one night with a moon, the travelers reached a mountain top. They looked down upon the lights of Oonai. Peasants had told them they were. Iranon knew this was not his home city of Aira. The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira. They were and. The lights of Aira shine. as the moonlight shone on the floor by the window., Iranon 's mother rocked him to sleep with a song.\n###\nAnd the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I wandered to many other cities. I have seen Stethelos that is below the great cataract, and have gazed on the marsh where Sarnath once stood. I have been to Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai, and have dwelt long in Olatho\u00eb in the land of Lomar. But though I have had listeners sometimes, they have ever been few, and I know that welcome shall await me only in Aira, the city of marble and beryl where my father once ruled as King. So for Aira shall we seek, though it were well to visit distant and lute-blessed Oonai across the Karthian hills, which may indeed be Aira, though I think not. Aira\u2019s beauty is past imagining, and none can tell of it without rapture, whilst of Oonai the camel-drivers whisper leeringly.\u201d At the sunset Iranon and small Romnod went forth from Teloth, and for long wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests. The way was rough and obscure, and never did they seem nearer to Oonai the city of lutes and dancing; but in the dusk as the stars came out Iranon would sing of Aira and its beauties and Romnod would listen, so that they were both happy after a fashion. They ate plentifully of fruit and red berries, and marked not the passing of time, but many years must have slipped away. Small Romnod was now not so small, and spoke deeply instead of shrilly, though Iranon was always the same, and decked his golden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods. So it came to pass one day that Romnod seemed older than Iranon, though he had been very small when Iranon had found him watching for green budding branches in Teloth beside the sluggish stone-banked Zuro. Then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked down upon the myriad lights of Oonai. Peasants had told them they were near, and Iranon knew that this was not his native city of Aira. The lights of Oonai were not like those of Aira; for they were harsh and glaring, while the lights of Aira shine as softly and magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window where Iranon\u2019s mother once rocked him to sleep with song."}

Older age has more forgiveness for these incomplete but noble peopel. Their worst real fault is timidity. They are finally punished by public laughter for their intellectual mistakes. Mistakes like Ptolemaism, Calvinism, being against Darwinism, being against Nietzscheism. Every kind of Sabbatarianism. Laws limiting spending. West, though despite his amazing scientific knowledge, had patience with Dr. Halsey and his learned coworkers. He held a growing anger, along with a wish to prove his theories to these stupid important people in some striking. Like most men, he enjoyed detailed daydreams of revenge, victory, and finally generous forgiveness. Then the disease came, smiling and deadly, from the nightmare caves of Tartarus. West and I had graduated around the time it satrted. But we had stayed for extra work at the summer school. So we were in Arkham when it hit town with devilish force. We were not yet licensed doctors, but we now had our degrees. As the number of sick people grew, we were desperately pushed into public service. The situation was almost beyond control. People died too often for the local funeral directors to handle fully. Burials without embalming happened quickly one after another. Even the Christchurch Cemetery receiving tomb was filled with coffins of the dead who were not embalmed. This situation affected West, who often thought of the irony. Three weer so many fresh bodies, yet none for his persecuted research! We were terribly overworked. The huge mental and nervous pressure made my friend think darkly. But West's gentle enemies were also worn out with exhausting duties. College had almost closed. Every doctor from the medical school was helping to fight the typhoid plague. Dr. Halsey especially had done very well in sacrificial service. He used his skill with energy on cases many others avoided beacuse of danger. In less than a month, the fearless dean had become a popular hero. He seemed unaware of his fame as he struggled not to collapse from physical tiredness. West could not help but admire the strength of his enemy. Because of this, he was even more set on proving the truth of his amazing ideas to him. Using the disorder of both college work. City health rules, he managed to have a recently dead body secretly brought into the university dissecting-room one night.

West, young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good Dr. Halsey and his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion. Like most youths, he indulged in elaborate day-dreams of revenge, triumph, and final magnanimous forgiveness. And then had come the scourge, grinning and lethal, from the nightmare caverns of Tartarus.

Though not as yet licenced physicians, we now had our degrees, and were pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew. The situation was almost past management, and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle.

Dr. Halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service, applying his extreme skill with whole-hearted energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness. Before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero, though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion. West could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe, but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines. Taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations, he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university dissecting-room one night, and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution."}

Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Orne\u2019s and Hutchinson\u2019s; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise. At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Ward\u2019s immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charles\u2019s normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard\u2019s writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection."}

The ship itself moved with one row of oars with men. It came into view between the cliffs. It stopped in the harbor as if to watch the coming fight. Be for any use. By this time Carter and Pickman had split the ghouls into three groups. One group would meet each of the two attacking forces. One group would stay in the town.

Where the leader of the moon - beast group seemed to be, the ghouls had not done. They were pulling to the slopes of the point.\n###\nAlmost immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the flume-like strait, but only for a second. Then, a few moments later, a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other headland; both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would seem to allow for. The ship itself, moving slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars, soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs, and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any possible use. By this time Carter and Pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties, one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town. The first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective directions, while the third was subdivided into a land party and a sea party. The sea party, commanded by Carter, boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the undermanned galley of the newcomers; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open sea. Carter did not at once pursue it, for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the town. Meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moon-beasts and almost-humans had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky. The thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine, and the general effect of those hybrid, half-amorphous processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toad-like lunar blasphemies. Then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama. Javelins began to fly from both sides, and the swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost-humans gradually joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony. Now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside, in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubbles. For half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky, till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated. On the east cliff, however, where the leader of the moon-beast party appeared to be present, the ghouls had not fared so well; and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper."}

He was a healthy animal without complex thought.s His life processes were probably simple and healthy. Now, with his eyes clsoed, he looked more asleep than dead.

Theories for use on humans. We felt very tense. We knew there was almost no chance for complete success. We could not avoid fears about possible results from partial revival. Especially we were also worried about the creature's mind and urges. After death, some of the more delicate brain cells might have been damaged. We still had some ideas about the traditional \"soul\" of man. We felt awe at the secrets a person back from the dead might tell. We wondered what this calm man might have seen in unreachable places. We wondered what he could say if fully brought back to life. But our wonder was not too strong, because we mostly shared our friend's materialist views. He was calmer than we were.

That link is a grim story in the records of horro.r It tells of the creature Jacques Roulet from Caude. In 1598, he was sentenced to death as possessed by a demon. Later the Pairs parliament saved him from the stake. Put him in a madhouse. He was found in a wood covered with blood and pieces of flesh. This was soon after a boy was killed and torn apart by two wolves. One wolf was seen running away unhurt. Surely a nice fireside tale, with a strange meaning about name and place.

Etienne\u2019s son Paul, a surly fellow whose erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the family, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providence never shared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan neighbours, it was freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at the proper time nor directed toward the proper object. All this had undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins. What relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and other inhabitants of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alone could determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the legends realised that additional link with the terrible which my wide reading had given me; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror which tells of the creature Jacques Roulet, of Caude, who in 1598 was condemned to death as a daemoniac but afterward saved from the stake by the Paris parliament and shut in a madhouse. He had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to lope away unhurt.

Around the second week, Charles started to leave the house for long times. One day, the good ancient black woman Hannah came to help with sprign cleaning. She said he often visited the old house in Olney Court. He would bring a large suitcase and do strange digging in the cellar. He was always very generous to her and to old Asa. But he seemed more worried than before. This made her very sad, because she had wacthed him grow up since birth. Another report about his activities came from Pawtuxet. Some family friends saw him there from a distance many times. He seemed to often go to the resort and canoe-house at Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. Later, Dr. Willett asked questions at that place. He found out that Charles always wanted to get to riverbank, which was rather closed off. He would walk north along it.

He was always very liberal to her and to old Asa, but seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved her very much, since she had watched him grow up from birth. Another report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times.

This was not much, though, for the old woman was spinning very hard, and the aged clock had been striking. After that I lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle, and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume, and sat down on that very bench, so that I could not see him. It was certainly nervous waiting, and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so. When eleven struck, however, the old man stood up, glided to a massive carved chest in a corner, and got two hooded cloaks; one of which he donned, and the other of which he draped round the old woman, who was ceasing her monotonous spinning. Then they both started for the outer door; the woman lamely creeping, and the old man, after picking up the very book I had been reading, beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or mask. Amid these hushed throngs I followed my voiceless guides; jostled by elbows that seemed preternaturally soft, and pressed by chests and stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy; but seeing never a face and hearing never a word. Up, up, up the eerie columns slithered, and I saw that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town, where perched a great white church. I had seen it from the road\u2019s crest when I looked at Kingsport in the new dusk, and it had made me shiver because Aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spire. There was an open space around the church; partly a churchyard with spectral shafts, and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind, and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables. Death-fires danced over the tombs, revealing gruesome vistas, though queerly failing to cast any shadows. Past the churchyard, where there were no houses, I could see over the hill\u2019s summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour, though the town was invisible in the dark. Only once in a while a lanthorn bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church."}

Robed, shuffling shape beolw it. I decided there was no reason I should have felt that shaking touch of memory. Was it not taht a group should use a type of head covering as part of its uniforms? This head covering would be known to the community in some man without what I had started to call the \" Innsmouth look. \" I decided not to ask him any of the questions that bothered me. I remembered that things had been noticed in this hotel., I walked out into the square. The bus had left. I studied the scene and with judgmetn. One side of stone - paved area was the line of the river. The side was a - circle of brick buildings with slanted roofs from around the 1800s. streets went from them to the,, and southwest. The streetlights were and \u2014 all - power bulbs. I was my plans required me to leave, though I knew the moon would be.\n###\nThis, acting on my imagination, had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed, shambling form beneath it. There was not, I soon decided, any reason why I should have felt that shuddering touch of evil pseudo-memory. Was it not natural that a local mystery cult should adopt among its regimentals an unique type of head-dress made familiar to the community in some strange way\u2014perhaps as treasure-trove? A very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking youngish people now became visible on the sidewalks\u2014lone individuals, and silent knots of two or three. The lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harboured small shops with dingy signs, and I noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along. The sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct, and presently I saw a fairly deep river-gorge ahead, spanned by a wide, iron-railed highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out. As we clanked over the bridge I looked out on both sides and observed some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part way down. The water far below was very abundant, and I could see two vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least one downstream on my left. From this point the noise was quite deafening. Then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the right-hand side in front of a tall, cupola-crowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a half-effaced sign proclaiming it to be the Gilman House. I was glad to get out of that bus, and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby. There was only one person in sight\u2014an elderly man without what I had come to call the \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d\u2014and I decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me; remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel. Instead, I strolled out on the square, from which the bus had already gone, and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly. One side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of the river; the other was a semicircle of slant-roofed brick buildings of about the 1800 period, from which several streets radiated away to the southeast, south, and southwest. Lamps were depressingly few and small\u2014all low-powered incandescents\u2014and I was glad that my plans called for departure before dark, even though I knew the moon would be bright."}

Bewilderment was on top. I could hardly remember which towels were washed. Which were still dirty. Then memory slowly came back. I knew I had seen tasks more boring than I had imagined. With Sitting down, I tried to guess, as much as housework would let me, what had happened. I tried to guess how I might end the sameness, if it really had to be endured. It seemed not to have Substance, nor shape, nor any quality a household mind colud think of. What could it be, then, but some household vapor? What but some sleep-causing bad ai,r like Provdience housekeepers tell stories about? They say it stays over certain linen closets. I felt this was the clue. I looked again at the basket on floor. The towels and washcloths had taken strange shapes there. In ten minuets, I made my decision. Taking my apron, I set out for the cupboard. There I measured, sorted, and wrote down an order. I ordered a pressing cloth, a seam roller, a surgical mask. Six large bottles of lavender water. All were to be delivered the next morning at the closet door of the avoided laundry in Benefit Street.

Substance it seemed not to possess, nor form, nor any quality conceivable by the household mind. What, then, but some domestic emanation; some soporific miasma such as Providence housekeepers tell of as lingering over certain linen closets?

House in a fit of extreme anger. The observer knew he now stayed mostly in the attic lab with that cursed electrical machine. He ate little and kept even the servants out. The observer did not think a short ten weeks could change. Ruin a human. It is not nice to see heavy man suddenly become thni. It is worse when the loose skin turns yellwo or gray. The eyes sink in, have circles, and glow strangely. The forehead has veins and wrinkles. The hands shake and twitch. If you add to this a disgusting messiness, wild messy clothes, thick dark hair with white roots. A full white beard on a once clean-shaven face, the total effect is very shocking. This was how Crawford Tillinghast looked on the night his confused message brought the observer to his door after his weeks away. This was the ghost that shook as it let the observer in. It held a candle.

I had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine, eating little and excluding even the servants, but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature. It is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or greyed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily glowing, the forehead veined and corrugated, and the hands tremulous and twitching. And if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness; a wild disorder of dress, a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots, and an unchecked growth of pure white beard on a face once clean-shaven, the cumulative effect is quite shocking. But such was the aspect of Crawford Tillinghast on the night his half-coherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile; such the spectre that trembled as it admitted me, candle in hand, and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient, lonely house set back from Benevolent Street."}

My anger was. my sense stopped me from going into a. That place might be the home of some sea monster. It might be a maze of passages from which I could escape. All I could do was turn on the fading searchlight of the U-29. With its help, I walked up the temple steps and studied the carvings. The beam of light went through the door at an angle. I looked to see if I could see anything. But I saw nothing. Not the roof was. I tested the floor with a staff and took a step or two. I did not dare go., for the time in my life, I felt the emotion of fear. I began to understand how some of Klenze 's moods had started. The temple attracted me and. Yet I feared its depths with a and growing terror. Returning to the submarine, I turned off the lights and sat thinking in the drak. Electricity must be saved for emergencies.

I regretted the lack of planning that made us use up the candles we carried.\n###\nOn the 17th, as my impulse to search out the mystery of the temple waxed still more insistent, a great disappointment befell me; for I found that the materials needed to replenish the portable light had perished in the mutiny of those pigs in July. My rage was unbounded, yet my German sense forbade me to venture unprepared into an utterly black interior which might prove the lair of some indescribable marine monster or a labyrinth of passages from whose windings I could never extricate myself. All I could do was to turn on the waning searchlight of the U-29, and with its aid walk up the temple steps and study the exterior carvings. The shaft of light entered the door at an upward angle, and I peered in to see if I could glimpse anything, but all in vain. Not even the roof was visible; and though I took a step or two inside after testing the floor with a staff, I dared not go farther. Moreover, for the first time in my life I experienced the emotion of dread. I began to realise how some of poor Klenze\u2019s moods had arisen, for as the temple drew me more and more, I feared its aqueous abysses with a blind and mounting terror. Returning to the submarine, I turned off the lights and sat thinking in the dark. Electricity must now be saved for emergencies. Saturday the 18th I spent in total darkness, tormented by thoughts and memories that threatened to overcome my German will. Klenze had gone mad and perished before reaching this sinister remnant of a past unwholesomely remote, and had advised me to go with him. Was, indeed, Fate preserving my reason only to draw me irresistibly to an end more horrible and unthinkable than any man has dreamed of? Clearly, my nerves were sorely taxed, and I must cast off these impressions of weaker men. I could not sleep Saturday night, and turned on the lights regardless of the future. It was annoying that the electricity should not last out the air and provisions. I revived my thoughts of euthanasia, and examined my automatic pistol. Toward morning I must have dropped asleep with the lights on, for I awoke in darkness yesterday afternoon to find the batteries dead. I struck several matches in succession, and desperately regretted the improvidence which had caused us long ago to use up the few candles we carried."}

I had often suspected that some cause of rot must be under certain signs of the dampness troubling my washing area. Sitll, I was not ready for anything like a real falling apart from a forgotten repair job. This repair was far away beyond all calculation. Most terrible of all were the discoveires. Hree, in plain, undeniable clearness, certain things stood out against the grout background. These were hair-thin cracked, moisture-puffed, age-weakened ceramic tiles. Their slightly curved-out surfaces and slightly curved-in dips told their own evil story. When I looked at them with a fearful close look, I could see all too clearly. Among the color changes and small holes were signs of those unusual branch-like patterns. There were also occasional hidden cracks. The meaning of these had become so disgusting to me.

They flopped, hopped, croaked, and bleated. They moved inhumanly through the ghostly moonlight. They moved in a twisted, evil dance of a bad dream. Some of them wore tall crowns made of a pale gold metal with no name. Some wore strange robes. One who led them wore a black coat with a hump and striped pants. A man's felt hat sat on the shapeless thing that was its head. I think their main color was a grayish green, but they had white stomachs. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges on their bcaks had scales. Their shapes were vaguely like apes. Their heads were fish heads with huge bulging eyes that neevr closed. On the sides of their necks were moving gills. Their long paws had webbing. They hopped in an irregular way, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was somehow glad they had olny four limbs. Their croaikng, howling voices were clearly used for speech. Their voices held all the dark shades of feeling that their staring faces lacked. But for all their monstrous look, they were not new to me. I knew too well what thye must be. Was not the memory of that evil crown at Newburyport still frseh? Tehy were the unholy fish-frogs of the nameless design. They were living and horrible. As I saw them, I also knew what thta humped, crowned priest in the black church basement had reminded me of. Their number was beyond guessing. It seemed to me there were endless crowds of them. Certainly my quick look could have shown only a small part. In aonther moment everything was gone because I fainted mercifully. It was my first fainting spell. A gentle daylight rain woke me from my daze in the brush-filled railway cut. When I stumbled out to the road ahead, I saw no marks in the fresh mdu. The fishy smell was also gone. Innsmouth's ruined roofs and lenaing steeples rose grayly to the southeast. I saw no living thing in all the empty salt marshes around. My watch was still working and told me it was past noon. The reality of what I had experienced was very unclear in my mind. But I felt that something horrible was in the background.\n###\nAnd yet I saw them in a limitless stream\u2014flopping, hopping, croaking, bleating\u2014surging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque, malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare. And some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless whitish-gold metal . . . and some were strangely robed . . . and one, who led the way, was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers, and had a man\u2019s felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head. . . . I think their predominant colour was a greyish-green, though they had white bellies. They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs were scaly. Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed. At the sides of their necks were palpitating gills, and their long paws were webbed. They hopped irregularly, sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four. I was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs. Their croaking, baying voices, clearly used for articulate speech, held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked. But for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me. I knew too well what they must be\u2014for was not the memory of that evil tiara at Newburyport still fresh? They were the blasphemous fish-frogs of the nameless design\u2014living and horrible\u2014and as I saw them I knew also of what that humped, tiaraed priest in the black church basement had so fearsomely reminded me. Their number was past guessing. It seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of them\u2014and certainly my momentary glimpse could have shewn only the least fraction. In another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting; the first I had ever had. It was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me from my stupor in the brush-grown railway cut, and when I staggered out to the roadway ahead I saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud. The fishy odour, too, was gone. Innsmouth\u2019s ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up greyly toward the southeast, but not a living creature did I spy in all the desolate salt marshes around. My watch was still going, and told me that the hour was past noon. The reality of what I had been through was highly uncertain in my mind, but I felt that something hideous lay in the background."}

Less is known about Of Gerrit Martense's descendants than abotu ourselves. We were all raised to hate the English civilisation. To avoid colonists who accepted it. Our life was very isolated. People said our isolation made us slwo in speech and understanding. In appearance, all had special inherited difference in eyes. One eye usually blue and the other brown. Our social contacts became fewer and fewer. At last, we began to marry within the many servant class around the estate. Many of our large family declined, moved across valley. Mixed with the mixed population. This population later produced the pitiful squattesr. The rest of us stayed stubbornly in our family mansion.

In finer buildings, too, the fluorescent hall was by no means unnoticed. For as the man-made light had slowly claimed its rule over the more old. Shadowed halls, it had naturally drawn the attention of the cleaning group, whose upkeep. Watch it was well suited by its very nature to need. Its start was known to be ne,w since the glowing tubes of company labs needed no introduction in this time. It turned out that the endless glare had spread far in recetn tens of years, ruling for a time in hospitals. Making at least a ghostly win of the underground areas of parking buildings. Its loko, when one dared to look at it straight, was that of a merciless. But for some reason or other the light did not like warmth. Whilst never actually turning itself off, it always kept such an air of clean distance that few could think of any comfort to get from it which would not sound very empty.\n###\nIn choicer edifices, too, the fluorescent corridor was by no means unremarked; for as the artificial luminance had gradually asserted its dominion over the more venerable and shadowed halls, it had naturally attracted the notice of the custodial order, whose maintenance and scrutiny it was well fitted by its very nature to demand. Its origin was known to be modern, since the phosphorescent tubes of corporate laboratories needed no introduction in this age. It developed that the ceaseless glare had propagated far in recent decades, reigning for a time in hospitals and making at least a spectral conquest of the subterranean realms of parking garages; and its aspect, when one dared to regard it directly, was that of a pitiless and clinical overseer. But for some reason or other the illumination did not care for warmth. Whilst never actually extinguishing itself, it always maintained such an aura of sterile detachment that few could think of any comfort to glean from it which would not sound profoundly hollow."}

It had high ceilings where the eye could only see cobwebs and shadows. The stones in the falling apart halls always seemed very wet. There was a cursed smell everyhwere. It smelled like piles of dead bodies from past generations. It was never bright. So he sometimes lit candles and stared at them for comfort. There was no sun outside either.

It was very obviously a dialogue, or an imitation of a dialogue. The regular change in tone suggested question and answer, statement and response. One voice was clearly that of Charles. But the other voice had a depth and hollowness. The young man's best attempts at ceremonial mimicry had hardly reached this level before. There was something horrible, disrespectful, and abnormal about it. If not for a cry from our recovering wife, which cleared our mind by waking our protective feelings, we likely could not have kept our old claim of never fainting for nearly another year. As it happened, we took our wife in our arms and carried her quickly downstairs. We did this before she could notice the voices that had so badyl disturbed us.

He watched the metal faces with their unchanging numbers where coins had gone. He forwned deeply at the printed rule on the rusty panel. For many years, the mysterious laws of the city council had spread their harmful effect from there. After a while, the evening started to come. The daytime noise was replaced by a vague, growing fear. This fear crept forward like a parking meter before the final time expired. The parking officer came at last. He showed much lack of care and mockery at the man's complaint. This was despite all the watchfulness taken to follow the rulse. He did not know about Henderson's special complaint. He promised to tell the office when the formal appeal could be made. Saying a short goodbye, he expressed his total powerlessness against the city's orders. He urged the man to accept the unavoidable money demands. Henderson was happy to get away from that curb. Something heavy and one-eyed seemed to hang over it. It was as if the eaten coins had left behind an echo of hopelessness. He had never trusted those devices. Even now, though he was calm, a qualtiy hid in their empty, shiny eyes. It made him feel a strong need to go back into the ungoverned alleys quickly.\n###\nFor almost two hours Mr. Henderson waited vainly by the municipal parking kiosk, watching the metallic faces with their implacable digits where coins had been inserted, and scowling darkly at the printed ordinance upon the rusted panel, whence for decades the arcane statutes of the city council had exerted their baleful influence. After a time the twilight began to gather, and the diurnal bustle gave place to a vague growing dread which crept meter-like before the final expiration. The enforcement officer finally arrived, and shewed much indifference and scorn at the petitioner\u2019s protest after all the vigilance which had been taken to observe the regulations. He had not known of Henderson\u2019s peculiar grievance, and promised to notify the bureau when the appeal might be formally lodged. In bidding the man a curt farewell he expressed his utter futility before the municipality\u2019s decrees, and urged the complainant to resign himself to the inexorable fiscal demands. Henderson was glad to escape from that curbside, for something oppressive and cyclopean seemed to brood over it; as if the devoured coins had left behind a resonance of despair. He had never trusted those mechanisms; and even now, stoic though he was, there lurked a character in their blank, glazed eyes which made him feel an urgent need to retreat into the unregulated alleys as soon as possible."}

A young person thought about these things. Then they learned about a case. This case has stayed with them. The records name the man as Joe Slater, or Slaader. He looked like a typical person from the Catskill Mountain area. These people come from early colonial farmers. They lived in remote hills for almost three hundred years. They did not travel much. This isolation made them become barbaric and degenerate. They did not progress like their relatives in more populated areas. These odd people are like the \"whiet trash\" in the Sout.h They have no law or morals. Their general mental state is likely lower than any other group of native American pepole.\n###\nIt was from a youthful reverie filled with speculations of this sort that I arose one afternoon in the winter of 1900\u20131901, when to the state psychopathic institution in which I served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly. His name, as given on the records, was Joe Slater, or Slaader, and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the Catskill Mountain region; one of those strange, repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of a little-travelled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy, rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts. Among these odd folk, who correspond exactly to the decadent element of \u201cwhite trash\u201d in the South, law and morals are non-existent; and their general mental status is probably below that of any other section of the native American people."}

It was group in one place I had seen. It impressed me that the visions of ages faded. there were the desert. The moon. The pieces of a past no one coudl guess. I moved and stopped. I shone the added light of my torch over the fallen pile. A hill had blown. It left a, mass of stones and pieces. It was forty feet and from two to eight feet. From the start I realized these stones had some quality. Not was the number of them without. Something in the sand - worn traces of design stopped me as I looked at them under the light of the moon. It was not that any one block was from the ones we found. It was something. The feeling did not come when I looked at one block. It came when I looked over at the time., at, I understood the truth. The patterns on of these blocks weer connected. They were parts of one idea. For the time in this age - shaken waste, I had found a mass of masonry in its position. It was fallen and broken,. But it existed in a way. Mounting at a place, I climbed with effort over the heap. and I cleared away sand with my fingers. I kept trying to understand the sizes, shapes, and styles. I tried to understand the relationships of the designs. After a while I could guess the nature of the structure. I could guess at the designs that covered the surfaces of the masonry. The match of the whole with some glimpses from my dreams frightened. This was a hall thirty feet. It was paved with eight - sided blcoks and had a roof. There would have been rooms opening off on the right. At the end, one of those slopde paths would have wound down to depths. I jumped as these ideas came to me. There was in them than the blocks themselves had given. How did I know this level should have been?\n###\nIt was the largest group in one place that I had so far seen, and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away. Again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an unguessed past. I drew close and paused, and cast the added light of my electric torch over the tumbled pile. A hillock had blown away, leaving a low, irregularly round mass of megaliths and smaller fragments some forty feet across and from two to eight feet high. From the very outset I realised that there was some utterly unprecedented quality about these stones. Not only was the mere number of them quite without parallel, but something in the sand-worn traces of design arrested me as I scanned them under the mingled beams of the moon and my torch. Not that any one differed essentially from the earlier specimens we had found. It was something subtler than that. The impression did not come when I looked at one block alone, but only when I ran my eye over several almost simultaneously. Then, at last, the truth dawned upon me. The curvilinear patterns on many of these blocks were closely related\u2014parts of one vast decorative conception. For the first time in this aeon-shaken waste I had come upon a mass of masonry in its old position\u2014tumbled and fragmentary, it is true, but none the less existing in a very definite sense. Mounting at a low place, I clambered laboriously over the heap; here and there clearing away the sand with my fingers, and constantly striving to interpret varieties of size, shape, and style, and relationships of design. After a while I could vaguely guess at the nature of the bygone structure, and at the designs which had once stretched over the vast surfaces of the primal masonry. The perfect identity of the whole with some of my dream-glimpses appalled and unnerved me. This was once a Cyclopean corridor thirty feet tall, paved with octagonal blocks and solidly vaulted overhead. There would have been rooms opening off on the right, and at the farther end one of those strange inclined planes would have wound down to still lower depths. I started violently as these conceptions occurred to me, for there was more in them than the blocks themselves had supplied. How did I know that this level should have been far underground?"}

The cluttered floor stopped a running start, but madness pushed us on. We picked a place near the left-hand wall. There, the gap was least wide. The ladning spot was fairly clear of dangerous wrekcage. After one wild moment, we reached the other side safely. Finally reaching the lower level, we stumbled past the arch of the machine room.

Hidden degrees, there seemed to develop a curious follow-up to one of his family history successes from the year before. He had discovered among his mother's ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen. This man had come from Salem in March of 1692. A whispered series of highly unusual and disturbing stories gathered about him. Ward's great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in.\n###\nThen, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered. Ward\u2019s great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain \u201cAnn Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast\u201d, of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground \u2018that her Husband\u2019s name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho\u2019 not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting\u2019. This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers. It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid. Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \u201chushed-up\u201d character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy."}

But the northbound connecting express train had waited. Transferring in a hurry, I felt a strange tightness in my chest. Thee train cars moved on through the early afternoon sun into lands I had only read about. I had never been there before. I knew I was entering a much older and more basic New England. It was different from the mechanical, city-like coastal. Southern places where I had always lived. This was a pure, old New England without foreigners and factory smoke. It had no billboards and concrete roads like the parts changed by modern times. There would be odd pieces left of that ongoing local life. Its deep roots make it the only true product of the land.

I would not let myself think about what endless caves of forever night mihgt wait below. Later, I crawled along a poorly built part of the hallway. I reached a spot where the roof had completely fallen in. The wreckage was piled like a [THING]. I climbed over it. I passed through a huge empty area. My torchlight could not show any walls or arched [THING] there. I thought this must be the basement of the [THING] sellers ' [THING]. It faced the third square not far from the record halls. I could not guess what had happened to it. I found the hallway again on the other side of the [THING] of trash. But after a short distance, I met a completely blocked place. The fallen arcehd [THING] almost touched the dangerously drooping roof above. I do not know how I forced. Pulled aside enough [THING] blcoks to make a path. I do not know how I dared to move the tightly packed pieces. The smallest change in balance could have made all the tons of [THING] above fall. Crush me to nothing. It was pure madness that pushed and led me. That is, if my whole trip underground was not just a hellish false vision. dream, which I hope it was. But I did make, or dream I made, a passage I could squeeze through. As I wriggled over the pile of wreckage, I held my torch in my mouth. It was switched on the whole time. I felt myself cut by the sharp, hanging points of the rough [THING] above me. I was now near the great underground record [THING]. It seemed to be my goal. Sliding and I climbed down the far side of the barrier. I moved carefully along the last part of the hallway. I held my torch, which flashed on and off. I finally reached a low, round [THING] with arches. The arches opened on all sides. They were still in amazingly good shap.e The walls, or the parts my torchlight could reach, were covered with carved picture writing. They had the usual curved symbols. Some symbols had been added since the time of my dreams. I knew this was my planned stopping place. I turned at once through a knwon archway on my left. Strangely, I had almost no doubt I could find a clear path up. Down the slope to all the levels still there. This huge, [THING] - protected [THING] held the records of the whole solar system. It was built with amazing skill. Strength to last as long as the system itself.\n###\nNow it lay open\u2014black and yawning, and giving forth a current of cool, damp air. Of what limitless caverns of eternal night might brood below, I would not permit myself to think. Later, clawing my way along a badly heaped section of the corridor, I reached a place where the roof had wholly caved in. The debris rose like a mountain, and I climbed up over it, passing through a vast empty space where my torchlight could reveal neither walls nor vaulting. This, I reflected, must be the cellar of the house of the metal-purveyors, fronting on the third square not far from the archives. What had happened to it I could not conjecture. I found the corridor again beyond the mountain of detritus and stones, but after a short distance encountered a wholly choked place where the fallen vaulting almost touched the perilously sagging ceiling. How I managed to wrench and tear aside enough blocks to afford a passage, and how I dared disturb the tightly packed fragments when the least shift of equilibrium might have brought down all the tons of superincumbent masonry to crush me to nothingness, I do not know. It was sheer madness that impelled and guided me\u2014if, indeed, my whole underground adventure was not\u2014as I hope\u2014a hellish delusion or phase of dreaming. But I did make\u2014or dream that I made\u2014a passage that I could squirm through. As I wriggled over the mound of debris\u2014my torch, switched continuously on, thrust deeply within my mouth\u2014I felt myself torn by the fantastic stalactites of the jagged floor above me. I was now close to the great underground archival structure which seemed to form my goal. Sliding and clambering down the farther side of the barrier, and picking my way along the remaining stretch of corridor with hand-held, intermittently flashing torch, I came at last to a low, circular crypt with arches\u2014still in a marvellous state of preservation\u2014opening off on every side. The walls, or such parts of them as lay within reach of my torchlight, were densely hieroglyphed and chiselled with typical curvilinear symbols\u2014some added since the period of my dreams.

Out of the South it would move very smoothly and quietly over the [THING]. Whether the [THING] was stormy. Whether the [THING] was good. Bad, it would always move smoothly. Its sails were far away. Its long, strange rows of oars moved in a steady rhythm. One night I saw a [THING] on the deck. He had a beard and wore a robe. He seemed to wave me to come aboard for beautiful, unknown shores. I saw him many times after that under the full [THING]. He always wvaed me to come. The [THING] shone Very brightly on the night I answered. I walked over the [THING] to the White Ship on a path made of moonlight. The [THING] who had waved now spkoe a welcome. He used a soft language I seemed to know well. The hours were filled with the soft songs of the rowers. We moved away into a mysterious South. It was golden with the light of that full, soft [THING]. When day came, it was pink and bright. I saw the green shore of faraway lands. It was bright and beautiful and unknown to me. Grand green terraces rose from the [THING]. They had many trees. Here and there I saw the shining white roofs and columns of strange temples. As we got closer to the green shore, the bearded [THING] told me about that land. It was the Land of Zar. All the dreams. Thoughts of beauty that come to men once. Are forgotten live there. When I looked at the terraces again, I saw he spoke the truth. Among the sights before me were many things I had once seen. I had seen them through the mists beyond the horizo.n In the glowing deep parts of the [THING]. There were also shapes and fantasies more wonderful than any I had ever known. They were the visions of young poets. These poets died poor before the world could learn what they had seen and dreamed. But we did not step onto the sloping meadows of Zar. It is said that he who walks on them can never return to his home shore. As the White Ship sailed quietly away from the terraces with temples of Zar, we saw the tall towers of a great [THING] on the far horizon ahead. The bearded [THING] said to me: \" This is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders. All those mysteries that [THING] has tried but failed to understand live there. \".\n###\nOut of the South it would glide very smoothly and silently over the sea. And whether the sea was rough or calm, and whether the wind was friendly or adverse, it would always glide smoothly and silently, its sails distant and its long strange tiers of oars moving rhythmically. One night I espied upon the deck a man, bearded and robed, and he seemed to beckon me to embark for fair unknown shores. Many times afterward I saw him under the full moon, and ever did he beckon me. Very brightly did the moon shine on the night I answered the call, and I walked out over the waters to the White Ship on a bridge of moonbeams. The man who had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft language I seemed to know well, and the hours were filled with soft songs of the oarsmen as we glided away into a mysterious South, golden with the glow of that full, mellow moon. And when the day dawned, rosy and effulgent, I beheld the green shore of far lands, bright and beautiful, and to me unknown. Up from the sea rose lordly terraces of verdure, tree-studded, and shewing here and there the gleaming white roofs and colonnades of strange temples. As we drew nearer the green shore the bearded man told me of that land, the Land of Zar, where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that come to men once and then are forgotten. And when I looked upon the terraces again I saw that what he said was true, for among the sights before me were many things I had once seen through the mists beyond the horizon and in the phosphorescent depths of ocean. There too were forms and fantasies more splendid than any I had ever known; the visions of young poets who died in want before the world could learn of what they had seen and dreamed. But we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of Zar, for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore. As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar, we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and the bearded man said to me: \u201cThis is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom.\u201d"}

In the fall of that year, Wilbur started to organize the collected mail in the study. He began sorting its many envelopes and flyers. Soon later, the mail carrier mentioned to the customers at the general store that more organizing was happening at the Whateley home. Wilbur was separating all the letters and ads on the oak desk. He seemed to be throwing away junk mail. He and his grandfather had done this with magazines a few seasons earlier. He was working in that messy room. The mail carrier noticed he seemed unusually rushed and upset. Neighbors generally believed he knew something about his uncle's ignored mail. Very few peolpe ever asked about his progress now. His collection had grown to more than seven boxes.

Wilbur was segregating all the letters and advertisements upon the oaken desk, and appeared to be discarding solicitations as he and his grandfather had done with the periodicals some seasons before. He was laboring in that cluttered chamber, and the postman perceived he seemed peculiarly harried and agitated.

This feeling destroyed our last bit of self-control. It made us run wildly south. We ran past the wide black doorways. The fish-like staring windows of that empty nightmare street. Looking closer, we saw the moonlit water between the reef. The shore was not empty. It was full of many shapes swimming toward the town. Even from far away. In a quick look, we could tell the moving heads. Waving arms were strange. They were strange in a way that is hard to describe or fully undrestand.\n###\nIt was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon me\u2014the impression which destroyed my last vestige of self-control and set me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street.

He did not see that humor is also meaningless in a universe without thought, a universe that lacks any real standard for what makes sense. Does not make sense. In the early days of his feeling trapped, he turned to the gentle faith of the church. This faith was dear to him becuase of the simple trust of his ancestors. From it, he saw mysterious paths that seemed to offer an escape from life. Only when he looked closer did he notice the lack of imagination and beauty. He saw the dull, ordinary, and boring nature of it. He saw the overly serious. Strange claims of absolute truth that ruled in a boring. Overpowering way among most of its followers. He fully felt the clumsiness with which it tried to keep aliv,e as literal fact, the outdated fears. Guesses of ancient [THING] facing the unknown. It tired Carter to see how seriously [THING] tried to make real - world truth from old myths. Every step of their proud science disproved these myths. This wrong kind of seriousness destroyed the connection he might have kept for the old beliefs. He might have kept it if they had been happy to offer the grand ceremonies. Emotional releases in their true form of light, airy fantasy. When he came to study those who had rejected the old myths, he found them even more unpleasant than those who had not. They did not know that beauty exists in harmony. They did not know that the loveliness of life has no standard in a pointless universe. Its only standard is its harmony with the dreams. Feelings that came before. Blindly shaped our small worlds from the remaining chaos. They did not see that good. Ugliness are only decorative results of point of view. Their only value lies in their connection to what chance made our ancestors think. Their finer details are different for every race and every culture. Instead, they either denied these things completely. Moved them to the rough, unclear instincts they shared with animals. Because of this, their lives were dragged out in a bad - smellnig way through pain, ugliness. Lack of balance. Their lives were filled with a ridiculous pride at having escaped from something no less faulty than what still controlled them. They had exchanged the false gods of fear. Unthinking respect for the false gods of excessive freedom. Carter did not experience much of these modern freedoms. Their low quality and dirtiness sickened a spirit that loved only beauty. At the same time, his reason fought against the weak logic their supporters used. They tried to cover raw impulse with a sacredness taken from the idols they had thrown away.\n###\nIn this way he became a kind of humorist, for he did not see that even humour is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true standard of consistency or inconsistency. In the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly faith endeared to him by the naive trust of his fathers, for thence stretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from life. Only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and prosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy. But when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths, he found them even more ugly than those who had not. They did not know that beauty lies in harmony, and that loveliness of life has no standard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the dreams and the feelings which have gone before and blindly moulded our little spheres out of the rest of chaos. They did not see that good and evil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective, whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers think and feel, and whose finer details are different for every race and culture. Instead, they either denied these things altogether or transferred them to the crude, vague instincts which they shared with the beasts and peasants; so that their lives were dragged malodorously out in pain, ugliness, and disproportion, yet filled with a ludicrous pride at having escaped from something no more unsound than that which still held them. They had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety for those of licence and anarchy. Carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their cheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone, while his reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions tried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had discarded."}

Where the source of the water damage seemed to be fcoused, the repairs had not gone as well. They were slowly losing to the spread of the mold underneath. The owner had quickly called for more grout for this area from the supplies in cabinet. This had hardened very well in the earlier steps of the repair. Then, when the western effort was finished, the successful leftover workers hurried across to help their struggling coworkers. They reversed the decay. Pushed the cracks back again along the grout line of the shower. The surface marks were by this time all hidden. But the last of the web-like problems held on stubbornly. Their sharp branches were stuck in the porous and base material. The time for surface treatments was now almost over.

On the eastern expanse, however, where the progenitor of the moisture-damage appeared to be concentrated, the repairs had not fared so well; and were slowly yielding to the encroachment of the underlying mold. The proprietor had quickly summoned additional grout for this front from the reserves in the cabinet, and this had solidified admirably in the earlier stages of the restoration. Then, when the western campaign was concluded, the triumphant remainder hastened across to the aid of their beleaguered counterparts; reversing the decay and forcing the fractures back again along the narrow grout-line of the shower. The superficial blemishes were by this time all concealed, but the last of the deep, web-like horrors persisted tenaciously with their jagged tendrils embedded in the porous and abominable substrate. The time for surface treatments was now nearly past, and the endeavor became a meticulous confrontation of what few sealing agents could adhere upon that compromised plane."}

The government was clearly complex and likely socialist. But the sculptures we saw did not give definite proof. There was much trade, both local and between cities. Some smlal, flat, five-pointed counters with writing served as money. Probably the smaller greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of this money. The culture was mostly city-based.

The professors told Ammi all of this while they stood at his door. He went with them again to see the stone messenger frmo the stars. His wife did not go this time. The object had clearly gotten smaller. Even the serious professors could not deny what they saw. The shrinking brown lump near the well had empty space around it, except where the ground had fallen in. The day before it was about seven feet across. Now it was barely five feet. It was still warm.

All around the dwindling brown lump near the well was a vacant space, except where the earth had caved in; and whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before, it was now scarcely five. It was still hot, and the sages studied its surface curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and chisel.

They went through rooms and halls in various states of ruin or condition. They climbed up slopes, crossed upper floors and bridges, and climbed down. They found blocked doors and piles of rubble. Sometimes they hurried along very well-kept and strangely clean sections. They took wrogn turns and went back, removing the paper trail they left. Sometimes they reached the bottom of an open shaft where daylight came down. The carved walls along the way often tempted them. Many carvings likely told very important historical stories.

His dreams wree fading under the mockery of the tmies. He could not believe in anything. His love of harmony kept him near the customs of his people. He walked without feeling through human cities. He sighed because no view seemed completely real. Every flash of yellow sun on tall roofs. Every sight of plazas with railings in the first evening lamps only reminded him of dreams he once knew. It made him miss airy lands he no longer knew how to find. Travel was only a fake copy. Even the Great War moved him very little, though he served from the satrt in the Foreign Legion of France. For a time he looked for friends. He soon grew tired of the roughness of their feelings. Plainness of their viesw. The observer felt slightly happy that all his relatives were far away. Out of contact. They could not have understood his inner life. That is, only his grandfather. Great-uncle Christopher could have. Tehy had been dead a long time.\n###\nAmidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live as befitted a man of keen thought and good heritage. With his dreams fading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything, but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and station. He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed because no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known, and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find. Travel was only a mockery; and even the Great War stirred him but little, though he served from the first in the Foreign Legion of France. For a while he sought friends, but soon grew weary of the crudeness of their emotions, and the sameness and earthiness of their visions. He felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and out of touch with him, for they could not have understood his mental life. That is, none but his grandfather and great-uncle Christopher could, and they were long dead."}

Before checking the archways for stairs going, the doctor moved his light over the stone floor. The floor was paved. At spots, there was a stone slab with holes drilled in it in no pattern. In one place, a ladder lay on the ground., a amount of the smell seemed to cling to this ladder. As he walked, it struck Willett that the noise. Smell were above the pierced slabs. It was as if they were trapdoors leading to a place of horror. Kneeling by one, he tried to move a slab with his hands. He found he could shift it with effort. At his touch, the moaning from grew. He lifted the stone with fear. An stench rose from. The doctor felt as he moved the slab. Pointed his light into the exposed hole. If he had expected stairs leading to a pit of horror, Willett was disappointed. In that smell. Broken whining, he saw the brick top of a round. It was about a yard. A half. Had no ladder. Way to climb down. As the light shone down, the wailing became a series of yelps. Along with this came the sound of, scrambling and thumping. The explorer shook, not wanting to imagine what thing might hide in that hole. But after a moment, he found the courage to look over the edge. He lay. Held the torch down at arm 's length to see what was.\n###\nFrom that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willett\u2019s attention could no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and the doctor\u2019s head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness. If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arm\u2019s length to see what might lie below."}

I have not failed in my duties to do so. The squire who inherited it in 1768 studied certain arts. He made certain discoveries. These were all linked to forces in this specific piece of land. They deserved the strongest protection. I now intend to show you some strange results of these arts and discoveries. I will do this in the strictest secrecy. I trust my judgment of people. I have no doubt about your interest or your loyalty.\" He stopped. I could only nod. I said I was alarmed. Yet to my soul, the ordinary daylight wrold of New York felt more deadly. Whether this man was a harmless odd person. A user of dangerous arts, I had no choice. I had to follow him. I had to satisfy my curiosity with whatever he might show. So I listened. \"To my ancestor,\" he continued softly, \"the human will seemed to have very remarkable qualities. These qaulities had an unsuspected power. This power was not only over one's own actions and the actions of others. It was also over every kind of force and subsatnce in Nature. It was over many elements and dimensions considered more universal than Nature itself. Should I say he mocked the sacredness of things as great as space and time? Should I say he used the rituals of certain mixed-blood red Indians in strange ways? Those people once camped on this hill. These Indians showed anger when the place was built. They were annoyingly persistent in asking to visit the grounds at the full moon. For years, they stole over the wall each month when they could. They secretly performed certain acts. Then, in 1768, the new squire caught them in the act. He stood still at what he saw. After that, he made a deal with them. He gave them free access to his grounds. In exchange, he learned the full details of what they did. He learned that their grandfathers got part of their practice from red ancestors. They got another part from an old Dutchman from the time of the States-General. And curse him, I fear the squire must have given them terribly bad rum. It might have been on purpose or not. A week after he learned the secret, he was the only living man who knew it.\n###\nThere were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family, and I have not been remiss in discharging such obligations. The squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding. Some curious effects of these arts and discoveries I now purpose to shew you, under the strictest secrecy; and I believe I may rely on my judgment of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelity.\u201d He paused, but I could only nod my head. I have said that I was alarmed, yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of New York, and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts I had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to offer. So I listened. \u201cTo\u2014my ancestor\u2014\u201d he softly continued, \u201cthere appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a little-suspected dominance not only over the acts of one\u2019s self and of others, but over every variety of force and substance in Nature, and over many elements and dimensions deemed more univarsal than Nature herself. May I say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time, and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half-breed red Indians once encamped upon this hill? These Indians shewed choler when the place was built, and were plaguy pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon. For years they stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth performed sartain acts. Then, in \u201968, the new squire catched them at their doings, and stood still at what he saw. Thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did; larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old Dutchman in the time of the States-General. And pox on him, I\u2019m afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum\u2014whether or not by intent\u2014for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it."}

When the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes, and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky. The sides of the rock were very steep; but on ledges here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings, and the low railings guarding travelled high roads. No ship of men had ever come so near the place, or at least, had never come so near and departed again; but Carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on, rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlands. The headlands were prolongations of the island proper, and came so closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them. There seemed to be no watchers on the outside, so the galley was steered boldly through the flume-like strait and into the stagnant foetid harbour beyond. Here, however, all was bustle and activity; with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay, and scores of almost-human slaves and moon-beasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries. There was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves, with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock. Of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite none might say, but the things one saw on the outside were far from encouraging. At sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness; those with eyes staring intently, and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly. They did not, of course, realise that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved almost-humans, and the night-gaunts were all out of sight below. By this time the leaders had fully formed a plan; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon as the wharf was touched, and then to sail directly away, leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those almost mindless creatures."}

Charles Ward found a collection of letters between Durfee and Arnold. He found them in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq. Of George St. The letters cover this time and slightly earlier period. They clearly show how much the public disliked this unsuitable marriage. However, the social power of the Tillinghasts family was strong. So, Joseph Curwen again saw his hosue visited by people he could not normally invite. His acceptance was not total. His bride suffered socially because of this forced marriage. But at least the complete social rejection was lessened. The strange groom treated his wief with great kindness and care. This surprised her and the community. The new house in Olney Court was now free from any troubling events. Curwen was often away at the Pawtuxet farm. His wife never went there. But he seemed more like a normal citizen than ever before. Only one person remained openly hostile to him. This was the young ship officer. His engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been suddenly ended. Ezra Weeden openly promised revenge. He was usually quiet and mild. But now he developed a stubborn, hateful determination. This did not look good for the husband who took his place.\n###\nThe collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful ship\u2019s officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband."}

He wanted help figuring out the late fees for the overdue books. He spoke in a tired, broken way that seemed distracted and tested patience. The clerk answered sharply. The obvious lateness of the books suggested a person who was not responsible. The borrower's reply made enough impression on the clerk that he wrtoe it down word for word. It had a strangely thoughtful tone that likely matched his whole story. I have since found this very typical of him. He said, \"They are late, it's true.

The borrower\u2019s rejoinder, which impressed the clerk enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a curiously speculative cast which must have typified his whole explanation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him.

We do not believe anyone since Goya could put. Much pure horror into a face. Before Goya, you must look back to the medieval artists who made the gargoyles. Chimeras on Notre Dame. They believed many things. Maybe they also saw many things, because the Middle Ages had some strange periods. We remember you asking Pickman yourself once, the year before you left, where he got such ideas. Was that not an unpleasant laugh he gave you? That laugh was partly why Reid ended the friendship. Reid, you know, had just started studying comparative pathology. He was full of proud \"inside information\" about the biological. Evolutionary meaning of this. He said Pickman repelled him more each day. It almost frightened him near the end. He remarked the man's face. Expression were slowly changing in a way he did not like. It was a way that was not human. He talked a lot about diet. He said Pickman must be very abnormal and eccentric. We think you told Reid, if you.

The wind above screamed uselessly and wildly through the high peaks behind us. Every small detail of this walk will stay in our minds forever. Only Danforth and us could imagine such sights, and only in strange nightmares. The moving clouds in the west was a huge mess of dark stone towers. Their strange and unbelievable shapes looked new from every angle. It was like a solid stone mirage. Without the phoots, we would still doubt such a thing could exist.

That such underground areas truly existed seemed very clear to the observer from many signs. Groans clearly came up now. Then from what seemed like solid ground, far from any building. Meanwhile, hidden in bushes along the riverbank at the back, where high land sloped steeply down to Pawtuxet valley, the writer found an arched oak door in heavy stonework. This was clearly an entrance to caves inside the hill. Weeden could not say when or how these underground rooms were built. He often pointed out how easily unseen work crews from the river could have reached the place. Joseph Curwen certainly used his mixed sailors for many purposes! During heavy spring rains in 1769, the two watchers watched the steep riverbank closely. They wanted to see if any underground secrets might be washed out. They were rewarded by seeing many human. Animal bones where deep glulies had formed in the banks. Naturally there could be many explanations for such things behind a livestock farm. It was also an area where old Indian burial grounds were common. But Weeden and Smith drew their own conclusions.\n###\nThat such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill. When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was unable to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light, and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm, and in a locality where old Indian burying-grounds were common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences."}

They seemed like madness. At times, he believed he was truly going insane. Was there a special type of false belief that affects people who have lost their memory?

Conceivably, the efforts of the subconscious mind to fill up a perplexing blank with pseudo-memories might give rise to strange imaginative vagaries. This, indeed (though an alternative folklore theory finally seemed to me more plausible), was the belief of many of the alienists who helped me in my search for parallel cases, and who shared my puzzlement at the exact resemblances sometimes discovered. They did not call the condition true insanity, but classed it rather among neurotic disorders. My course in trying to track it down and analyse it, instead of vainly seeking to dismiss or forget it, they heartily endorsed as correct according to the best psychological principles.

Early in the drilling, the sandstone changed to a layer of Comanchian limestone. The limestone had many small fossil cephalopods, corals, echini, and spirifera. It also had some signs of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones. The bones were probably from teliosts, sharks, and ganoids. This was very important. It gave the expedition its first vertebrate fsosils. But soon after, the drill head went through the layer into empty space. This caused a new and much stronger wave of excitement among the excavators. A large blast opened the underground secret. Now, through a rough opening about five feet across. Three feet thick, the eager searchers saw a shallow limestone hollow. Water trickling through the ground woer this hollow more than fifty million years ago. This happened in a past tropical world.\n###\nThey had struck a cave.

Their height could not be than ten feet. the urge to look down at myself grew and. One night I could not fight it. At my look showed nothing. A moment I understood why. My head was at the end of a neck. Retracting this neck and looking, I saw a scaly, wrinkled, mass. It was a cone ten feet and ten feet at the bottom. That was when I woke up half of Arkham screaming as I jumped up from the pit of sleep. after weeks of repetition did I become used to these visions of myself in shape. In the dreams I moved among the beings. I read bokos from the shelves. I wrote for hours at the tables with a pen. The tentacles hangign from my head held the pen. Snatches of what I read and wrote stayed in my memory. There were records of worlds and universes. There were records of life stirring outside all universes. There were records of orders of beings that lived in the world in forgotten pasts. There were stories of intelligences wiht bodies. They would live in it millions of years after the human died. And I learned about chapters in history. No scholar today has guessed they exist. of these writings were in the language of the hieroglyphs. I studied it in a way with the help of droning machines. It was a glued - together speech. Its root systems were unlike any in languages. bokos were in tongues learned the way. A were in languages I knew. pictures helped me a lot. They were both put in the records and made collections. All the time I seemed to be writing a history of my age in English. On waking, I could remember, bits of the tongues. My dream - self had mastered them. But sentences of the history stayed with me.\n###\nI was mightily troubled by the fact that I always saw the great tables\u2014whose height could not be under ten feet\u2014from a level not below that of their surfaces. And then the morbid temptation to look down at myself became greater and greater, till one night I could not resist it. At first my downward glance revealed nothing whatever. A moment later I perceived that this was because my head lay at the end of a flexible neck of enormous length. Retracting this neck and gazing down very sharply, I saw the scaly, rugose, iridescent bulk of a vast cone ten feet tall and ten feet wide at the base. That was when I waked half of Arkham with my screaming as I plunged madly up from the abyss of sleep. Only after weeks of hideous repetition did I grow half-reconciled to these visions of myself in monstrous form. In the dreams I now moved bodily among the other unknown entities, reading terrible books from the endless shelves and writing for hours at the great tables with a stylus managed by the green tentacles that hung down from my head. Snatches of what I read and wrote would linger in my memory. There were horrible annals of other worlds and other universes, and of stirrings of formless life outside of all universes. There were records of strange orders of beings which had peopled the world in forgotten pasts, and frightful chronicles of grotesque-bodied intelligences which would people it millions of years after the death of the last human being. And I learned of chapters in human history whose existence no scholar of today has ever suspected. Most of these writings were in the language of the hieroglyphs; which I studied in a queer way with the aid of droning machines, and which was evidently an agglutinative speech with root systems utterly unlike any found in human languages. Other volumes were in other unknown tongues learned in the same queer way. A very few were in languages I knew. Extremely clever pictures, both inserted in the records and forming separate collections, aided me immensely. And all the time I seemed to be setting down a history of my own age in English. On waking, I could recall only minute and meaningless scraps of the unknown tongues which my dream-self had mastered, though whole phrases of the history stayed with me."}

He did not realize any change when he stopped moving as something grabbed him from.

He told of the need to gather a group to.\n###\nSo worn and narrow were the steps, and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth, that the climber never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate pits; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian night-gaunts would suddenly pounce upon him, if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage. All about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs, and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not made for mankind. In time he became very numb and somnolent, moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will; nor did he realise any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind. He was flying very rapidly through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery night-gaunts had performed their duty. Awaked to the fact that he was in the cold, damp clutch of the faceless flutterers, Carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight. Mindless though night-gaunts are said to be, the effect was instantaneous; for all tickling stopped at once, and the creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position. Thus encouraged, Carter ventured some explanations; telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by the moon-beasts, and of the need of assembling a party to rescue them. The night-gaunts, though inarticulate, seemed to understand what was said; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight. Suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth, and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw. Scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place; and as Carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons, a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery, dog-like tenants. The night-gaunts now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet, afterward withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer. Carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company, and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for the rescue. After a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared, and made significant signs to the night-gaunts, causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark."}

Lyman did not consider the strange letters of young Ward's friend very significant. They knew that similar eccentric people often group together. They believed Charles or Allen had just found a similar person living abroad. This person may have seen Orne's handwriting. Copied it to pretedn to be the dead person reborn. Allen himself might be a similar case. He may have convinced the young man to accept him as a rebirth of the long-dead Curwen. Such tihngs were known before. Using the same reasoning, the pratcical doctors dismissed Willett's growing worry about Charles Ward's current handwriting. He studied samples gotten by various tricks. Willett thought he finally recognized the oddly familiar style of the writing. It vaguely looked like the old handwriting of Joseph Curwen himself. The other doctors saw this as imitation, which is expected in this kind of madness. They refused to see it as important, good or bad. Recognising this plain attitude from his colleagues, Willett advised that Mr. Ward keep private a letter. The letter arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rauks, Transylvania. Its handwriting was. Extremely like the Hutchinson code that the father. Doctor stopped in awe before opening it. The letter said:.\n###\nDrs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young Ward\u2019s companion; for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart\u2014perhaps one who had seen Orne\u2019s handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone character\u2019s reincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead Curwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the hard-headed doctors disposed of Willett\u2019s growing disquiet about Charles Ward\u2019s present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus, Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal.

A, object crashed down in the yard udner the front. The tower was that the candles would not burn. As the object neared the ground, the people knew it was the smoke - blackened boarding of that tower 's east window., a stink poured out from the heights. It choked and sickened the shaking watchers. It knocked over those in the square. At the time, the air shook with a vibration like flapping wings. A east - blowing wind, than any blast, snatched off hats. It twisted the umbrellas of the crowd. Nothing could be seen in the candleless night. Some - looking people thought they saw a spreading blur of blackenss against the sky. It was something like a cloud of smoke. It shot with meteor - speed toawrd the east. That was all. The watchers were frozen with fright, awe, and discomfort. They knew what to do, or whether to do anything. Not knowing what had happened, they did not stop their watch. A moment, they sent up a prayer. A flash of lightning, followed by an earsplitting crash of sound, tore the sky. Half an hour, the rain stopped. In fifteen mniutes, the street - lights came on. They sent the, watchers to their homes with relief. The day 's papers gave these matters mention in connection with the storm reports. It seems the lightning flash.

A man in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a. mass of smoke in the air as the flash burst. But his sighting has not been confirmed.\n###\nThen at last there was a sound of splintering wood, and a large, heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly facade. The tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn, but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was the smoke-grimed louver-boarding of that tower\u2019s east window. Immediately afterward an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the unseen heights, choking and sickening the trembling watchers, and almost prostrating those in the square. At the same time the air trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings, and a sudden east-blowing wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas of the crowd. Nothing definite could be seen in the candleless night, though some upward-looking spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of denser blackness against the inky sky\u2014something like a formless cloud of smoke that shot with meteor-like speed toward the east. That was all. The watchers were half numbed with fright, awe, and discomfort, and scarcely knew what to do, or whether to do anything at all. Not knowing what had happened, they did not relax their vigil; and a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated lightning, followed by an earsplitting crash of sound, rent the flooded heavens. Half an hour later the rain stopped, and in fifteen minutes more the street-lights sprang on again, sending the weary, bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homes. The next day\u2019s papers gave these matters minor mention in connexion with the general storm reports. It seems that the great lightning flash and deafening explosion which followed the Federal Hill occurrence were even more tremendous farther east, where a burst of the singular foetor was likewise noticed. The phenomenon was most marked over College Hill, where the crash awaked all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of speculations. Of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill, or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens. It was agreed that the lone, sudden lightning-bolt must have struck somewhere in this neighbourhood, though no trace of its striking could afterward be found. A youth in the Tau Omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst, but his observation has not been verified."}

He said he decided to keep the camp where Moulton's plane had to land. Repairs had already started there. The ice sheet was very thin. Dark ground was visible in places. He would do some drilling and blasting right there before any sled trips or climbs. He spoke of the incredible greatness of the whole scene. He described his strange feelings being near huge silent peaks. They rose lkie a wall reaching the sky at the edge of the world. Atwood's measurements put the five tallest peaks between 30,000 and 34,000 feet high. The wind-swept land clearly worried Lake. It suggested there were sometimes very strong winds. These would be worse than any we had met so far. His camp was a little over five miles from where the higher foothills rose sharply. We could almost sense a hidden fera in his words. They came over 700 miles of empty ice. He urged that we all hurry with the matetr. He wanted the strange new area dealt with as soon as possible. He was about to rest now. He had worked a full day at great speed and effort, with many results.\n###\nLake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where Moulton\u2019s plane had been forced down, and where repairs had already progressed somewhat. The ice-sheet was very thin, with dark ground here and there visible, and he would sink some borings and blasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing expeditions. He spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene, and the queer state of his sensations at being in the lee of vast silent pinnacles whose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world\u2019s rim. Atwood\u2019s theodolite observations had placed the height of the five tallest peaks at from 30,000 to 34,000 feet. The windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed Lake, for it argued the occasional existence of prodigious gales violent beyond anything we had so far encountered. His camp lay a little more than five miles from where the higher foothills abruptly rose. I could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his words\u2014flashed across a glacial void of 700 miles\u2014as he urged that we all hasten with the matter and get the strange new region disposed of as soon as possible. He was about to rest now, after a continuous day\u2019s work of almost unparalleled speed, strenuousness, and results."}

Dogs barked wildly all night lon.g People who got up early on 10th noticed a strange smell in the air. Around seven o'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy from George Corey's place, located between Cold Srping Glen.

Outside in thhe yard, the equally scared cows were stomping and crying sadly. They had followed the boy back, sharing his fear. Between breaths, Luther tried to tell his story to Mrs. Corey.\n###\nIt was in the dark of September 9th that the horror broke loose. The hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all night. Early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven o\u2019clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey\u2019s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey."}

This was the backrgound of mixed legend and hallucination. Around 1920 we had our research in clear order. We felt a small decrease in the tension that earlier stages had raised. Despite ideas caused by strong feelings, were not most of our events easy to explain? Any chance could have turned our minds to dark studies during the memory loss. Then we read the forbidden legends and met members of old and disliked cults. That clearly gave material for the dreams and upset feelings after memory returned. About the side notes in dream symbols. Languages we did not know. Librarians said we wrote them. We might easily have learned a little of the languages during our secondary state. The symbols were likely made by our imagination from descriptions in old legends. They were later woven into our dreams. We tried to check certain points by talking to known cult leaders. But we never managed to make the right links.\n###\nSuch was the background of intertwined legend and hallucination. When, around 1920, I had my researches in coherent shape, I felt a slight lessening of the tension which their earlier stages had increased.

Any chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the amnesia\u2014and then I read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient and ill-regarded cults.

Finally, aftre looking at the groups carefully, all the gathered leaders made a sound together. They began giivng quick orders to the crowds of ghouls and night-gaunts. A large group of the horned flyers left immediately. The rest formed pairs on their knees with their front legs stretched out. They waited for the ghouls to come one by one. Each ghoul went to his assigned pair of night-gaunts. He was picked up and carried away into darkness. Soon, the whole crowd was gone except for the observer, Pickman, the other leaders. A few pairs of night-gaunts. Pickman said that night-gaunst are the front guard and war horses for the ghouls. He said the army was going out to Sarkomand to fight the moon-beasts.

Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name. Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly\u2014one almost fancied increasingly\u2014similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall. Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwen\u2019s burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \u201c10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Field\u2019s grave in ye\u2014\u201d. The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Field\u2019s grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished.

Their shapes showed with clarity without binoculars. We were abvoe the hills. We could see among the snow, ice. areas of the flatland a couple of spots. We believed these were Lake 's camp and drill site. The hills stood five to six miles. They formed a rnage from the line of than peaks behind them. Ropesbegan to descend toward the spot. Its size indicated it was the camp. As he did this, McTighe sent the message the world would get from our trip. Everyone, of course, has read the. news reports from the rest of our stay. Some hours after landing we sent a report of the tragedy we discovered. We announced the loss of the Lake group by the wind of the day. The night before that. Eleven confirmed, Gedney missing. People excused our lack of details. They understood the shock the event must have given us. They believed us when we said the wind 's force made all eleven bodies to transport., I think that in our distress, confusion. Soul - grippign fear, we strayed from the truth in any case. The importance lies in what we could not tellall shelters, it seems, had been built in a. state \u2014 was crushed to dust. The derrick at the drill site was shkaen. The metal of the planes. Drilling equipment was scratched to a finish. Two of the tents were crushed despite their snow walls.\n###\nAs the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again, and saw that our journey\u2019s end was not far off. The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzyingly up like a fearsome rampart of giants, their curious regularities shewing with startling clearness even without a field-glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and could see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which we took to be Lake\u2019s camp and boring. The higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away, forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan peaks beyond them. At length Ropes\u2014the student who had relieved McTighe at the controls\u2014began to head downward toward the left-hand dark spot whose size marked it as the camp. As he did so, McTighe sent out the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expedition. Everyone, of course, has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of the rest of our antarctic sojourn. Some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we found, and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole Lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day, or of the night before that. Eleven known dead, young Gedney missing. People pardoned our hazy lack of details through realisation of the shock the sad event must have caused us, and believed us when we explained that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside. Indeed, I flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress, utter bewilderment, and soul-clutching horror, we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance. The tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tell\u2014what I would not tell now but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrors. It is a fact that the wind had wrought dreadful havoc. Whether all could have lived through it, even without the other thing, is gravely open to doubt. The storm, with its fury of madly driven ice-particles, must have been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before. One a\u00ebroplane shelter\u2014all, it seems, had been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate state\u2014was nearly pulverised; and the derrick at the distant boring was entirely shaken to pieces. The exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish, and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow banking."}

He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and recalled the old Sunday stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there. Unseen things not of earth\u2014or at least not of tri-dimensional earth\u2014rushed foetid and horrible through New England\u2019s glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain-tops. Of this he had long felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He locked away the Necronomicon with a shudder of disgust, but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. \u201cAs a foulness shall ye know them,\u201d he quoted. Yes\u2014the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous, once again, and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentage. \u201cInbreeding?\u201d Armitage muttered half-aloud to himself. \u201cGreat God, what simpletons! Shew them Arthur Machen\u2019s Great God Pan and they\u2019ll think it a common Dunwich scandal! But what thing\u2014what cursed shapeless influence on or off this three-dimensioned earth\u2014was Wilbur Whateley\u2019s father? Born on Candlemas\u2014nine months after May-Eve of 1912, when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham\u2014 What walked on the mountains that May-Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half-human flesh and blood?\u201d During the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible data on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He got in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the grandfather\u2019s last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear."}

One looked back again. The exact reason was perhpas just the old instinct of the hunted to judge its hunter. Or perhaps it was an automatic try to answer a question from the senses. One was running away. All focus was on escaping. One was not able to wtach and study details. But still, some part of the brain must have questionde what the nose told it. Afterward it is understood. One had moved away from the foul slime on those headless blocks. chasing thing had come closer. Logic sadi the smells should have swapped. But they did not. Near the fallen things, that new, strange bad smell had been very strong. By nwo, it should have mostly been replaced by the unknown stink linked to those others. This did not happen. Instead, the newer, worse smell is now seen to be almost pure. It grows stronger and more poisonous every second.\n###\nOur exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the immemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course of its pursuer; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a subconscious question raised by one of our senses. In the midst of our flight, with all our faculties centred on the problem of escape, we were in no condition to observe and analyse details; yet even so our latent brain-cells must have wondered at the message brought them by our nostrils. Afterward we realised what it was\u2014that our retreat from the foetid slime-coating on those headless obstructions, and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity, had not brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for. In the neighbourhood of the prostrate things that new and lately unexplainable foetor had been wholly dominant; but by this time it ought to have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with those others. This it had not done\u2014for instead, the newer and less bearable smell was now virtually undiluted, and growing more and more poisonously insistent each second."}

Then the glimmer of the lamp on the varnish caught my eye. It had cast unclear shadows across the wood grain several times earlier that evening. But now it showed with unusual sharpness. At times it lit a mark that had many qualities of a purposeful cut. I focsued my attention directly on it and found its pattern was unclear. Looking from the other side of the board, I aimed the light again to see if it looked ordered in any way. What I saw disturbed me very much, which was surprising given its minor nature. It must have been just linking any odd detail with the forgotten history of our home. Its past residents. Surely the deatil itself was not terrible or unnatural. It was simply that the table's damaged surface, changed no doubt by normal use that home life requires, showed great age. It did not seem at all typical of how it was made. Its original look was one of smooth, even polish. Now, a range of marks seemed gathered on it. I think, overall, it was this variety that mainly unsettled me. The tabletop, as it shimmered. Moved in the unsteady light, with grooves now clearly visible, seemed not one surface. It suggested a curious quality of being foreign to its first state.\n###\nThen the glimmering of the lamplight upon the varnish attracted my notice. It had cast uncertain shadows across the grain several times during the latter half of the evening, but now it was revealing with unusual clarity, occasionally illuminating a mark which held more than a few of the qualities of a deliberate incision. I turned my attention directly upon it and found its pattern obscured, so bending and peering from the other side of the board, I again directed the light to see if it seemed in any way ordered. What I beheld disquieted me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality. It must have been merely the association of any odd detail with the forgotten history of our domicile and its prior inhabitants, for surely the detail was not in itself dreadful or unnatural. It was merely that the table\u2019s marred complexion, altered no doubt by the common usage which domestic life necessitates, betrayed considerable antiquity, and seemed not at all characteristic of its manufacture. Its intended aspect was one of smooth and uniform polish, whereas now a variety of defacements seemed accumulated upon it. I think, on the whole, that it was this variety which chiefly unsettled me. The table-top, as it shimmered and shifted in the wavering illumination and with grooves that had now stood starkly revealed, seemed not one surface but many, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from its original state."}

Another problem is that we are not true specialists in the main fields involved. As geologists, our goal for leading the Miskatonic University Expedition was only to get deep rock. Soil samples from different parts of Antarctica. We used a special drill made by Prof. Frank H. Pabodie from our engineering department made it. We did not want to be pioneers in any other area. But we hoped this new machine would find materials at places along known routes. Ordinary collection methods could not reach these materials before. As our reports show, Pabodie's drill was very new. It was light, portable, and combined a water well drill with a small rock drill. It could handle layers of different hardness quickly. The Steel head, connected rods, gasoline motor, folding wooden tower, blasting tools, rope, waste-removal drill. Pipe sections for holes five inches wide. Up to 1000 feet deep, plus needed parts, were not too heavy. Three sleds pulled by seven dgos each could carry it all. This was possible because of a smart aluminum alloy used for most metal parts. Four large Dornier airplanes were specially made for the high-altitude flying needed on the antarctic plateau. Pabodie added devices to warm the fuel and start the engines quickly. These planes could move our wohle team from a base at the great ice barrier to good inland spots. From these spots, enouhg dogs would be available for us.\n###\nIt is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, specialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned. As a geologist my object in leading the Miskatonic University Expedition was wholly that of securing deep-level specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent, aided by the remarkable drill devised by Prof. Frank H. Pabodie of our engineering department. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this; but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection. Pabodie\u2019s drilling apparatus, as the public already knows from our reports, was unique and radical in its lightness, portability, and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness. Steel head, jointed rods, gasoline motor, collapsible wooden derrick, dynamiting paraphernalia, cording, rubbish-removal auger, and sectional piping for bores five inches wide and up to 1000 feet deep all formed, with needed accessories, no greater load than three seven-dog sledges could carry; this being made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned. Four large Dornier a\u00ebroplanes, designed especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added fuel-warming and quick-starting devices worked out by Pabodie, could transport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points, and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve us."}

In this way, he became a type of humorist. He did not see that humor is in a universe without thought, a universe that lacks any standard for what makes sense. Does not make sense. In the days of his feeling trapped, he turned to the faith of the church. This faith was to him because of the trust of his ancestors. From it, he saw paths taht seemed to offer an escape from life. when he looked did he notice the lack of imagination and beauty. He saw the,, and nature of it. He saw the. claims of truth that ruled in a boring. Overpowering way among of its followers. He felt the clumsiness with which it tried to keep, as fact, the fears. Guesses of people facing the. It tired Carter to see how people tried to make - world truth from myths. Every step of their science disproved these myths. This kind of seriousness destroyed the connection he might have kept for the beliefs. He might have kept it if they had been to offer the ceremonies. releases in their form of light, airy fantasy. When he came to study those who had rejected the myths, he found them than those who had not. They did not know that beauty exists in harmony. They did not know that the loveliness of life has no standard in a universe. Its standard is its harmony with the dreams. Feelings that came. shaped our worlds from the remaining chaos. They did not see that. Ugliness are results of point of view. Their value lies in their connection to what chance made our ancestors think. Their details are for every race and every culture., they either denied these thnigs. Moved them to the, instincts they shared with animals. Because of this, their lives were dragged out in a - smelling way through pain, ugliness. Lack of balance. Their lives were filled with a pride at having escaped from something no than what controlled them. They had exchanged the gods of fear. Unthinking respect for the gdos of freedom. Carter did not experience of these freedoms. Their quality and dirtiness sickened a spirit that loved beauty. At the time, his reason fought against the logic their supporters used. They tried to cover imuplse with a sacredness taken from the idols they had thrown.\n###\nIn this way he became a kind of humorist, for he did not see that even humour is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true standard of consistency or inconsistency. In the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly faith endeared to him by the naive trust of his fathers, for thence stretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from life. Only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty, the stale and prosy triteness, and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown. It wearied Carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted, and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy. But when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths, he found them even more ugly than those who had not. They did not know that beauty lies in harmony, and that loveliness of life has no standard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the dreams and the feelings which have gone before and blindly moulded our little spheres out of the rest of chaos. They did not see that good and evil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective, whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers think and feel, and whose finer details are different for every race and culture. Instead, they either denied these things altogether or transferred them to the crude, vague instincts which they shared with the beasts and peasants; so that their lives were dragged malodorously out in pain, ugliness, and disproportion, yet filled with a ludicrous pride at having escaped from something no more unsound than that which still held them. They had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety for those of licence and anarchy. Carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their cheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone, while his reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions tried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had discarded."}

In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house\u2014a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent\u2014and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling. It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charles\u2019s third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the company\u2019s motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimney\u2019s course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \u201cJournall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\u201d Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him.

One quickly flees from a few other things. One cannot be very sure about those other things. The stench-filled houses had furniture. Most of it was grotesque stolos and benches. They were carved from moon-trees. The insides were painted with nameless and frantic designs. Countless weapons, tools, and ornaments lay around. This included some idols made of solid ruby. They showed beings not found on earth. These idols did not invite taking or looking, despite being made of ruby. It is recorded that five of them were hammered into very pieces.

Carter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive, and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive. The stench-filled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from moon-trees, and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs. Countless weapons, implements, and ornaments lay about; including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the earth. These latter did not, despite their material, invite either appropriation or long inspection; and Carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces. The scattered spears and javelins he collected, and with Pickman\u2019s approval distributed among the ghouls. Such devices were new to the dog-like lopers, but their relative simplicity made them easy to master after a few concise hints."}

It was scarlet and evil. It poured from the strange anceint ruin on the far small island. I can not describe how that ruin looked. I must have been crazy. It seemed to rise tall and not decayed. It was splendid and surrounded by columns. The flame - reflecting marble of its upper part pierced the [THING] like the top of a temple on a [THING] peak. Flutes shrieked and drums began to beat. As I watched with awe and terror, I thought I saw dark dancing shapes. They were outlined strangely against the vision of marble and bright light. The effect was huge and unthinkable. I might have stared forever. But the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger on my left. With a fear oddly mixed with great joy, I crossed the round [THING] to the north [THING]. From there I could see the [THING] and flat land at the swamp 's edge. There my eyes widened again with wild wonder. It was as great as if I had not just turned from a scnee beyond normal limits. On the ghostly red - lit plain, a line of beings was moving. They moved in a way no one ever saw before except in bad dream.s Gliding, half floating in the air, the white swamp - ghosts were slowly moving back. They went toward the still waters and the island ruin. Their formations were strange and suggested some ancient, serious ceremonial dance. Their waving see - through arms moved in a creepy rhythm. They were guided by the hateful piping of unseen flutes. They beckoned to a crowd of stumbling workers who followed like dogs. The workers had blind, mindless, clumsy steps. They seemed pulled by a strong demon - will. As the [THING] spirits neared the swamp, a new line of staggering [THING] came out. They came drunkenly from the castle from some [THING] far below my [THING]. They felt their way blindly across courtyard and through part of the [THING]. They joined the stumbling line of workers on the plain. Because they were far below me, I knew at once they were the servants brought frmo the north. I recognized the ugly, clumsy shape of the cook. His silliness had now become unbelievably tragic. The flutes piped horribly. Again I heard drums beating from the direction of the island ruin. Then silently and gracefully, the [THING] spirits reached [THING]. They melted one by one into the ancient swamp. The line of followers never slowed. They splashed awkwardly after them and vanished. They vanished in a small wihrlpool of unhealthy bubbles. I could barely see the bubbles in the scarlet light.\n###\nOver the bog was a deluge of flaring light, scarlet and sinister, and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet. The aspect of that ruin I cannot describe\u2014I must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column-cinctured, the flame-reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain-top. Flutes shrieked and drums began to beat, and as I watched in awe and terror I thought I saw dark saltant forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and effulgence. The effect was titanic\u2014altogether unthinkable\u2014and I might have stared indefinitely had not the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger at my left. Trembling with a terror oddly mixed with ecstasy I crossed the circular room to the north window from which I could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog. There my eyes dilated again with a wild wonder as great as if I had not just turned from a scene beyond the pale of Nature, for on the ghastly red-litten plain was moving a procession of beings in such a manner as none ever saw before save in nightmares. Half gliding, half floating in the air, the white-clad bog-wraiths were slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial dance. Their waving translucent arms, guided by the detestable piping of those unseen flutes, beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of lurching labourers who followed dog-like with blind, brainless, floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless daemon-will. As the naiads neared the bog, without altering their course, a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window, groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village, and joined the floundering column of labourers on the plain. Despite their distance below me I at once knew they were the servants brought from the north, for I recognised the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook, whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic. The flutes piped horribly, and again I heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the island ruin. Then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one into the ancient bog; while the line of followers, never checking their speed, splashed awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which I could barely see in the scarlet light."}

Then Zann was seen to jump as if from a bad shock. Unmistakably he was looking at the window with curtains and listneing with fear. Then it seemed that a sound might be heard. It was not a terrible sound. It was very soft and very far away musical note. It suggested a player in a nearby house. In a home beyond the hihg wall that one could never see over. Upon Zann reacted terribly. He dropped his pencil suddenly. He stood up. He grabbed his viol. He began to fill the night with the wildest playing ever heard from his bow.

Then I half fancied I heard a sound myself; though it was not a horrible sound, but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely distant musical note, suggesting a player in one of the neighbouring houses, or in some abode beyond the lofty wall over which I had never been able to look. Upon Zann the effect was terrible, for dropping his pencil suddenly he rose, seized his viol, and commenced to rend the night with the wildest playing I had ever heard from his bow save when listening at the barred door."}

This huge dark gulf was certainly formed by the great river. The river flowed down from the unnamed and horrible mountains to the west. It used to turn at the bottom of the Old Ones' mountain range. It then flowed next to that range into the Indian Ocean. This is between Budd and Totten Lands on Wilkes's coast. Little by little, it wore away the limestone base of the hill at its turn. Fnially, its eroding flow reached the caves of the underground water. It joined with them to dig a deeper hole. Finally its entire flow went into the hollow hills. This left the old riverbed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later city, as the writer now found it, had been built oevr that old riverbed. The Old Oens undrestood what happened. Using their always sharp artistic sense, they carved the foothill headlands into decorated towers. This was where the great river started to go down into endless darkness.\n###\nThis vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains, and which had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones\u2019 range and flowed beside that chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten Lands on Wilkes\u2019s coast-line. Little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning, till at last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in digging a deeper abyss. Finally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later city as we now found it had been built over that former bed. The Old Ones, understanding what had happened, and exercising their always keen artistic sense, had carved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the great stream began its descent into eternal darkness."}

Examining one day the reserve specimens, my eye was caught by an picture. The specimens were roughly set on the storage shelves. They were in a rear room of the museum. The picture was in one of the papers spread beneath the stones. It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned. My friend has affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts.

It was the Sydney Bulletin I have mentioned, for my friend has wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts; and the picture was a half-tone cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which Legrasse had found in the swamp. Eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents, I scanned the item in detail; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length. What it suggested, however, was of portentous significance to my flagging quest; and I carefully tore it out for immediate action. It read as follows: MYSTERY DERELICT FOUND AT SEA. Vigilant Arrives With Helpless Armed New Zealand Yacht in Tow. One Survivor and Dead Man Found Aboard. Tale of Desperate Battle and Deaths at Sea. Rescued Seaman Refuses Particulars of Strange Experience. Odd Idol Found in His Possession. Inquiry to Follow. The Morrison Co.\u2019s freighter Vigilant, bound from Valparaiso, arrived this morning at its wharf in Darling Harbour, having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht Alert of Dunedin, N. Z., which was sighted April 12th in S. Latitude 34\u00b0 21', W. Longitude 152\u00b0 17' with one living and one dead man aboard. The Vigilant left Valparaiso March 25th, and on April 2nd was driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves. On April 12th the derelict was sighted; and though apparently deserted, was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a half-delirious condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week. The living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin, about a foot in height, regarding whose nature authorities at Sydney University, the Royal Society, and the Museum in College Street all profess complete bafflement, and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht, in a small carved shrine of common pattern. This man, after recovering his senses, told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter. He is Gustaf Johansen, a Norwegian of some intelligence, and had been second mate of the two-masted schooner Emma of Auckland, which sailed for Callao February 20th with a complement of eleven men."}

A carving or writing is never found to tell about those men. If they were men, they built the city and lived there long ago. old age of the place is considered unhealthy. There is a desire to find some sign. Object to prove that people made the city. There were some sizes and shapes in the ruins that are not liked. Many tools are available. Much digging is done inside the walls of the destroyed buildings. But progress is slow and nothing important is found. When night and the moon return, a cold wind is felt. It brings new fear, so one does not dare to stay in the city. As one goes outside the old walls to sleep, a small sandstorm with sighing sound is seen forming behind. It blows over the gray stones even though the moon is bright. Most of the desert is calm.\n###\nIn and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and palaces I wandered, finding never a carving or inscription to tell of those men, if men they were, who built the city and dwelt therein so long ago.

There were certain proportions and dimensions in the ruins which I did not like. I had with me many tools, and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices; but progress was slow, and nothing significant was revealed. When night and the moon returned I felt a chill wind which brought new fear, so that I did not dare to remain in the city. And as I went outside the antique walls to sleep, a small sighing sandstorm gathered behind me, blowing over the grey stones though the moon was bright and most of the desert still."}

Confused by a shadow. to fight, had rested without actnig. the notes of Ward to his parents grew and. came the of the month with its adjustments. The clerks at banks began a shaking of heads. Telephoning from one to the. Officials who knew Charles Ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every check of his appearing at this time was a fake. They were reassured than they ought to have been when the man explained that his hand had been. affected by a shock as to make writing. He could, he said, form no written letters except with difficulty. He could prove it by the fatc that he had been forced to type all his letters, those to his father. Mother, who would confirm statement. What made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance. That was nothing or. Nor was it the Pawtuxet gossip, of which one. Two of them had heard echoes. It was the talk of the man which puzzled them. It ipmlied a loss of memory concerning money matters which he had had at his fingertips a month. Something was. Despite the logic. Reason of his speech, there could be no reason for this hidden blankness on points. None of these men knew Ward, they could not help observing the change in his language. They had heard he was a person who studies things. the students of tihngs do not make use of phrases., this combination of hoarseness, hands, memory. Behavior must represent some problem. Sickness of seriousness. This no formed the basis of the rumors. After their departure the group of officials decided that a talk with the Ward was. On the of March, 1928, there was a. meeting in Mr. Ward 's office. After this the father called Dr. Willett in a kind of acceptance.\n###\nAnd yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Ward\u2019s or Dr. Willett\u2019s that the next move in this singular case proceeded. The father and the physician, rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat, had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young Ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer. Then came the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments, and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other. Officials who knew Charles Ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery, and were reassurred less than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible. He could, he said, form no written characters at all except with great difficulty; and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters, even those to his father and mother, who would bear out the assertion. What made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone, for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious; nor even the Pawtuxet gossip, of which one or two of them had caught echoes. It was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them, implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before. Something was wrong; for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech, there could be no normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points. Moreover, although none of these men knew Ward well, they could not help observing the change in his language and manner. They had heard he was an antiquarian, but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures. Altogether, this combination of hoarseness, palsied hands, bad memory, and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity, which no doubt formed the basis of the prevailing odd rumours; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with the senior Ward was imperative. So on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference in Mr. Ward\u2019s office, after which the utterly bewildered father summoned Dr. Willett in a kind of helpless resignation."}

He noted the amounts of different chemicals on the shelves. This suggested young Ward's main interest was in a part of organic chemistry. Overall, little could be learned from the collection of scientific items. It included a dissecting table that looked gruesome. So the room was rather disappointing. Among the books was an old torn copy of Borellus. It was in black-letter print. It was strangely interesting to noet that Ward had underlined the same passage. The marking of this passage had troubled Mr. Merritt long ago. Tihs was at Curwen's farmhouse more than one hundred and fifty years before. That older copy must have been destroyed. It was lost with the rest of Curwen's occult library in the final raid. Three archways led out of the laboratory. The chronicler examined these one by one. From a quick look, he saw two led only to small storerooms. But he checked these carefully. He noted piles of coffins in different states of damage. He shuddered strongly at two or trhee coffin-plates he could read. Much clothing was also stored in these rooms. There weer several new boxes nailed tightly shut. He did not stop to investigate these. Perhaps most interesting were some odd pieces. He judged them to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen's laboratory equipment. These had been damaged by the raiders. But they were still partly recognizable as chemical equipment from the Georgian period.\n###\nAfter lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Ward\u2019s dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwen\u2019s farmhouse more than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwen\u2019s occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen\u2019s laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period."}

His household had seven servants and nine cats. He likes cats very much. His oldest cat, \"Nigger-Man\", was seven years ancient. It came with him from his home in Bolton, Massachusetts. He got the other cats while living with Capt. Norrys' family during the priory restoration. For five days, their routine was very calm. He spent most of his time organizing old family information. He now had detailed accounts of the final tragedy. Escape of Walter de la Poer. He thought this was probably the content of the family paper lost in the fire at Carfax. It seems his ancestor was accused, with good reason, of killing all other members of his household. He spared four servant helpers. They were killed in their sleep. This happened about two weeks after a shocking discovery. The discovery changed his whole behavior. He did not tell anyone about it, except maybe the servants who helped him. Those sevrants later fled and could not be found.\n###\nAs I have said, I moved in on July 16, 1923. My household consisted of seven servants and nine cats, of which latter species I am particularly fond. My eldest cat, \u201cNigger-Man\u201d, was seven years old and had come with me from my home in Bolton, Massachusetts; the others I had accumulated whilst living with Capt. Norrys\u2019 family during the restoration of the priory. For five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity, my time being spent mostly in the codification of old family data. I had now obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and flight of Walter de la Poer, which I conceived to be the probable contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at Carfax. It appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having killed all the other members of his household, except four servant confederates, in their sleep, about two weeks after a shocking discovery which changed his whole demeanour, but which, except by implication, he disclosed to no one save perhaps the servants who assisted him and afterward fled beyond reach."}

My ancestor thought that human will has very special qualities. These qualities have a hidden power. This powre affects not only one's own actions and the actions of others. It also affects every kind of force and substance in Nature. It affects many elements and dimensions considered more universal than Nature itself. Some might say he did not respect things as great as space and time. He used the rituals of certain mixed-race red Indians poeple in strange ways. These people once camped on this hill. These Indians became angry when this place was built. They were very annoying in asking to visit the grounds during the full moon. For years, they climbed over the wall each month when possible. They secretly performed certain acts. Then, in 1768, the new squire caught them doing these things. He stood still at what he saw. After that, he made a deal with them. He gave them free access to his grounds. In return, they told him exactly what they did. He learned that their grandfathers got part of their practice from red ancestors. Another part came from an old Dutchman from the time of the States-General. It is feared the squire must have given them bad rum. This might have been on purpose or not. A week after he learned the secret, he was the only living person who knew it. You, Sir, you are first outsider to be told there is a secret. writer would not have risked interfering. Much with the powers if you had not been. Eager for past things.\n###\n\u201cTo\u2014my ancestor\u2014\u201d he softly continued, \u201cthere appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind; qualities having a little-suspected dominance not only over the acts of one\u2019s self and of others, but over every variety of force and substance in Nature, and over many elements and dimensions deemed more univarsal than Nature herself. May I say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time, and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain half-breed red Indians once encamped upon this hill? These Indians shewed choler when the place was built, and were plaguy pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon. For years they stole over the wall each month when they could, and by stealth performed sartain acts. Then, in \u201968, the new squire catched them at their doings, and stood still at what he saw. Thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did; larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old Dutchman in the time of the States-General. And pox on him, I\u2019m afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum\u2014whether or not by intent\u2014for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it.

It was first used in England and then in the United States. The phrase was very complex and clearly new. It repeated every small detail of the confusing wrods spoken by the strange Arkham patient in 1908. Physical strength came back immediately. I needed a lot of unusual re - training to use my hands, legs. My whole [THING] again. Because of this. Other problems caused by the memory loss, I was kept under strict medical care for some time. I saw that my tries to hide the memory loss did not work. So I admitted it openly. I then became very eager to learn all kinds of information. In fact, the doctors thought I lost interest in my own real personality as soon as they accepted the amnesia as a natural fact. They noticed my main efforts were to learn certain points in history, science, art, language. Some points were very hard to understand. Some were very simple, like a [THING] 's lesson. Very oddl,y in many cases, this knowledge was completely missing from my mind. At the same time, they noticed I had an unexplainable knowledge of many almost unknown subjects. I seemed to want to hide this knowledge, not show it. I would accidentally talk about specific events in ancient times, outside regular history. I spoke with casual confidence. When I saw the surprise this caused, I would say it was just a joke. I also had a way of talking about the future. This caused real fright two or three times. These strange moments of knowledge soon stopped happening. Some observers thought they stopped because I became secretly careful, not because the strange knowledge faded. Indeed, I seemed unusually eager to learn the speech, customs. Views of the age around me. It was as if I were a serious traveler from a very far, foreign [THING]. As soon as I was allowed, I spent all my time at the college library. I soon began to plan those odd travels. Special courses at American. These plans caused much talk during the next few years. I never lacked for educated [THING] to talk to. My case was somewhat famous among the psychologists of that time.\n###\nOf the latter one in particular was very potently\u2014even terrifiedly\u2014recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward. For at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currency\u2014first in England and then in the United States\u2014and though of much complexity and indisputable newness, it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham patient of 1908. Physical strength returned at once, although I required an odd amount of re-education in the use of my hands, legs, and bodily apparatus in general. Because of this and other handicaps inherent in the mnemonic lapse, I was for some time kept under strict medical care. When I saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed, I admitted it openly, and became eager for information of all sorts. Indeed, it seemed to the doctors that I had lost interest in my proper personality as soon as I found the case of amnesia accepted as a natural thing. They noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history, science, art, language, and folklore\u2014some of them tremendously abstruse, and some childishly simple\u2014which remained, very oddly in many cases, outside my consciousness. At the same time they noticed that I had an inexplicable command of many almost unknown sorts of knowledge\u2014a command which I seemed to wish to hide rather than display. I would inadvertently refer, with casual assurance, to specific events in dim ages outside the range of accepted history\u2014passing off such references as a jest when I saw the surprise they created. And I had a way of speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright. These uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear, though some observers laid their vanishment more to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of the strange knowledge behind them. Indeed, I seemed anomalously avid to absorb the speech, customs, and perspectives of the age around me; as if I were a studious traveller from a far, foreign land. As soon as permitted, I haunted the college library at all hours; and shortly began to arrange for those odd travels, and special courses at American and European universities, which evoked so much comment during the next few years. I did not at any time suffer from a lack of learned contacts, for my case had a mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period."}

We had bits of shouted conversation above the wind 's piping and the engine 's buzzing. This was as we reached the side of the mountain range. Swooped toward the camp. That talk had to do with the promises of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city. things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss.

Danforth,, is known to be among the who have dared to read through that worm - eaten copy of the Necronomicon. It is kept under lock and key in the college library. The sky, as we crossed the range, was and disturbed. I did not see the top of the sky, I can imagine its swirls of ice - dust may have taken forms.\n###\nI have said that Danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanely\u2014a horror which, I feel sadly sure, is mainly responsible for his present breakdown. We had snatches of shouted conversation above the wind\u2019s piping and the engine\u2019s buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp, but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city. Certain things, we had agreed, were not for people to know and discuss lightly\u2014and I would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that Starkweather-Moore Expedition, and others, at any cost. It is absolutely necessary, for the peace and safety of mankind, that some of earth\u2019s dark, dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life, and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests. All that Danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage. It was not, he declares, anything connected with the cubes and caves of echoing, vaporous, wormily honeycombed mountains of madness which we crossed; but a single fantastic, daemoniac glimpse, among the churning zenith-clouds, of what lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the Old Ones had shunned and feared. It is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born of the previous stresses we had passed through, and of the actual though unrecognised mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near Lake\u2019s camp the day before; but it was so real to Danforth that he suffers from it still. He has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about \u201cthe black pit\u201d, \u201cthe carven rim\u201d, \u201cthe proto-shoggoths\u201d, \u201cthe windowless solids with five dimensions\u201d, \u201cthe nameless cylinder\u201d, \u201cthe elder pharos\u201d, \u201cYog-Sothoth\u201d, \u201cthe primal white jelly\u201d, \u201cthe colour out of space\u201d, \u201cthe wings\u201d, \u201cthe eyes in darkness\u201d, \u201cthe moon-ladder\u201d, \u201cthe original, the eternal, the undying\u201d, and other bizarre conceptions; but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years. Danforth, indeed, is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that worm-riddled copy of the Necronomicon kept under lock and key in the college library. The higher sky, as we crossed the range, was surely vaporous and disturbed enough; and although I did not see the zenith I can well imagine that its swirls of ice-dust may have taken strange forms."}

The dead man was young, somewhat dark, and very good-looking. He was probably from Italian or Greek. He was certainly part of the Victory's crew. Evidently, he had looked for safety on the same ship that had to sink his own. He was another person hurt by unfair war of attack that the English are fighting. The men checked his body for keepsake.s In his cota pocket, they found a very strange piece of ivory. It was carved to look like a young man's head with a laurel crown. Lieut. Klenze thought the item was very old and valuable as art. So it was taken away from the men. No one could guess how a regular sailor got it.\n###\nWhen we rose to the surface about sunset a seaman\u2019s body was found on the deck, hands gripping the railing in curious fashion.

He had evidently sought refuge on the very ship which had been forced to destroy his own\u2014one more victim of the unjust war of aggression which the English pig-dogs are waging upon the Fatherland. Our men searched him for souvenirs, and found in his coat pocket a very odd bit of ivory carved to represent a youth\u2019s head crowned with laurel. My fellow-officer, Lieut. Klenze, believed that the thing was of great age and artistic value, so took it from the men for himself.

This time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realised the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or lesser time, as the future would shew. The readiness with which I fell into a plan of action proves that I must have been subconsciously fearing some menace and considering possible avenues of escape for hours. From the first I felt that the unseen fumbler meant a danger not to be met or dealt with, but only to be fled from as precipitately as possible. The one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as I could, and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby. Rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch, I sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift, valiseless flight. Nothing, however, happened; and I saw that the power had been cut off. Clearly, some cryptic, evil movement was afoot on a large scale\u2014just what, I could not say. As I stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch I heard a muffled creaking on the floor below, and thought I could barely distinguish voices in conversation. A moment later I felt less sure that the deeper sounds were voices, since the apparent hoarse barkings and loose-syllabled croakings bore so little resemblance to recognised human speech. Then I thought with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential building. Having filled my pockets with the flashlight\u2019s aid, I put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent. Despite the state\u2019s safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel, and I saw that my windows commanded only a sheer three-story drop to the cobbled courtyard. On the right and left, however, some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel; their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my fourth-story level. To reach either of these lines of buildings I would have to be in a room two doors from my own\u2014in one case on the north and in the other case on the south\u2014and my mind instantly set to work calculating what chances I had of making the transfer."}

My wife and I normally ate breakfast at different times. It was during my alone meal, around seven in the morning, that Tuesday, that the fire started. The two last pieces of bread, thniking I was not paying attention, had suddenly exploded in a crazy anger. This was because I refused to deal with the toaster a few minutes before. They were now in a wild state of turning black and burning. They smoked like the burned things they were becoming. They filled the kitchen with a sharp and dusty cloud. They crackled about silly things like the curse of the uneven heating part. They also crackled about the dead bits that fell from them and spread around. My wife seemed frozen and not helpful. This is what you might expect from a sleepy person. I took out both pieces because I had to. I made sure that none of it was still to eat.\n###\nMy wife and I usually breakfasted at different hours; and it was during my solitary repast, about 7 A.M., that Tuesday, that the general conflagration commenced.

They smoked like the charred things they were becoming, and filled the kitchen with an acrid and particulate haze; crackling about such absurdities as the curse of the uneven heating element and the dark, dead crumbs which fell from them and were scattered. My spouse seemed paralysed and inefficient, as one might expect of a soft, somnolent sleeper. I extracted both slices, for it was necessary, and made sure that none remained edible."}

Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means."}

Some rough homes were even dug into the side of the first hill. Geographically it sat about two miles northwest of the base of Tempest Mountain. Three miles from mansion surrounded by oaks. Of the space beetween the village. The mansion, over two miles on tthe vvillage side was completely open land. The plain was fairly flat except for some low snake-like mounds. Only had grass. Scattered weedss as plants. Considering this land shape, we had fnially decided the demoon must have come through Cone Mountain. A wooded southern extension of it reached close to the westernmost part of Tempest Mountain. We traced the raisedd ground clearly to a landsilde from Maple Hill. A tall, lone, split tere on its side had been hit by the lightning bolt that called the fieend.\n###\nThe ill-fated squatter hamlet had borne no name, but had long stood in a sheltered though treeless cleft between two elevations called respectively Cone Mountain and Maple Hill. It was closer to Maple Hill than to Cone Mountain, some of the crude abodes indeed being dugouts on the side of the former eminence. Geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the base of Tempest Mountain, and three miles from the oak-girt mansion. Of the distance between the hamlet and the mansion, fully two miles and a quarter on the hamlet\u2019s side was entirely open country; the plain being of fairly level character save for some of the low snake-like mounds, and having as vegetation only grass and scattered weeds. Considering this topography, we had finally concluded that the daemon must have come by way of Cone Mountain, a wooded southern prolongation of which ran to within a short distance of the westernmost spur of Tempest Mountain. The upheaval of ground we traced conclusively to a landslide from Maple Hill, a tall lone splintered tree on whose side had been the striking point of the thunderbolt which summoned the fiend."}

That night, travelers left Ulthar and were never seen again. The homeowners weer worried when we noticed that no cat could be found in the whole village. The familiar cat had disappeared from every home. Cats large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow, and white were gone. Old Kranon, the mayor, said that the dark travelers had taken the cats as revenge for killing Menes' kitten. He cursed the tarvelers and the little boy. But Nith, the thin lawyer, said that the old framer. His wife were more likely suspects. Their hatred of cats was well known and growing bolder. Still, we did not dare to complain to the scary couple. This was even after little Atal, the innkeeper's son, said that at dusk we saw all the cats of Ulthar in that cusred yard under the trees. He said they walked very slowly. Seriously in a circle around the cottage, two side by sied. It was as if they were performing some unkonwn animal ceremony.

Newspapers reported that the sihp left Boston Harbour on September 2, 1930. It sailed slowly down the coast and through the Panama Canal. It stopped at Samoa, Hobart, and Tasmania. Final supplies were taken at Tasmania. None of the explorers had been to the polar regions before. So they relied heavily on the ship captains. J. B. Douglas commanded the brig Arkham and led the sea party. Georg Thorfinnssen commanded the barque Miskatonic. Both were experienced whalers in antarctic waters. As they left the inhabited world, the sun sank lower in the north each day. It stayed longer above the horizon. Near 62\u00b0 South Latitud,e they saw the first iceberg.s The icbeergs were flat with vertical sides. Before reaching the Antarctic Circle, they had trouble with field ice. They crossde the Antarctic Circle on October 20 with special ceremonies. The temperature fell after the trip through the tropics. They tried to prepare for worse conditions ahead. They often saw curious atmospheric effects. These were very enchanting. One was a very vivid mirage. It was the first of its kind they noted. In it, distant icebergs looked like battlements of cosmic castles.\n###\nAs the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbour on September 2, 1930; taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter place we took on final supplies.

He had fallen in a kind of fit which gave his black - clothed body a stiffness. I think he was nearing forty years. There were lines in his face. It was and -, but oval and. There were bits of grey in the, hair and beard. These had been the raven. His forehead was as the marble of Pentelicus. It was of a height and width like a god \u2019s. I said to myself, with all the passion of a sculptor, that this man was a faun \u2019s statue from Hellas. It was dug from a temple \u2019s ruins. Brought to life in our stifling age. It was to feel the cold and pressure of destroying years. When he opened his, - set. eyes I knew he would be from on my friend. He would be the friend of one who had had a friend. I saw that eyes must have looked upon the greatness. The terror of places beyond awareness. These were places I had held in imagination, but searched for in. As I sent the crowd I told him he must come with me. He must be my teacher and guide in mysteries. He agreed wihtout speaking a word. I found taht his voice was music. It was the music of string instruments and of spheres. We talked at night, and in the day. During the day, I carved busts of him and made heads in ivory. I did this to make his expressions. Of our studies it is to speak. They had connection with anything of the world as living men understand it. They were of that and universe of being and awareness. This lies than matter, time, and space. We suspect its existence in forms of sleep. These are those dreams beyond dreams which come to men. They come or in the lifetime of men. The cosmos of our waking knowledge is born from such a universe. It is born as a bubble is born from the pipe of a jester. It touches it as such a bubble may touch its mocking source. This happens when it is sucked by the jester \u2019s idea. Men of learning suspect it, and ignore it.\n###\nHe was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight black-clad body a strange rigidity. I think he was then approaching forty years of age, for there were deep lines in the face, wan and hollow-cheeked, but oval and actually beautiful; and touches of grey in the thick, waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black. His brow was white as the marble of Pentelicus, and of a height and breadth almost godlike. I said to myself, with all the ardour of a sculptor, that this man was a faun\u2019s statue out of antique Hellas, dug from a temple\u2019s ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years. And when he opened his immense, sunken, and wildly luminous black eyes I knew he would be thenceforth my only friend\u2014the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before\u2014for I saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality; realms which I had cherished in fancy, but vainly sought. So as I drove the crowd away I told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed mysteries, and he assented without speaking a word. Afterward I found that his voice was music\u2014the music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres. We talked often in the night, and in the day, when I chiselled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalise his different expressions. Of our studies it is impossible to speak, since they held so slight a connexion with anything of the world as living men conceive it. They were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper than matter, time, and space, and whose existence we suspect only in certain forms of sleep\u2014those rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common men, and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men. The cosmos of our waking knowledge, born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a jester, touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when sucked back by the jester\u2019s whim. Men of learning suspect it little, and ignore it mostly."}

This was if he woke up confused before dying. But I did put the two ends of my \" radio \" on our heads. I hoped for a and message from the dream - world. There was time left. A nurse was in the cell with us. He was an man. He did not understand the device 's purpose. He did not think to ask about my actions. The hours passed. I saw his head drop in sleep. I did not wake him. The breathing of the man and the dying man calmed me. I msut have nodded off a bit. A, song woke me. Chords, vibrations, and joys echoed. An sight of beauty burst into my view. Walls, columns, and architraves of living fire shone. They wree where I seemed to float. They went up to a dome. The dome had splendor. Along with this palace - display, views appeared. They replaced it in a turning pattern. I saw plains and valleys. I saw mountains and inviting caves. They had every feature I could imagine. They were made of a,, and substacne. This substance was both spirit and matter. I looked and understood. My brain held the key to these changes. Each scene that appeared was the one my changing mind wanted to see. In this realm, I did not feel like a stranger. Every sight and sound was to me. It had been this way for ages. It would be this way for ages to come. the light of my brother of light came. We talked, soul to soul. We exchanged thoughts and. The time was one of coming victory. My fellow being was escaping at. He was leaving a, repetaing bondage. He was getting to follow the oppressor. He would follow to the fields of space., a flaming revenge would be made. This revenge would shake spheres.\n###\nHe was drowsy near the end, and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep. I did not strap on the strait-jacket as was customary when he slept, since I saw that he was too feeble to be dangerous, even if he woke in mental disorder once more before passing away. But I did place upon his head and mine the two ends of my cosmic \u201cradio\u201d; hoping against hope for a first and last message from the dream-world in the brief time remaining. In the cell with us was one nurse, a mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus, or think to inquire into my course. As the hours wore on I saw his head droop awkwardly in sleep, but I did not disturb him. I myself, lulled by the rhythmical breathing of the healthy and the dying man, must have nodded a little later. The sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me. Chords, vibrations, and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand; while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty. Walls, columns, and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where I seemed to float in air; extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendour. Blending with this display of palatial magnificence, or rather, supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation, were glimpses of wide plains and graceful valleys, high mountains and inviting grottoes; covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eye could conceive of, yet formed wholly of some glowing, ethereal, plastic entity, which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter. As I gazed, I perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses; for each vista which appeared to me, was the one my changing mind most wished to behold. Amidst this elysian realm I dwelt not as a stranger, for each sight and sound was familiar to me; just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before, and would be for like eternities to come. Then the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held colloquy with me, soul to soul, with silent and perfect interchange of thought. The hour was one of approaching triumph, for was not my fellow-being escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage; escaping forever, and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether, that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres?"}

I grabbed the handle of the coffee pot wtih a not very steady hand. I saw the feared shape of a witness on the nearby counter. Surely the routine was in danger. My method was found out. The goal of my morning preparations was revealed. person did not speak to me. I hurried to the kettle, trying to hear what she might tell my tired wife. Were were my careful steps with the dark beans about to be told to the whole house? Imagine my happy surprise on hearing the watcher tell my partner in a careful whisper that I had only filled the machien with water. My sleepy eyes were fxied on the crack where the saved canister stood open! By what miracle had the watcher been fooled like tihs? I was now sure that a supernatural force protected my secret. Made made bold by this lucky event, I started to act with complete openness again when uisng the machine. I was confident no one could see my exact measurements. For a week, I fully enjoyed the pelasures of that fragrant stimulation, which I must not describe. Then accident happened. I was left to suffer in this curesd place of weak, watery coffee and sameness.\n###\nOne morning as I emerged from the somnolent chamber and grasped the handle of the carafe with none too steady hand, I beheld upon the adjacent counter the dreaded form of a witness. Surely the ritual was imperiled; for my method was discovered, and the objective of my matutinal preparations revealed. The figure did not accost me, so I hastened to the kettle in an effort to overhear what she might report to my careworn spouse. Were my measured rites with the dark beans about to be proclaimed to the household? Imagine my delighted astonishment on hearing the observer inform my partner in a cautious whisper that I had merely filled the machine with water; my sleep-filmed eyes fixed upon the crevice where the hoarded canister stood unsealed! By what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded? I was now convinced that a preternatural agency protected my secret. Made bold by this heaven-sent circumstance, I began to resume perfect openness in approaching the apparatus; confident that no one could witness my precise measurements. For a week I tasted to the full the joys of that aromatic stimulation which I must not describe, when the mishap occurred, and I was left to endure this accursed abode of weak dilution and monotony."}

It was not very neat. It hung down quietly and with jersk. Its surface moved in a huge, single motion. This matched the crazy rustling of the waiting curtains outisde. Bits of pillow filling and pieces of beddnig were spread around the room. Just inside the closet, an laundry basket lay where it had clearly been thrown. Near the main nightstand, a feather duster had fallen. A bent but unused hnadle later explained why it had not been used. The thing itself, however, pushed out all other pictures at that time. It would be common. Not fully correct to say no human hand could arrange it. But one can rightly say it could not be clearly imagined by anyone. This is for those whose ideas of balance. Order are too tied to the normal home shapes of this house. Of the three known dimensions. It was partly made, without doubt, with vrey square-like corners and a headboard.

It was not quite orderly, but sagged silently and spasmodically while its surface heaved in monstrous unison with the mad rustling of the expectant curtains outside. Bits of pillow-stuffing and fragments of bedding were scattered about the chamber, and just inside the wardrobe an empty laundry hamper lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central nightstand a feather-duster had fallen, a bent but undischarged handle later explaining why it had not been wielded. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human hand could arrange it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of symmetry and order are too closely bound up with the common domestic forms of this household and of the three known dimensions. It was partly made, beyond a doubt, with very square-like corners and headboard, and the lumpish, pillowless crest had the stamp of haste upon it. But the center and lower parts of the construction were teratologically fabulous, so that only generous tucking could ever have enabled it to rest in daylight unchallenged or uneradicated."}

Partly he feaerd the police. But sometimes his fear was deeper and less clear. It touched on certain things that cannot be described. He had put a sick life into these things. He had not seen that life leave them. He usually ended his experiments with a gun. But a few times he was not fast enough. There was the first specimen. Later, people saw marks of clawing on its robbed grave. There was also the body of the Arkham professor. It had done cannibal acts before it was caught. It was put unnamed into a madhouse cell at Sefton. There it beat the walls for sixteen years. Most other results that might still exist were harder to talk about. In later years, West's scientific passion had become an unhealthy and strange obsession. He had used his main skill to bring life not to whole human bodies. To separate body parts. Or parts joined to organic matter that was not human. It had become extremely disgusting by the time he vanished. Many experiments could not even be suggested in writing. The Great War made this side of West stronger. Both of them served as surgeons through this service.\n###\nWest, in reality, was more afraid than I; for his abominable pursuits entailed a life of furtiveness and dread of every shadow. Partly it was the police he feared; but sometimes his nervousness was deeper and more nebulous, touching on certain indescribable things into which he had injected a morbid life, and from which he had not seen that life depart. He usually finished his experiments with a revolver, but a few times he had not been quick enough. There was that first specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later seen. There was also that Arkham professor\u2019s body which had done cannibal things before it had been captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at Sefton, where it beat the walls for sixteen years. Most of the other possibly surviving results were things less easy to speak of\u2014for in later years West\u2019s scientific zeal had degenerated to an unhealthy and fantastic mania, and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising not entire human bodies but isolated parts of bodies, or parts joined to organic matter other than human. It had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he disappeared; many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print. The Great War, through which both of us served as surgeons, had intensified this side of West."}

They went to see Charles at the hospital. They carefully asked him about Dr. Allen, the Prague visit, and what he learned about Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem.

He said any contact the bearded man has in Prague would likely have the same gift. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett were upset to realize they were the ones being questioned.

Our camera recorded everything. I am sorry that such good film will never reach Berlin. After that, we used our guns to sink the lifeboats. Then we went underwater. We came back to the surface around sunset. A sailor 's [THING] was found on the deck. His hands held the railing in a strange way. The young [THING] was dark and very good - looking. He was probably an Italian or Greek. He was certainly from the Victory 's crew. He had clearly tried to hide on the ship that had to destroy his own ship. He was another victim of the unfair war of attack. The English pig - dogs are waging this war on the Fatherland. Our men looked through his pockets for keepsakes. They fuond a very strange piece of ivory in his coat pocket. It was carved to look like a young [THING] 's [THING] with a laurel crown. My fellow officer, Lieut. Klenze, thought the object was very old and valuable as art. So he took it form the men for himself. How a regular sailor got it, neither he nor I could guess. As we threw the dead [THING] overboard, two things happened. They upset the crew a lot. The [THING] 's eyes had been shut. Dragging his [THING] to the rail made them open. Many men had a strange false idea. They thought the eyes stared steadily and mockingly at Schmidt and Zimmer. They were leaning over the [THING]. The Boatswain M\u00fcller was an older [THING]. He should have known better, but he was a superstitious Alsatian swine. This idea made him so agitated that he watched the [THING] in the [THING]. He swore that after it sank a bit, it pulled its limbs into a swimming pose. Then it swam away fast to the south under the waves. Klenze and I did not like this show of peasant foolishness. We strongly scolded the men, especially M\u00fcller. The next day, a very difficult situation arose. Some of the crew became sick. They were clearly suffering from the stress of our long trip. They had bad dreams. Several seemed very confused and slow. After I made sure they were not pretending to be weak, I let them skip their work. The [THING] was quite choppy. So we went down to a depth where the waves were less of a problem.\n###\nThe ship sank quite picturesquely, bow first, the stern rising high out of the water whilst the hull shot down perpendicularly to the bottom of the sea. Our camera missed nothing, and I regret that so fine a reel of film should never reach Berlin. After that we sank the lifeboats with our guns and submerged. When we rose to the surface about sunset a seaman\u2019s body was found on the deck, hands gripping the railing in curious fashion. The poor fellow was young, rather dark, and very handsome; probably an Italian or Greek, and undoubtedly of the Victory\u2019s crew. He had evidently sought refuge on the very ship which had been forced to destroy his own\u2014one more victim of the unjust war of aggression which the English pig-dogs are waging upon the Fatherland. Our men searched him for souvenirs, and found in his coat pocket a very odd bit of ivory carved to represent a youth\u2019s head crowned with laurel. My fellow-officer, Lieut. Klenze, believed that the thing was of great age and artistic value, so took it from the men for himself. How it had ever come into the possession of a common sailor, neither he nor I could imagine. As the dead man was thrown overboard there occurred two incidents which created much disturbance amongst the crew. The fellow\u2019s eyes had been closed; but in the dragging of his body to the rail they were jarred open, and many seemed to entertain a queer delusion that they gazed steadily and mockingly at Schmidt and Zimmer, who were bent over the corpse. The Boatswain M\u00fcller, an elderly man who would have known better had he not been a superstitious Alsatian swine, became so excited by this impression that he watched the body in the water; and swore that after it sank a little it drew its limbs into a swimming position and sped away to the south under the waves. Klenze and I did not like these displays of peasant ignorance, and severely reprimanded the men, particularly M\u00fcller. The next day a very troublesome situation was created by the indisposition of some of the crew. They were evidently suffering from the nervous strain of our long voyage, and had had bad dreams. Several seemed quite dazed and stupid; and after satisfying myself that they were not feigning their weakness, I excused them from their duties. The sea was rather rough, so we descended to a depth where the waves were less troublesome."}

The tax forms for the year were not neat in the light. They were messy and very bad. The office workers were pale from work and slow with numbers. They were not like the clear-thinking men from stories. But the government had sent him letters. They demanded his reports. So the accountant worked on. The clerk worked with him. The clerk put up with the office rules. He kept receitps and papers in his plain record book. Often in the evening, the accountant worked on the books. But he was still the same as before. He only felt the fear of the check-up. He remembered the perfect books from theory and the clear balance. He worked in the bright light halls of the Director. He worked at a metal desk on a linoleum floor. As he worked, he thought of ghosts. The floor seemed to show old, perfect, and half-forgotten numbers. It did not show the coffee-tsained workers who asked him questiosn. The Manager told him to put away his old briefcase. They gave him calculators and silver-colored software. They gave him red ink stamps and colored plastic binders. They put him in an office with wood panels and carpet. He sat before a smooth plastic computer with monitors and steel printers that showed data. So the accountant lived in the office, the place of record books and computing.\n###\nWhen dawn came the accountant looked about with dismay, for the forms of the fiscal year were not orderly in the light, but chaotic and abysmal. And the men of the office were pallid with labour and dull with figures, and unlike the lucid men of legend. But because the authorities had sent him notices and demanded his declarations the accountant toiled on, and with him the clerk, who tolerated the rituals of the bureau and kept in his drab ledger receipts and statements. Often at evening the accountant laboured over the ledgers, but he was always as before, burdened only with the dread of the audit and remembering the pristine ledgers of theory and the crystalline balance. In the fluorescent halls of the Director did he labour, upon a steel desk raised over a floor that was linoleum, and as he laboured he brought phantoms to his mind till the floor seemed to reflect ancient, perfect, and half-forgotten sums instead of the coffee-stained workers who beset him with queries. And the Manager bade him put away his worn briefcase, and supplied him with calculators and software-of-silver, with stamps of vermilion ink and binders of tinted polymer, and installed him in a panelled and carpeted office before a terminal of smooth moulded plastic with monitors and printers of data-embroidered steel. Thus dwelt the accountant in the bureau, the domain of ledgers and computing."}

He found to his alarm that the structure had not kept its expected layout of empty spots. The support columns were there. But the concrete maze seemed to have lost some of its right-angled stiffness. That morning it had done much seemingly odd moving and sinking, one cleaner said. It replied to some unknown pressure with statements like \"I am quite strained. Must settle a. \", \"I can't accommodate anyone for some time, you'll have to go around me\", \"Please delay car entry until we can arrange some sort of agreement\". \"I am very sorry. I must stop completely from everything. I'll receive you later\". Then, apparently gaining boldness from sinking, it had slid into a lopsided shape. Quietly that no one saw it bend. No one knew it had changed until it became steady aorund one o'clock. It returned to its form without a shake. It had squeezed its lower floors. A bit of its normal shape must have returned there. It was heard to let out a very stressed creak when accepting weight. This faded into a kind of choked groan. When the engineer went to ask what the problem was, he saw at the entrance a great display of steadiness. He was silently pushed back by a look that disturbed him for no clear reaso.n Then it had clearly moved its shadows around. A great noise of clattering and thumping and grinding followed. After that, it took back its proper size and stayed still. The architect asked if any irregularity had been noted. He was told there was none. The cleaner seemed oddly bothered by something in the building's angles and feeling. He asked with concern if there was much chance for fixing its messed-up shape.\n###\nPromptly at four the architect presented himself at the municipal structure, but found to his consternation that the edifice had not adhered to its expected configuration of vacant spaces. The stanchions were there, but said that the concrete labyrinth seemed to have lost part of its orthogonal rigidity. It had that morning done much apparently aberrant shifting and settling, one of the custodians said, replying to some unknown pressure with manifestations such as \u201cI am very strained and must settle a while\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t accommodate anyone for some time, you\u2019ll have to circumvent me\u201d, \u201cPlease postpone vehicular ingress till we can arrange some sort of compromise\u201d, or \u201cI am very sorry, but I must assume a complete stasis from everything; I\u2019ll receive you later\u201d. Then, apparently gaining defiance through subsidence, it had slipped into asymmetry so quietly that no one had seen it warp or knew that it had altered until it stabilized about one o\u2019clock and resumed its form without a tremor. It had compressed its lower levels, where a bit of its regularity must have surged back; for it was heard to emit a highly strained creaking upon accepting weight, afterward trailing off into a kind of suffocated groan. When, however, the engineer had gone to inquire what the trouble was, he had perceived at the threshold a great show of stability, and had been silently repelled by an aspect that disquieted him unaccountably. Then it had evidently done some rearranging of its shadows, for a great clattering and thumping and grating ensued; after which it had reasserted its dimensions and remained at rest. The architect inquired whether or not any deviation had been recorded, but was told that there was none. The custodian seemed queerly disturbed about something in the structure\u2019s angles and atmosphere, and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a correction of its disordered geometry."}

Its high, hateful laugh stuck more and more in Gilman 's [THING]. In the morning, he could remember how it had remarked the words \" Azathoth \" and \" Nyarlathotep \". In the deeper dreams, everything was also more clear. Gilman felt that the dark pits around him belonged to the fourth dimension. The living things whose movements seemed least random were likely images of life from our own world. This included [THING]. He did not dare to think what the others were in their own dimension. Two of the less randomly moving things noticed him. One was a rather large group of shiny, oval bubbles. The other was a much smaller shape with many sides and unknown colors. Its surface angles changed quickly. They seemed to follow him or float ahead as he moved. He moved among huge prisms, mazes, clusters of cubes and planes, and strange buildings. All the while, the unclear screaming and roaring grew louder and louder. It was as if it was nearing some terrible peak of unbearable force. During the night of Aprli 19 - 20, a new thing happened. Gilman was moving half against his will in the dark pits. The bubble mass and the small many - sided shape floated ahead. Then he noticed the unusually regular angles made by the edges of some huge nearby prism clusters. A second later, he was out of the pit. He stood shaking on a rocky hillside. It was washed in strong, spreading green light. He was barefoot and in his night clothes. When he tried to walk, he found he could hardly lift his feet. A swirling mist hid everything except the nearby sloping ground. He feared the sounds that might come from that mist. Then he saw two shapes struggling to crawl toward him. They were the old [THING] and the small furry thing. The old [THING] pushed up to her knees. She managed to cross her arms in a strange way. Meanwhil,e Brown Jenkin pointed in a certain direction. It used a horribly human - like front paw that it raised with clear difficulty. Moved by an impulse he did not start, Gilman pulled himself forward. His path was set by the angle of the old [THING] 's arms. The direction of the small monster 's paw. Before he had shuffled three steps, he was bakc in the dark pits. Geometrical shapes boiled around him. He fell, dizzy and endlessly. Finally, he woke in his bed. The bed was in the crazily angled attic of the strange old [THING].\n###\nIts shrill loathsome tittering stuck more and more in Gilman\u2019s head, and he could remember in the morning how it had pronounced the words \u201cAzathoth\u201d and \u201cNyarlathotep\u201d. In the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct, and Gilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension. Those organic entities whose motions seemed least flagrantly irrelevant and unmotivated were probably projections of life-forms from our own planet, including human beings. What the others were in their own dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think. Two of the less irrelevantly moving things\u2014a rather large congeries of iridescent, prolately spheroidal bubbles and a very much smaller polyhedron of unknown colours and rapidly shifting surface angles\u2014seemed to take notice of him and follow him about or float ahead as he changed position among the titan prisms, labyrinths, cube-and-plane clusters, and quasi-buildings; and all the while the vague shrieking and roaring waxed louder and louder, as if approaching some monstrous climax of utterly unendurable intensity. During the night of April 19\u201320 the new development occurred. Gilman was half-involuntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the bubble-mass and the small polyhedron floating ahead, when he noticed the peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic neighbouring prism-clusters. In another second he was out of the abyss and standing tremulously on a rocky hillside bathed in intense, diffused green light. He was barefooted and in his night-clothes, and when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet. A swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight, and he shrank from the thought of the sounds that might surge out of that vapour. Then he saw the two shapes laboriously crawling toward him\u2014the old woman and the little furry thing. The crone strained up to her knees and managed to cross her arms in a singular fashion, while Brown Jenkin pointed in a certain direction with a horribly anthropoid fore paw which it raised with evident difficulty. Spurred by an impulse he did not originate, Gilman dragged himself forward along a course determined by the angle of the old woman\u2019s arms and the direction of the small monstrosity\u2019s paw, and before he had shuffled three steps he was back in the twilight abysses. Geometrical shapes seethed around him, and he fell dizzily and interminably. At last he woke in his bed in the crazily angled garret of the eldritch old house."}

It was in complete darkness. It was nearly impossible because the steps were monstrously big. They were made for gugs. So they were almost a yard high. Carter could not make a good guess of their number. He became very tired very soon. The never - tiring and flexible ghouls had to help him. During the whole endless climb, there was a hidden danger. The danger was of being found and chased. No gug dares lift the [THING] [THING] to the [THING]. This is because of the Great Ones ' curse. But there are no such rules for the tower and the steps. Escaped ghasts are often chased all the way to the top. The ears of gugs are very sharp. The bare feet and hands of the climbers could be heard easily. This would happen when the [THING] woke up. It would take only a little time for the striding giants. They are used to hunting ghasts in the vaults of Zin. They are used to seeing without light. They would catch their smaller, slower prey on those Cyclopean setps. It was very discouraging to think about. The silent chasing gugs would not be heard at all. They would appear very suddenly and shockingly in the dark. They would appear right upon the climbers. Nor the traditional fear gugs have for ghouls could be trusted. This was especially true in that strange palce. The advantages were so strongly with the gugs. There was also some danger from the sneaky, poisonous ghasts. They often hopped up into the tower. They did this during the sleep hour of the gugs. If the gugs slept long. The ghasts came back soon from their job in the cave, the smell of the climbers might be found easily. Those disgusting and unfriendly things might find it. In that case, it would almost be better to be eaten by a ggu. Then, after ages of climbing, a cough came from the darkness above. Things took a very serious and surprising turn. It was clear that a ghats, or maybe more, had wandered into that tower. This happened before Carter and his guides cam.e It was also clear that this danger was very near. After a second without breathing, the lead ghoul pushed Carter to the [THING]. He placed his two relatives in the best positions. He raised the old slate tombstone. It was ready for a powerful hit. This would happen whenever the enemy came into view. Ghouls can see in the dark. The group was not in as bad a situation as Carter would have been alone.\n###\nThere now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness; made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps, which were fashioned for gugs, and were therefore nearly a yard high. Of their number Carter could form no just estimate, for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him. All through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the Great Ones\u2019 curse, there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps, and escaped ghasts are often chased even to the very top. So sharp are the ears of gugs, that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke; and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants, accustomed from their ghast-hunts in the vaults of Zin to seeing without light, to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those Cyclopean steps. It was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all, but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers. Nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs. There was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts, which frequently hopped up into the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs. If the gugs slept long, and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern, the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and ill-disposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gug. Then, after aeons of climbing, there came a cough from the darkness above; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn. It was clear that a ghast, or perhaps even more, had strayed into that tower before the coming of Carter and his guides; and it was equally clear that this peril was very close. After a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed Carter to the wall and arranged his two kinsfolk in the best possible way, with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight. Ghouls can see in the dark, so the party was not as badly off as Carter would have been alone."}

Nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue, but the little that was achieved left us all awed and bewildered. Existing biology would have to be wholly revised, for this thing was no product of any cell-growth science knows about. There had been scarcely any mineral replacement, and despite an age of perhaps forty million years the internal organs were wholly intact. The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing\u2019s form of organisation; and pertained to some palaeogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation. At first all that Lake found was dry, but as the heated tent produced its thawing effect, organic moisture of pungent and offensive odour was encountered toward the thing\u2019s uninjured side. It was not blood, but a thick, dark-green fluid apparently answering the same purpose. By the time Lake reached this stage all 37 dogs had been brought to the still uncompleted corral near the camp; and even at that distance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid, diffusive smell. Far from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional dissection merely deepened its mystery. All guesses about its external members had been correct, and on the evidence of these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal; but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that Lake was left hopelessly at sea. It had digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste matter through the reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one would say that its respiratory apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon dioxide; and there were odd evidences of air-storage chambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathing-systems\u2014gills and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian and probably adapted to long airless hibernation-periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present in connexion with the main respiratory system, but they presented anomalies beyond immediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable-utterance, seemed barely conceivable; but musical piping notes covering a wide range were highly probable. The muscular system was almost preternaturally developed. The nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave Lake aghast. Though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects, the thing had a set of ganglial centres and connectives arguing the very extremes of specialised development."}

The thing was quite sudden, though later I realised that certain brief, glimmering visions of several hours previous\u2014chaotic visions which disturbed me greatly because they were so unprecedented\u2014must have formed premonitory symptoms. My head was aching, and I had a singular feeling\u2014altogether new to me\u2014that someone else was trying to get possession of my thoughts. The collapse occurred about 10:20 a.m., while I was conducting a class in Political Economy VI\u2014history and present tendencies of economics\u2014for juniors and a few sophomores. I began to see strange shapes before my eyes, and to feel that I was in a grotesque room other than the classroom.

My eyes gazed strangely at the persons around me, and the flexions of my facial muscles were altogether unfamiliar. Even my speech seemed awkward and foreign. I used my vocal organs clumsily and gropingly, and my diction had a curiously stilted quality, as if I had laboriously learned the English language from books. The pronunciation was barbarously alien, whilst the idiom seemed to include both scraps of curious archaism and expressions of a wholly incomprehensible cast. Of the latter one in particular was very potently\u2014even terrifiedly\u2014recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward. For at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currency\u2014first in England and then in the United States\u2014and though of much complexity and indisputable newness, it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham patient of 1908."}

In the wet, dim light, we climbed the old, worn stone stairs. We climbed until the stairs ended. Then we held on dangerously to small places for our feet that led up. Ghastly and terrible was that dead, round rock structure with no stairs. It was black, broken, empty, and scary with bats that flew without sound. But eevn more scary and terrible was how slow we moved. We climbed, but the darkness above did not get lighter. A new cold feeling, like from old, haunted decay, hit us. We shook as we wondered why we did not reach the light. We would have looked down if we were brave enough. We thought that night had suddenly come. We flet with one free hand for a window opening, but found nothing. We wanetd to look out and up to guess how high we had climbed.\n###\nIn the dank twilight I climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till I reached the level where they ceased, and thereafter clung perilously to small footholds leading upward.

But more ghastly and terrible still was the slowness of my progress; for climb as I might, the darkness overhead grew no thinner, and a new chill as of haunted and venerable mould assailed me. I shivered as I wondered why I did not reach the light, and would have looked down had I dared. I fancied that night had come suddenly upon me, and vainly groped with one free hand for a window embrasure, that I might peer out and above, and try to judge the height I had attained."}

Warning me that many of the ceiling lights were out, the electrician drew a rough. Careful picture of the room's main wires for me. After a short study, I felt sure it would be very uesful. I put it in my pocket with much thanks. Disliking the dimness of the one lamp I had checked, I got a good number of ceramic holders. Tungsten wires to use as spares later. My plan, I decided, would be to go up the main ladder. I would look at any guides I might find. I would finish the eight o'clock job for light.

I had looked for wonder and inspiration in the mazes of streets. They twist from forgotten courts. Waterfronts to courts. Waterfronts forgotten. And in the towers and points that rise under fading moons. I found a sense of horror and pressure. It threatened to control, paralyze, and destroy me. The disappointment had been. Coming for the time upon the town, I had seen it in the sunset from a bridge. It was above its waters. Its peaks and pyramids rose flower - and from pools of mist. They played with the burning gold clouds and the stars of evening. it had lighted up window by window above the shining tides. Lanterns nodded and moved. horns cried out harmonies.

My coming to New York had been a mistake; for whereas I had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares and waterfronts to courts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten, and in the Cyclopean modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly Babylonian under waning moons, I had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master, paralyse, and annihilate me. The disillusion had been gradual. Coming for the first time upon the town, I had seen it in the sunset from a bridge, majestic above its waters, its incredible peaks and pyramids rising flower-like and delicate from pools of violet mist to play with the flaming golden clouds and the first stars of evening. Then it had lighted up window by window above the shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and glided and deep horns bayed weird harmonies, and itself become a starry firmament of dream, redolent of faery music, and one with the marvels of Carcassonne and Samarcand and El Dorado and all glorious and half-fabulous cities. Shortly afterward I was taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancy\u2014narrow, curving alleys and passages where rows of red Georgian brick blinked with small-paned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and panelled coaches\u2014and in the first flush of realisation of these long-wished things I thought I had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me in time a poet.

A [THING] who knows what I know about the horrors of Tempest Mountain. Still goes alone to find the fear hiding there can not have a normal mind. The destruction of at least two forms of the fear offered only a small promise of mental. Physical safety in this Acheron of many kinds of evil. Yet I kept searching with even more eagerness as events and discoveries grew more horrible. Two days after my terrifying crawl through that tomb of the eyes. Claw, I learned something had hung threateningly twenty miles away at the same time the eyes were staring at me. I felt almost physical convulsions of fear. That fear was. Miexd with wonder. Strange attraction that it was almost a pleasant feeling. Sometimes, in the grip of a nightmare where unseen forces spin one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning pit of Nis, it is a relief. Even a joy to scream wildly. Throw oneself willingly along with the hideous whirlwind of dream - doom into whatever bottomless hole may open. And so it was with the waking nightmare of Tempest Mountain. Finding thta two monsters had haunted the place gave me in the end a mad desire to dive into the very [THING] of the cursed area. I wanted to dig out the daeth that grinnde from every inch of the poisonous soil with my bare hands. As soon as I could, I went to the grave of Jan Martense. Dug without success where I had dug before. A large cave - in had removed all signs of the underground passage. The [THING] had washed. Much dirt back into the hole that I could not tell how deep I had dug that other da.y I also made a hard trip to the far - off small [THING] where the death - creature had been burned. I got little reward for my effort. In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several bones. But none seemed to be the monster 's. The settlers said the thing had only one victim. But I thought they were wrong. Besides a complete human skull, there was another bone piece that certainly had been part of a human skull at some time. Though [THING] saw the monster 's quick drop, no one could say exactly what the creature looked like. Those who had seen it briefly called it simply a devil.\n###\nIt had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyes. There can be nothing normal in the mind of one who, knowing what I knew of the horrors of Tempest Mountain, would seek alone for the fear that lurked there. That at least two of the fear\u2019s embodiments were destroyed, formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this Acheron of multiform diabolism; yet I continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous. When, two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes and claw, I learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me, I experienced virtual convulsions of fright. But that fright was so mixed with wonder and alluring grotesqueness, that it was almost a pleasant sensation. Sometimes, in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of Nis, it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of dream-doom into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn. And so it was with the waking nightmare of Tempest Mountain; the discovery that two monsters had haunted the spot gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the very earth of the accursed region, and with bare hands dig out the death that leered from every inch of the poisonous soil. As soon as possible I visited the grave of Jan Martense and dug vainly where I had dug before. Some extensive cave-in had obliterated all trace of the underground passage, while the rain had washed so much earth back into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had dug that other day. I likewise made a difficult trip to the distant hamlet where the death-creature had been burnt, and was little repaid for my trouble. In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several bones, but apparently none of the monster\u2019s. The squatters said the thing had had only one victim; but in this I judged them inaccurate, since besides the complete skull of a human being, there was another bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull at some time.

The inside walls were less thick than the outside walls. But on the lower floors they were kept in very good condition. Labyrinthine complexity, with strangely uneven differences in floor heights, marked the whole plan. We would certainly hvae been lost at the very start without the trail of torn paper we left behind. We chose to explore the more broken upepr parts first. So we climbed up in maez for about 100 feet. We went to where the highest set of rooms opened widely. Brokenly to the polar sky. Ascent was done over the steep, cross-ribbed stone ramps or slopes. These ramps were used everywhere instead of stairs. The rooms we found were of all shapes and sizes one could think of. They ranged from five-pointed satrs to triangles and perfect cubes. It might be safe to say their general average was about 30 by 30 feet in floor area. 20 feet high. But many larger rooms existed. After looking well at the upper areas. The ice level, we went down floor by floor into the buried part. There we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected rooms and halls. These probably led over huge areas outside thsi particular building. The Cyclopean heaviness and giant size of everything aorund us became strangely heavy on our minds. There was something not clearly. Deeply not human in all the shapes, sizes, proportions, decorations. Building details of the wrongly old stonework. We soon understood from what the carvinggs showed that this huge city was many millions of years old.\n###\nThe building which we had entered was one of great size and elaborateness, and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of that nameless geologic past. The inner partitions were less massive than the outer walls, but on the lower levels were excellently preserved. Labyrinthine complexity, involving curiously irregular differences in floor levels, characterised the entire arrangement; and we should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail of torn paper left behind us. We decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all, hence climbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some 100 feet, to where the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to the polar sky. Ascent was effected over the steep, transversely ribbed stone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of stairs. The rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions, ranging from five-pointed stars to triangles and perfect cubes. It might be safe to say that their general average was about 30 \u00d7 30 feet in floor area, and 20 feet in height; though many larger apartments existed. After thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level we descended story by story into the submerged part, where indeed we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and passages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular building. The Cyclopean massiveness and giganticism of everything about us became curiously oppressive; and there was something vaguely but deeply unhuman in all the contours, dimensions, proportions, decorations, and constructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework. We soon realised from what the carvings revealed that this monstrous city was many million years old."}

Digging happened where digging had happened before, but nothing was found. A cave-in was seen. It had destroyed all signs of the underground passage. Rain had washed much dirt back into the hole. It could not be determined how the digging had gone that other day. A trip was also made to the distant village. The death-creature had been burned there. reward for the trouble was found. In the ashes of the important cabin several bones were found. But none seemed to be the monster's bones. The squatters said the thing had only one victim. But they were judged to be wrong. Besides a complete human skull, there was another bone piece. That piece certainly had been part of a human skull once. People saw the monster fall quickly. But no one could say exactly what the creature looked like. Those who saw it briefly just called it a devil. At Examinnig, the tree where it had hidden, no special marks could be seen. An attempt was made to find a path into the black forest. But this time the sight coudl not be borne. The sight was of those sickly tree trunks and the huge snake-like roots. Those roots twisted in an evil way before going into the ground.\n###\nAs soon as possible I visited the grave of Jan Martense and dug vainly where I had dug before. Some extensive cave-in had obliterated all trace of the underground passage, while the rain had washed so much earth back into the excavation that I could not tell how deeply I had dug that other day. I likewise made a difficult trip to the distant hamlet where the death-creature had been burnt, and was little repaid for my trouble. In the ashes of the fateful cabin I found several bones, but apparently none of the monster\u2019s. The squatters said the thing had had only one victim; but in this I judged them inaccurate, since besides the complete skull of a human being, there was another bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull at some time.

Examining the great tree where it had lurked, I could discern no distinctive marks. I tried to find some trail into the black forest, but on this occasion could not stand the sight of those morbidly large boles, or of those vast serpent-like roots that twisted so malevolently before they sank into the earth."}

From this point on, Blake's diary shows a growing feeling of hidden horror. We blame ourselves for not doing something. We think wildly about what would happen if the power went out again. It is confirmed that three times during thunderstorms we called the electric company in a panic. We begged them to take strong steps to prevent a power loss. Sometimes our notes show we are worried that the reporters did not find the metal box, the stone. The strangely damaged old skeleton when they searched the dark tower room. We believe tehse things were taken awya. We can only guess where they went and who or what took them. But our biggest fears are about ourselves. We fear the evil connection we feel exists betwene our minds. The hidden horror in the distant steeple. That monstrous night thing was called out from the deepest black spaces by our reckelss actions. We seem to feel a constant pulling at our will. People who visited thne remember how we would sit lost in thought at our desk. We would stare out the west window at the far-off hill full of spires beyond the city's swirling smoke. Our notes keep talking about certain terrible dreams. They talk about the evil connection getting stronger in our sleep. There is a note about one night. We woke up to find ourselves fully dressed, outside. Automatically walking down College Hill toward the west. Again we talk about the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find us.\n###\nFrom this point onward Blake\u2019s diary shews a mounting tide of insidious horror and nervous apprehension. He upbraids himself for not doing something, and speculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown. It has been verified that on three occasions\u2014during thunderstorms\u2014he telephoned the electric light company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions against a lapse of power be taken. Now and then his entries shew concern over the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone, and the strangely marred old skeleton, when they explored the shadowy tower room. He assumed that these things had been removed\u2014whither, and by whom or what, he could only guess. But his worst fears concerned himself, and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeple\u2014that monstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black spaces. He seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will, and callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and stare out of the west window at that far-off, spire-bristling mound beyond the swirling smoke of the city. His entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible dreams, and of a strengthening of the unholy rapport in his sleep. There is mention of a night when he awaked to find himself fully dressed, outdoors, and headed automatically down College Hill toward the west. Again and again he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him."}

Soon after his daughter was born, Curwen decided to have his portrait painted. He seemed unusually happy about the birth, which was not like his normal cold self. He hired a very talented Scotsman named Cosom Alexander to paint it. Cosmo Alexander lived in Newport at the time. He later became famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The portrait was painted on a wooden panel in the library of the house in Olney Court. Two old diaries mention the portrait. But neither says what finally happened to it. During this time, the unpredictable scholar seemed very distracted. He spent as much time as possible at his farm on Pawtuxet Road. He seemed to be in a state of hidden exciteemnt or waiting. It was as if he expected something amazing or was close to a strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy seemed very important. He took most of his books on that subject from his house to the farm.\n###\nShortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject."}

Tracks of many kinds fill the rough, uneven road. This is despite the area being not often visited. With a weak curiosity, one starts to follow the sahpe of some of the different marks. At the same time, one tries to control the dark thoughts that the place. Its memories bring up. There is something threatening and uneasy in the deathly quiet. There is also something in the soft, faint sound of faraway streams. The close green mountain tops. Dark wooded cliffs that block the narrow view add to this feeling.\n###\nLed by my thoughts, my eyes turned downward to the powdery road surface which had held such hideous testimonies. The last few days had been dry, and tracks of all sorts cluttered the rutted, irregular highway despite the unfrequented nature of the district. With a vague curiosity I began to trace the outline of some of the heterogeneous impressions, trying meanwhile to curb the flights of macabre fancy which the place and its memories suggested. There was something menacing and uncomfortable in the funereal stillness, in the muffled, subtle trickle of distant brooks, and in the crowding green peaks and black-wooded precipices that choked the narrow horizon."}

As I have already admitted, my superior, old Dr. Fenton, denies the reality of everything I have related. He vows that I was broken down with nervous strain, and badly in need of the long vacation on full pay which he so generously gave me. He assures me on his professional honour that Joe Slater was but a low-grade paranoiac, whose fantastic notions must have come from the crude hereditary folk-tales which circulate in even the most decadent of communities.

Lest you think me a biassed witness, another\u2019s pen must add this final testimony, which may perhaps supply the climax you expect. I will quote the following account of the star Nova Persei verbatim from the pages of that eminent astronomical authority, Prof. Garrett P. Serviss: On February 22, 1901, a marvellous new star was discovered by Dr. Anderson, of Edinburgh, not very far from Algol. No star had been visible at that point before. Within twenty-four hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone Capella. In a week or two it had visibly faded, and in the course of a few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye.\u201d In the valley of Nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly, tearing a path for its light with feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a great upas-tree. And within the depths of the valley, where the light reaches not, move forms not meet to be beheld. Rank is the herbage on each slope, where evil vines and creeping plants crawl amidst the stones of ruined palaces, twining tightly about broken columns and strange monoliths, and heaving up marble pavements laid by forgotten hands. And in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards leap little apes, while in and out of deep treasure-vaults writhe poison serpents and scaly things without a name. Vast are the stones which sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss, and mighty were the walls from which they fell. For all time did their builders erect them, and in sooth they yet serve nobly, for beneath them the grey toad makes his habitation. At the very bottom of the valley lies the river Than, whose waters are slimy and filled with weeds."}

For some time I thought visions were, though I had been a dreamer. I told myself of the things must have come from causes to find. Others seemed to show a schoolbook knowledge of plants. things from the world one hundred fifty million years agothe feeling of memory being held, the ideas about time, the sense of a swap with my self from 1908 to 1913., the disgust with my body. As some details began to enter the dreams, their hororr grew a thousand timesand. Any idea of things. The sights and feelings were. What was suggested. Stated by some dreamers tasted of madness. of all, my memory was stirred to wilder dreams. Hints of coming truths. And doctors thought my path, on the whole, was a one. I studied psychology in an way. Under the push, my son Wingate did the \u2014 his studies leading at to his job as a professor. In 1917 and 1918 I took classes at Miskatonic. At the time my look into,, and people - study records became. This meant trips to libraries. It included reading the books of forbidden knowledge in which my self had been.\n###\nFor some time I accepted the visions as natural, even though I had never before been an extravagant dreamer. Many of the vague anomalies, I argued, must have come from trivial sources too numerous to track down; while others seemed to reflect a common text-book knowledge of the plants and other conditions of the primitive world of a hundred and fifty million years ago\u2014the world of the Permian or Triassic age. In the course of some months, however, the element of terror did figure with accumulating force. This was when the dreams began so unfailingly to have the aspect of memories, and when my mind began to link them with my growing abstract disturbances\u2014the feeling of mnemonic restraint, the curious impressions regarding time, the sense of a loathsome exchange with my secondary personality of 1908\u201313, and, considerably later, the inexplicable loathing of my own person. As certain definite details began to enter the dreams, their horror increased a thousandfold\u2014until by October, 1915, I felt I must do something. It was then that I began an intensive study of other cases of amnesia and visions, feeling that I might thereby objectivise my trouble and shake clear of its emotional grip. However, as before mentioned, the result was at first almost exactly opposite. It disturbed me vastly to find that my dreams had been so closely duplicated; especially since some of the accounts were too early to admit of any geological knowledge\u2014and therefore of any idea of primitive landscapes\u2014on the subjects\u2019 part. What is more, many of these accounts supplied very horrible details and explanations in connexion with the visions of great buildings and jungle gardens\u2014and other things. The actual sights and vague impressions were bad enough, but what was hinted or asserted by some of the other dreamers savoured of madness and blasphemy. Worst of all, my own pseudo-memory was aroused to wilder dreams and hints of coming revelations. And yet most doctors deemed my course, on the whole, an advisable one. I studied psychology systematically, and under the prevailing stimulus my son Wingate did the same\u2014his studies leading eventually to his present professorship. In 1917 and 1918 I took special courses at Miskatonic. Meanwhile my examination of medical, historical, and anthropological records became indefatigable; involving travels to distant libraries, and finally including even a reading of the hideous books of forbidden elder lore in which my secondary personality had been so disturbingly interested."}

When the observer reached the area, he saw that the trap-door was open. Ahead the shelves started again. He saw a pile on the floor in front of one shelf. The pile had very dust, showing some boxes had fallen recently. At that moment, a wave of fear grabbed him. He could not tell why. Heaps of fallen boxes were not rare.

It rose to the northeast behind me. The gleams were spaced differently but could only be an answering signal. Controlling my muscles. Knowing again how visible I was, I went back to my faster, pretended suhffling walk. I kept my eyes on that hellish. Threatening reef as long as the opening of South Street let me see the sea. I could not imagine what it all meant. It might involve some strange ritual connected to Devil Reef. Or perhaps a group had landed from a ship on thta sinister rock. I now turned left around the ruined green space. I still looked toward the ocean, which shone in the ghostly summer moonlight. I watched the mysterious flashing of those nameles,s unexplainable lights. Then the most horrible impression of all came to me. This imprsesion destroyed my last bit of self-control. It made me run wildly south past the dark, open doorways. Fish-like staring windows of that deserted nightmare street. When I looked closer, I saw the moonlit waters between the reef. The shore were not empty. They were full of a crowd of shapes swimming toward the town. Even from my far distance. In my brief moment of seeing, I could tell the bobbing heads. Waving arms were alien. Abnormal in a way hard to describe. My frantic running stopped before I went a full block. On my left, I began to hear something like the noise of an organized chase. There were footsteps and throaty sounds. A rattling motor moved south along Federal Street. In a second, all my plnas changed completely. If the south road was blocked ahead, I clearly had to find another way out of Innsmouth. I stopped and moved into a wide doorway. I thought how lucky I was to leave the moonlit open space before these chasers came down the parallel street. A second thought was less comforting. Since the chase was on another street, the gorup was not following me directly. They had not seen me. They were simply following a general plan to block my escape.\n###\nAnd to make matters worse, there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the Gilman House, which loomed up to the northeast behind me, a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering signal. Controlling my muscles, and realising afresh how plainly visible I was, I resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling pace; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous reef as long as the opening of South Street gave me a seaward view. What the whole proceeding meant, I could not imagine; unless it involved some strange rite connected with Devil Reef, or unless some party had landed from a ship on that sinister rock. I now bent to the left around the ruinous green; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight, and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless, unexplainable beacons. It was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon me\u2014the impression which destroyed my last vestige of self-control and set me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street. For at a closer glance I saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty. They were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town; and even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perception I could tell that the bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to be expressed or consciously formulated. My frantic running ceased before I had covered a block, for at my left I began to hear something like the hue and cry of organised pursuit. There were footsteps and guttural sounds, and a rattling motor wheezed south along Federal Street. In a second all my plans were utterly changed\u2014for if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me, I must clearly find another egress from Innsmouth. I paused and drew into a gaping doorway, reflecting how lucky I was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street. A second reflection was less comforting. Since the pursuit was down another street, it was plain that the party was not following me directly. It had not seen me, but was simply obeying a general plan of cutting off my escape."}

Often in the recent notes in the library. They were, mostly, the same. The symbols of \"Dragon's Head\" and \"Dragon's Tail\" headed thme as in Ward's writings. But the spelling was quite different from the modern versions. It was as if Curwen had a different way of writing sonud. Or as if later study had made more powerful and perfect versions of these calls. The doctor tried to match the carved version with the one still stuck in his head. He found it to do. Where the text he had memorized began \"Y'ai 'ng'ngah, Yog-Sothoth\", this carving started as \"Aye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\". To his mind this would badly mess up the syllable breaks of the second word. Ground as the later text was fixed in his mind, the difference troubled him. He found himself saying the first formula out He tried to make the sound he thought fit the letters he saw carved. and threatening in that pit of evil rang his voice. Its tone was tuned to a humming chant. This was either from the spell of the past. From the hellish example of that dull, godless cry from the holes. Its inhuman rhythms rose and fell in the distance through the smell and What was this wind that had sprung up right at the start of the chant? The lamps were sputtering badly. The gloom grew so the letters on the wall almost vanished. There was smoke too. A sharp smell that drowned out stench from the far-away wells. A smell like he had known before, but much stronger and sharper. He turned from the writings to face the room with its things. He saw kylix on the floor, where the crusty powder had been, was giving off a cloud of greenish-black vapor. It was surprisingly and solid. That powderwhat was it doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been sayingDragon's Head, ascending node\u2014Blessed Saviour, could it be. . . .\n###\nThe right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \u201cDragon\u2019s Head\u201d and \u201cDragon\u2019s Tail\u201d heading them as in Ward\u2019s scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began \u201cY\u2019ai \u2019ng\u2019ngah, Yog-Sothoth\u201d, this epigraph started out as \u201cAye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\u201d; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word. Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness. But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That powder\u2014Great God! it had come from the shelf of \u201cMateria\u201d\u2014what was it doing now, and what had started it?

His hearing, which was unnaturally sharp, semeed to try to catch a faint, feared sound beyond the noiess in the old [THING]. Memories of things in the Necronomicon and the Black Book rose in his mind. He found himself moving to unspeakable rhythms. These rhythms are said to belong to the darkest ceremonies of the Sabba.t They are said to have a source outside the time and space we know. Then he realized what he was listening for. It was the hellish singing of the [THING] in the distant black valley. How did he know so much about what they were waiting for? How did he know the time when Nahab. Her helper were supposed to carry the full bowl? This would come after the black rooster and the black goat. He saw that Elwood had fallen asleep. He tried to call out and wake him. Something, however, closed his throat. He was not in control of himself. Had he signed the black [THING] \u2019s [THING] after all? Then his feverish, abnormal hearing caught the distant notes carried by the [THING]. They came over Over miles of hill. He still recognized them. The fires must be lit. The dancers must be starting. How could he stop himself from going? What was it that had trapped him? Mathematicsthe houseBrown Jenkin... And now he saw there was a new rat - hole in the [THING] near his bed. Along with the distant chantnig and the closer praying of Joe Mazurewicz, another sound came. It was a quiet, determined scratching in the walls. He hoped the electric lights would not go out. Then he saw the small [THING] with fangs and a beard in the rat - hole. It was the cursed little [THING]. He finally realized it looked so shockingly and mockingly like old Keziah \u2019s [THING]. He heard the faint fumbling at the [THING]. The screaming, dark depths flashed before him. He felt himself helpless in the shapeless hold of the shiny, colorful group of bubbles. The small, changing polyhedron raced. Trhoughout the turning emptiness, the unclear pattern of sounds grew stronger and faster. It seemed to warn of some unspeakable and unbearable peak. He seemed to know what was coming. It was the monstrous burst of Walpurgis - rhythm. Its cosmic sound would contain all the original, final space - time chaos. This chaos lies behind all the gathered spheres of matter. Sometimes it breaks out in measured echoes. These echoes faintly reach every layer of existence. They give a horrible meaning throughout the worlds to certain feared periods.\n###\nGilman listened as he nodded, his preternaturally sharpened hearing seeming to strain for some subtle, dreaded murmur beyond the noises in the ancient house. Unwholesome recollections of things in the Necronomicon and the Black Book welled up, and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the Sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehend. Presently he realised what he was listening for\u2014the hellish chant of the celebrants in the distant black valley. How did he know so much about what they expected? How did he know the time when Nahab and her acolyte were due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow the black cock and the black goat? He saw that Elwood had dropped asleep, and tried to call out and waken him. Something, however, closed his throat. He was not his own master. Had he signed the black man\u2019s book after all? Then his fevered, abnormal hearing caught the distant, windborne notes. Over miles of hill and field and alley they came, but he recognised them none the less. The fires must be lit, and the dancers must be starting in. How could he keep himself from going? What was it that had enmeshed him? Mathematics\u2014folklore\u2014the house\u2014old Keziah\u2014Brown Jenkin . . . and now he saw that there was a fresh rat-hole in the wall near his couch. Above the distant chanting and the nearer praying of Joe Mazurewicz came another sound\u2014a stealthy, determined scratching in the partitions. He hoped the electric lights would not go out. Then he saw the fanged, bearded little face in the rat-hole\u2014the accursed little face which he at last realised bore such a shocking, mocking resemblance to old Keziah\u2019s\u2014and heard the faint fumbling at the door. The screaming twilight abysses flashed before him, and he felt himself helpless in the formless grasp of the iridescent bubble-congeries. Ahead raced the small, kaleidoscopic polyhedron, and all through the churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the vague tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and unendurable climax. He seemed to know what was coming\u2014the monstrous burst of Walpurgis-rhythm in whose cosmic timbre would be concentrated all the primal, ultimate space-time seethings which lie behind the massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periods."}

The change in Crawford Tillinghast was horrible beyond understanding. One had not seen him since that day two and a half months before. On that day, he told his friend the goal of his physical and mental research. He anwsered the friend's respectful. Almost scared objections by chasing him from the lab. House in a fit of extreme anger. It was known he now stayed mostly in the attic lab with that cursed electrical machine. He ate little and kept even the servants out. It had not been thought a short ten weeks could change. Ruin a human. It is not nice to see a heavy man suddenly become thi.n It is worse when the loose skin turns yellow or gray. The eyes sink in, have circles, and glow strangely. The forehead has veins and wrinkles. The hands shake and twitch. If you add to this a disgusting messiness, widl messy clothes, thick dark hair with white roots. A full white beard on a once clean-shaven face, the total effect is very shocking. This was how Crawford Tillinghast looked on the night his confused message brought his friend to his door after weeks away. This was ghost that shook as it let the visitor in. It held a candle. Looked secretly ovre its shoulder as if afraid of unseen things in the old, lonely house away from Benevolent Street.\n###\nHorrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend, Crawford Tillinghast. I had not seen him since that day, two months and a half before, when he had told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading; when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage. I had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine, eating little and excluding even the servants, but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature. It is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or greyed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily glowing, the forehead veined and corrugated, and the hands tremulous and twitching. And if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness; a wild disorder of dress, a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots, and an unchecked growth of pure white beard on a face once clean-shaven, the cumulative effect is quite shocking. But such was the aspect of Crawford Tillinghast on the night his half-coherent message brought me to his door after my weeks of exile; such the spectre that trembled as it admitted me, candle in hand, and glanced furtively over its shoulder as if fearful of unseen things in the ancient, lonely house set back from Benevolent Street."}

Friday morning, Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by car for Dunwich. They arrived at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was nice. Even in bright sunlight, a kind of quiet fear. Warning seemed to hang over the strangely rounded hills. Deep, dark ravines of the affected area. Sometimes on a mountain top, a thin circle of stones could be seen against the sky. From the quiet fear at Osborn\u2019s store, the observer knew something terrible had happened. He soon learned about the complete destruction of the Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they drove around Dunwich. They asked the local people about all that had happened. They saw for themselves with growing horror the sad Frye ruins. They had remaining signs of a sticky, tar-like substance. They saw the offensive tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle. The large areas of damaged plants in various places. The path up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage to have almost disaster-level importance. He looked for a long time at the evil, altar-like stone on the top.\n###\nFriday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich, arriving at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant, but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain-top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the air of hushed fright at Osborn\u2019s store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich; questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar-like stone on the summit."}

He had to admit he was looking for a kind of formul.a Spell containing the name Yog - Sothoth. It confused him to find differences, repeats, and parts. These made deciding. As he copied the formula he picked, Dr. Armitage looked over his shoulder without meaning to. The pages were. The - hand one, in the version, held threats to the peace. Sanity of the world. \" Nor is it to be thought, \" the text said as Armitage translated it in his mind, \" that man is either the. The of earth 's masters. Or that the mass of life and substance walks. The Old Ones were, the Ancient Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, They walk and. They are without dimensions and by us. Yog - Sothoth knows the gate. Yog - Sothoth is the gate. Yog - Sothoth is the key and guard of the gate.,,, all are one in Yog - Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through. He knows where They shall break through. He knows where They haev walked earth 's fields. He knows where They walk them. He knows why no one can see Them as They walk. By Their smell can men know Them is. But of Their appearance can no man know. Except in the features of those They have fathered on mankind. And of those there are kinds. They differ in likeness from man 's image to that shaep without sight. Substance which is Them. They walk and in places. Places where the Words have been spoken and Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind chatters with Their voices. The earth mumbles with Their awareness. They bend the forest and crush the city. Yet neither forest nor city may see the hand that strikes. Kadath in the waste has known Them. And what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the islands of Ocean hold stones. Their seal is carved on those stones. Who has seen the city. The tower wrapped with seaweed. Great Cthulhu is Their cousin. Yet he can see Them. I\u00e4! Shub - Niggurath! As a foulness shall you know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet you see Them not. And Their home is one with your guarded doorstep.\n###\nHe was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy. As he copied the formula he finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world. \u201cNor is it to be thought,\u201d ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it, \u201cthat man is either the oldest or the last of earth\u2019s masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, They walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth\u2019s fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man\u2019s truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. I\u00e4! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold."}

The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings. Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwen\u2019s features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel. Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate."}

A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky. Lightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became unmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs. The change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky\u2019s blue, pressed down upon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat brighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had shewed a certain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height. No one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of Dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surcharged. Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not from any human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came from the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the peak. It is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet one must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of half-articulate words. They were loud\u2014loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed\u2014yet did they come from no visible being. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain\u2019s base huddled still closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow. The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at the telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination."}

Everything below was still black. The pale stars in the sky seemed to have meaning. Direction they never had before. The constellations were the same shapes. But now they showed a meaning that was not clear before. Everything pointed to the north. Every part of the bright sky became part of a large design. This design seemed to pull the eye and then the whole writer north. It pulled them toward a secret and terrible meeting point. This point was beyond the frozen empty land that went on forever ahead. The writer looked to the east. The great line of high barrier mountains had stood along all of Inganok. Against the stars, the writer saw a rouhg black shape. This showed the mountains were still there. The shape was more broken now. It had wide gaps and extremely irregular high points. The writer looked closely at the strange outline's turns and angles. This outline seemed to share with the stars a slihgt pull to the north.\n###\nThen suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above. All below was still black, but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere. It was not that the figures of the constellations were different, but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain. Everything focussed toward the north; every curve and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead. Carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of Inganok, and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence. It was more broken now, with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles; and Carter studied closely the suggestive turns and inclinations of that grotesque outline, which seemed to share with the stars some subtle northward urge."}

He came to us in our study. This is a tall west room on the second floor. It has arched ceilings and balck oak wall panels. It has a triple Gothic window. The window looks out on a limestone cliff and an empty valley. Even as he spoke, we saw the black form of Nigger-Man. He was moving along the west wall. He was scratching at the new panels covering the old stone. We told the man there must be a strange smell. Something coming from the old stone. Humans cannot sense it. But it affects cats' sensitive senses, even through the new wood. We truly believed this. When the man suggested mice. Rats, we said there had been no rats there for three hundred years. Even the field mice from the area are hardly ever found in these high walls. They are not known to go there. That afternoon we visited Cpat. Norrys.

He came to me in my study, a lofty west room on the second story, with groined arches, black oak panelling, and a triple Gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley; and even as he spoke I saw the jetty form of Nigger-Man creeping along the west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient stone. I told the man that there must be some singular odour or emanation from the old stonework, imperceptible to human senses, but affecting the delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork. This I truly believed, and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats, I mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years, and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be found in these high walls, where they had never been known to stray. That afternoon I called on Capt. Norrys, and he assured me that it would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden and unprecedented fashion."}

They aslo drove very large, boat-shaped cars quickly on the wide rodas. It was noted that fear of them stopped. They seemed to fit perfectly into thier surroundings. Individual differences between them became clear. A few seemed to be under some form of control. These few did not look different physically. But they had different movements and behaviors. This set them apart from most of the others and also from each other. It is observed that they wrote a lot using many different symbols. They never used the common curved symbols of the majority. It is suggested that a few used our own alphabet. Most of them are seen to have worked much slower than the main group of beings.\n###\nAfterward I saw them everywhere; swarming in all the great chambers and corridors, tending monstrous machines in vaulted crypts, and racing along the vast roads in gigantic boat-shaped cars. I ceased to be afraid of them, for they seemed to form supremely natural parts of their environment. Individual differences amongst them began to be manifest, and a few appeared to be under some kind of restraint. These latter, though shewing no physical variation, had a diversity of gestures and habits which marked them off not only from the majority, but very largely from one another. They wrote a great deal in what seemed to my cloudy vision a vast variety of characters\u2014never the typical curvilinear hieroglyphs of the majority. A few, I fancied, used our own familiar alphabet. Most of them worked much more slowly than the general mass of the entities."}

Some of the experiments she proposed were very daring and radical\u2014he did not feel at liberty to describe them\u2014but he had confidence in her powers and intentions. The three servants were very queer\u2014an incredibly aged couple who had been with old Ephraim and referred occasionally to him and to Asenath\u2019s dead mother in a cryptic way, and a swarthy young wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a perpetual odour of fish. For the next two years I saw less and less of Derby. A fortnight would sometimes slip by without the familiar three-and-two strokes at the front door; and when he did call\u2014or when, as happened with increasing infrequency, I called on him\u2014he was very little disposed to converse on vital topics. He had become secretive about those occult studies which he used to describe and discuss so minutely, and preferred not to talk of his wife. She had aged tremendously since her marriage, till now\u2014oddly enough\u2014she seemed the elder of the two. Her face held the most concentratedly determined expression I had ever seen, and her whole aspect seemed to gain a vague, unplaceable repulsiveness. My wife and son noticed it as much as I, and we all ceased gradually to call on her\u2014for which, Edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless moments, she was unmitigatedly grateful. Occasionally the Derbys would go on long trips\u2014ostensibly to Europe, though Edward sometimes hinted at obscurer destinations. It was after the first year that people began talking about the change in Edward Derby. It was very casual talk, for the change was purely psychological; but it brought up some interesting points. Now and then, it seemed, Edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things wholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature. For example\u2014although in the old days he could not drive a car, he was now seen occasionally to dash into or out of the old Crowninshield driveway with Asenath\u2019s powerful Packard, handling it like a master, and meeting traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his accustomed nature. In such cases he seemed always to be just back from some trip or just starting on one\u2014what sort of trip, no one could guess, although he mostly favoured the Innsmouth road. Oddly, the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing."}

Shielding hismelf from realizing why, he gave the detectives an item to show to Pawtuxet shopkeepers who had seen the ominous Dr. Allen. That item was a photo of his unfortunate son. On it, he carefully drew in ink the heavy glasses. Black pointed beard the men brought from Allen's room. For two hours, he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house. A bad smell gathered slowly as the empyt panel in the upstairs library stared. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photo was a very good likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped his suddenly damp forehead with a handkerchief. AllenCurwenhe had been nervous all morning, then there was a change.

Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allen\u2019s room. For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen\u2014Ward\u2014Curwen\u2014it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too \u2018squeamish\u2019, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \u201cCurwen\u201d must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received\u2014he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no\u2014had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study\u2014this very room? What had he found there? Or wait\u2014what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go\u2014was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises? Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises\u2014a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word.

Two of the chosen people she told somewhat doubtful about the possible heavy side of the weekly task. There was not one who did not think some kind of organized. Joint action was necessary. Clearly, the laundry was a vague possible threat to the household's order and its people. It must be removed at any cost. Late on a Sunday evening, a group of determined residents met in basement laundry room. They discussed possible steps. The detergent notes, which she had given to Mr. Henderson, were read carefully. She and young Jenkins were called to give testimony about details. Something something very much like fear seized the whole group before the meeting ended. But through that fear ran a firm resolve. Mr. Henderson's bold and strong statements expressed it best. They would not tell the landlord, because a more than usual approach seemed needed. With hidden piles of uncertain size apparently waiting for them, the laundry was not a job that could safely be put off another day. Nameless results might follow. Even if the sinister piles were dealt with, finishing would only move a dirty burden to another cycle. situation was serious. Women who had ignored the rules of home order for days were not the ones to refuse harder duties when need pushed them. The laundry must be faced in its sorting area by a lrage work party of experienced household members. It must be given one clear chance to be conquered. If it proved a manageable amount, amsuing itself with just colors. Fabrics needing similar temperatures, it would be processed correctly. If something more serious appeared. If the underground horrors of the hamper were indeed rael, it. Everything with it must be cleaned. It could be done in an orderly way.

The laundry, it was clear, formed a vague potential menace to the order of the household and its inhabitants; and must be eliminated at any cost. Late on a Sunday evening a group of determined residents met in the basement laundry-room and debated tentative measures. The detergent notes, which she had given to Mr. Henderson, were carefully read; and she and young Jenkins were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very like dread seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over, though there ran through that dread a grim determination which Mr. Henderson\u2019s bluff and resonant pronouncements best expressed. They would not notify the landlord, because a more than ordinary course seemed necessary. With hidden accumulations of uncertain extent apparently awaiting them, the laundry was not a task that could safely be postponed another day. Nameless consequences might ensue, and even if the sinister piles were addressed, the completion would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another cycle. The circumstances were dire, and women who had flouted the dictates of domestic order for days were not the ones to balk at sterner duties when necessity impelled. The laundry must be confronted in its sorting-area by a large working-party of seasoned household members and given one decisive chance to be subdued. If it proved a manageable quantity, amusing itself with mere colours and fabrics requiring similar temperatures, it would be properly processed. If something graver appeared, and if the subterranean horrors of the hamper indeed turned out to be real, it and all with it must be cleansed. It could be done methodically, and even the visiting aunt and her companion need not be told how it came about."}

Apprehensive of the ending of the lunch hour, the attendants set a somewhat rapid pace; but even so the wait was no brief one, for distances in that line of carts are on a great scale. At last, however, we came to a somewhat open space before a conveyor even vaster than the rest, above whose colossal register was fixed a monstrous digital display in glowing numerals which made one weary without knowing its total. This was the central lane with the sign of express, and those countless plastic items just visible through the glare upon the belt were the beginning of the great transaction leading to fiscal oblivion and the parking lot beyond."}

There was a grayish layer of tiny matter, fine veil of dried debris. It was gathering with sinister patience on the still glass surface. There were a few other small clusters of clearly equal age. Then my attention was caught by the clear process of settling from the still air above. At first I was disgutsed and fascinated. Considering the complete qiuet of the sealed room, I decided right after that the buildup had just started again from some unseen disturbance. I watched with growing fear as the particles fell through the motionless air. The settling was slow, yet it seemed to have a curious quality of conscious purpose. I hated this quality more because the settling was slow. When I had last left the desk, I had turned the monitor off into darkness. Now, after an age of inactive sleep during which the dust may have been seeping into the very seams of the plastic frame, I saw a faint shimmer in the slanted light. I saw the disgusting layer grow thicker once again.\n###\nI had turned to the dormant screen and was examining its spectral accumulation\u2014a greyish pall of particulate matter, a gossamer shroud of desiccated detritus, coalescing with sinister patience upon the inert glass plane, and a few other minute conglomerations of evidently equal antiquity\u2014when my attention was aroused by the unmistakable process of settling from the stagnant air above. At first repulsed and mesmerized, considering the utter stillness of the sealed chamber, I immediately afterward concluded that the accretion had just commenced anew from some unseen disturbance; and observed with mounting dread as the particles descended through the motionless atmosphere. The deposition was gradual, yet seemed to contain a curious quality of sentient purpose; a quality which I abhorred the more because the deposition was gradual. When I had last departed the desk I had powered the monitor into darkness. Now, after an aeon of inert slumber during which the dust may have been infiltrating the very seams of the plastic bezel, I perceived a faint shimmer in the oblique light and saw the loathsome veneer thicken yet again."}

The thing came and without warning. A demon, rat scurrying from pits and, a hell.\n###\nI cannot sleep at night now, and have to take opiates when it thunders. The thing came abruptly and unannounced; a daemon, rat-like scurrying from pits remote and unimaginable, a hellish panting and stifled grunting, and then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous and leprous life\u2014a loathsome night-spawned flood of organic corruption more devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of mortal madness and morbidity. Seething, stewing, surging, bubbling like serpents\u2019 slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole, spreading like a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of egress\u2014streaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests and strew fear, madness, and death. God knows how many there were\u2014there must have been thousands. To see the stream of them in that faint, intermittent lightning was shocking. When they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms, I saw that they were dwarfed, deformed hairy devils or apes\u2014monstrous and diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe. They were so hideously silent; there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers turned with the skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed fashion on a weaker companion. Others snapped up what it left and ate with slavering relish. Then, in spite of my daze of fright and disgust, my morbid curiosity triumphed; and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare, I drew my automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder. Shrieking, slithering, torrential shadows of red viscous madness chasing one another through endless, ensanguined corridors of purple fulgurous sky . . . formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a ghoulish, remembered scene; forests of monstrous overnourished oaks with serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth verminous with millions of cannibal devils; mound-like tentacles groping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion . . . insane lightning over malignant ivied walls and daemon arcades choked with fungous vegetation. . . . Heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men dwell; to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing skies. I had recovered enough in a week to send to Albany for a gang of men to blow up the Martense mansion and the entire top of Tempest Mountain with dynamite, stop up all the discoverable mound-burrows, and destroy certain overnourished trees whose very existence seemed an insult to sanity."}

He had known that the Great Ones themselves are not beyond a mortal\u2019s power to cope with, and had trusted to luck that the Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the crucial moment, as they had so often done before when men sought out earth\u2019s gods in their home or on their mountains. And with his hideous escort he had half hoped to defy even the Other Gods if need were, knowing as he did that ghouls have no masters, and that night-gaunts own not Nyarlathotep but only archaick Nodens for their lord. But now he saw that supernal Kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders and nameless sentinels, and that the Other Gods are of a surety vigilant in guarding the mild, feeble gods of earth. Void as they are of lordship over ghouls and night-gaunts, the mindless, shapeless blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must; so that it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that Randolph Carter came into the Great Ones\u2019 throne-room with his ghouls. Swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars, and dogged by unseen horrors of the northern waste, all that army floated captive and helpless in the lurid light, dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds of fright dissolved."}

I got our degrees at the school of Miskatonic University, we tried to ease our poverty by setitng up as doctors. We took care not to say we chose our home because it was. We did not say it was as to the potter 's field. Reticence like this is without a reason, nor was ours. Our needs resulted from a life - work that was. we were doctors. But beneath the surface were goals of and importance. The core of Herbert West 's existence was a search in. areas of the unknown. He hoped to find the secret of life. Bring the clay of the graveyard to lasting animation. Such a search needs materials, including bodies. To keep supplied with these things, one must live. Not from a place of burial. West and I had met in college. I had been the one to understand his experiments. Over time I had become his assistant. that we were out of college, we had to stay. It was not to find a start for two doctors. But, the influence of the university got us a practice in Bolton. This was a factory town near Arkhma, where the college was located. The Bolton Worsted Mills are the in the Miskatonic Valley. Their workers of languages are as patients with the doctors. We chose our house with the care. We seized a run - down cottage near the end of Pond Street. It was five houses from the neighbor. It was separated from the potter 's field by a stretch of meadow land. A part of the forest to the north cut through this meadow. The distance was than we wanted. We could get no house without going on the side of the field, out of the factory district., we were not. There were no people between us and our source of supplies. The walk was a, but we could move our bodies without disturbance. Our practice was from the start. It was to please doctors. It was to be a burden for students whsoe interest lay.\n###\nWhen he and I obtained our degrees at the medical school of Miskatonic University, and sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners, we took great care not to say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated, and as near as possible to the potter\u2019s field. Reticence such as this is seldom without a cause, nor indeed was ours; for our requirements were those resulting from a life-work distinctly unpopular. Outwardly we were doctors only, but beneath the surface were aims of far greater and more terrible moment\u2014for the essence of Herbert West\u2019s existence was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown, in which he hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the graveyard\u2019s cold clay. Such a quest demands strange materials, among them fresh human bodies; and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable things one must live quietly and not far from a place of informal interment. West and I had met in college, and I had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous experiments. Gradually I had come to be his inseparable assistant, and now that we were out of college we had to keep together. It was not easy to find a good opening for two doctors in company, but finally the influence of the university secured us a practice in Bolton\u2014a factory town near Arkham, the seat of the college. The Bolton Worsted Mills are the largest in the Miskatonic Valley, and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local physicians. We chose our house with the greatest care, seizing at last on a rather run-down cottage near the end of Pond Street; five numbers from the closest neighbour, and separated from the local potter\u2019s field by only a stretch of meadow land, bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north. The distance was greater than we wished, but we could get no nearer house without going on the other side of the field, wholly out of the factory district. We were not much displeased, however, since there were no people between us and our sinister source of supplies. The walk was a trifle long, but we could haul our silent specimens undisturbed. Our practice was surprisingly large from the very first\u2014large enough to please most young doctors, and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students whose real interest lay elsewhere."}

And it was there that fulfilment came, and he met the cortege of knights come from Celepha\u00efs to bear him thither forever. Handsome knights they were, astride roan horses and clad in shining armour with tabards of cloth-of-gold curiously emblazoned. So numerous were they, that Kuranes almost mistook them for an army, but their leader told him they were sent in his honour; since it was he who had created Ooth-Nargai in his dreams, on which account he was now to be appointed its chief god for evermore. Then they gave Kuranes a horse and placed him at the head of the cavalcade, and all rode majestically through the downs of Surrey and onward toward the region where Kuranes and his ancestors were born. It was very strange, but as the riders went on they seemed to gallop back through Time; for whenever they passed through a village in the twilight they saw only such houses and villages as Chaucer or men before him might have seen, and sometimes they saw knights on horseback with small companies of retainers. When it grew dark they travelled more swiftly, till soon they were flying uncannily as if in the air. In the dim dawn they came upon the village which Kuranes had seen alive in his childhood, and asleep or dead in his dreams. It was alive now, and early villagers courtesied as the horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that ends in the abyss of dream. Kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night, and wondered what it would look like by day; so he watched anxiously as the column approached its brink. Just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the east and hid all the landscape in its effulgent draperies. The abyss was now a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour, and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations. Endlessly down the horsemen floated, their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness, the brightness of the city Celepha\u00efs, and the sea-coast beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky."}

While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlight January night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the Turk\u2019s Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance, but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible. Parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening, but nothing rewarded their search.

It was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity\u2014and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before.

The naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men, and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced. They had given up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled."}

He noted the same awful smell like was smelled when the tracks were found last Monday morning. Further, she states he said there was a swishing, lapping sound, more than what the bending trees.

Tiredness, the philosophers have worked, eaten, slept. Done the proper things as citizens without complaint. We no longer wish for magic from distant hills. We no longer sigh for secrets that appear like geren reefs from a bottomless sea. The sameness of our dyas does not make us sad anymore. Our well-controlled thoughts are enough for our imagination. Our good wives become heavier, and our children become older, more boring, and more useful. We always smile with pride correctly when needed. Our eyes do not have any restless light. If we ever listen for serious bells. Distant elf horns, it is only at night when old dreams come. We have never seen Kingsport again. Our families did not like the odd old houses.

The sameness of his days no longer gives him sorrow, and well-disciplined thoughts have grown enough for his imagination.

In his glance there is not any restless light, and if he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering.

Olney saw that the distant eastern windows were not open. They were closed against the hazy sky with thick, dull panes like old bottle glass. The bearded host seemed young. Yet his eyes held the depth of ancient secrets. From the wonderful old stories he told, one could guess the villagers were right. They said he had spoken with the sea mists and the sky clouds. This was ever since a village existed to see his quiet home from the plain below. The day passed slowly. Olney cnotinued to listen to tales of old times and distant lands. He heard how the Kings of Atlantis fought slipper,y unholy things. These things crawled from cracks in the ocean floor. He heard how the columned, weedy temple of Poseidonis is still seen at midnight by lost ships. Those ships know they are lost when they see it. Years of the Titans were remembered. But the host became nervous when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos. This was before the gods or even the Elder Ones were born. It was when only other gods came to dance on the peak of Hatheg-Kla. That peak is in the stony desert near Utlhar, beyond the river Skai. At that moment, a knock came on the door. It was the ancient door studded with nails, beyond which lay only a white cloud void. Olney jumped in fear. The bearded man signaled him to stay quiet. He walked softly to the door to look out through a tiny peephole. He did not like what he saw. He put a finger to his lips. Tiptoed to shut. Lock all the windows. Then he returned to the old bench beside his guest. Then Olney saw a strange black shape linger against each dim little window in turn. The caller moved around curiously outside before leaving. He was glad his host did not answer the knock. For there are strange beings in the great void. One who seeks dreams must be careful not to disturb or meet the wrong ones. Then shadows began to gather. First, shy ones under the table, then bolder ones in the dark paneled corners. The bearded man made mysterious praying gestures. He lit tall candles in oddly shaped brass candlesticks.\n###\nThe small room seemed green with a dim aqueous light, and Olney saw that the far windows to the east were not open, but shut against the misty aether with dull thick panes like the bottoms of old bottles. That bearded host seemed young, yet looked out of eyes steeped in the elder mysteries; and from the tales of marvellous ancient things he related, it must be guessed that the village folk were right in saying he had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky ever since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from the plain below. And the day wore on, and still Olney listened to rumours of old times and far places, and heard how the Kings of Atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in ocean\u2019s floor, and how the pillared and weedy temple of Poseidonis is still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships, who know by its sight that they are lost. Years of the Titans were recalled, but the host grew timid when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos before the gods or even the Elder Ones were born, and when only the other gods came to dance on the peak of Hatheg-Kla in the stony desert near Ulthar, beyond the river Skai. It was at this point that there came a knocking on the door; that ancient door of nail-studded oak beyond which lay only the abyss of white cloud. Olney started in fright, but the bearded man motioned him to be still, and tiptoed to the door to look out through a very small peep-hole. What he saw he did not like, so pressed his fingers to his lips and tiptoed around to shut and lock all the windows before returning to the ancient settle beside his guest. Then Olney saw lingering against the translucent squares of each of the little dim windows in succession a queer black outline as the caller moved inquisitively about before leaving; and he was glad his host had not answered the knocking. For there are strange objects in the great abyss, and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet the wrong ones. Then the shadows began to gather; first little furtive ones under the table, and then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners. And the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks."}

The larger amount of particle debris there, prevented any confusion abuot the main spot among this excess of equally gray surfaces. Still, I decided to continue my orderly inspection if any more complexity appeared. Clean tracks, of course, could no longer be expected.

Carter did not experience much of these modern freedoms. Their quality and dirtiness sickened a spirit that loved only beauty. At the same time, his reason fought against the weak logic their supporters used. They tried to cover raw impulse with a sacredness taken from the idols they had thrown away. He saw that most of them, like the religious leaders they had cast off, could not escape the false idea that life has a meaning separate from the meaning people dream into it. They could not put aside the crude idea of morals. Duties beyond those of beauty. They could not do this even when all Nature screamed of life's lack of consciousness. Its non-personal lack of morality in the of their scientific discoveries. Stubborn with their already formed illusions of justice, freedom. Logical agreement, they threw off the knowledge. The ways along with the beliefs. They never stopped to think that this knowldege. These ways were the only creators of their present thoughts. They were the only guides. Standards in a meaningless universe without fixed goals. Stable points for comparison. Having lost these man-made frameworks, their lives became of direction and interesting drama. In the end, they tried to drown their boredom in busy activity. Pretended usefulness, in noise. Excitement, in crude shwo. When these things became boring, disappointing, or sickening through disgust, they developed irony and bitterness. They found fault with the way society was ordered. They could never realize that their raw foundations were as changing. Contraidctory as the gods of their elders. They could never realize that the satisfaction of one moment is the poison of the next. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in dream. The world had thrown away this comfort when, in its worship of the real, it threw away the secrets of childhood. Amidst this chaos of emptiness. Unease Carter tried to live in a way fitting for a man of sharp thought. family background. With his draems fading under the mockery of the times, he could not believe in anything. The love of harmony kept him clsoe to the customs of his people. His social position. He walked without feeling through the cities of people. He sighed because no view seemed completely real. Every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs. Every quick look at plazas with railings in the first lamps of evening only reminded him of dreams he had once known. They made him homesick for airy lands he no longer knew how to find.\n###\nThey had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety for those of licence and anarchy. Carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms; for their cheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone, while his reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions tried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had discarded. He saw that most of them, in common with their cast-off priestcraft, could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it; and could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty, even when all Nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries. Warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice, freedom, and consistency, they cast off the old lore and the old ways with the old beliefs; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments, and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or stable points of reference. Having lost these artificial settings, their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest; till at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended usefulness, noise and excitement, barbaric display and animal sensation. When these things palled, disappointed, or grew nauseous through revulsion, they cultivated irony and bitterness, and found fault with the social order. Never could they realise that their brute foundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their elders, and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the next. Calm, lasting beauty comes only in dream, and this solace the world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the secrets of childhood and innocence. Amidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest Carter tried to live as befitted a man of keen thought and good heritage. With his dreams fading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything, but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and station. He walked impassive through the cities of men, and sighed because no vista seemed fully real; because every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known, and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find."}

He showed us all the paintings and drawings he had. This included some pen and ink sketches. We truly believe these would have gotten him expelled from the club if many members had seen them.

For over two years, the observer partly succeeded in pushing away these thoughts. His father got him a job in an insurance office. He immersed himself in routine work as much as possible. However, in the winter of 1930\u201331, the dreams started. At first they were rare and subtle. But they became more frequent and vivid over the weeks. Great watery spaces appeared before him. He seemed to walk through huge sunken halls and mazes of weedy Cycloepan walls. Grotesque fish were his companions. Then other shapes began to appear.

In about twenty minutes vehicle stopped at a pavde curb near the concrete wall of the road. On one side I could see the whole street as it stretched from the curb down to the old business district. On the other side, very close by, I faced the plain, useful. Perfectly kept front of a large shelter. It was clearly kiosk, made from solid granite. I can only guess about the original construction of this single massive thing. The front, which is quite large, seems to hide a continuous hollow inside. Its panels are many and evenly placed. In the center is a large glass door. It is reached by a plain set of steps. It is surrounded by simple carvings like figures of commuters in relief. Foremost of all are the great pillars and lintel. Both are decorated with symbols of unclear purpose. They obviously show city rules. Schedules of routes. Buses with strange number codes for a mechanical timetable. The design is of the most ordinary efficiency. It is mostly modern in idea, yet strangely impersonal. It gives a feeling of terrilbe permanence. It seems like the most ancient, not the modern, ancestor of city architecture. Nor can I doubt that every detail of this massive building was made from the quarried mineral deposits of our planet. It is clearly a part of the city wall. Yet I cannot imagine how the vast inside was ever lit. Perhaps a wire or series of wires provided the energy. Neither age nor exposure has worn away the functional plainness of this awful structure\u2014for it truly must be a structure. Today, after countless hours, it stands unchanged. Permanent in the constant glare. Noise of a city street.\n###\nIn about twenty minutes the vehicle halted at a paved curb close to the concrete wall of the thoroughfare. On one side I could survey the entire avenue as it stretched from the curb down to the old commercial district; on the other side, in startling proximity, I was confronted by the starkly utilitarian and perfectly maintained facade of a great shelter, evidently a kiosk, fashioned from the solid granite. Of the original construction of this monolithic thing I can only make conjectures. The facade, of considerable magnitude, apparently conceals a continuous hollow interior; for its panels are many and symmetrically distributed. In the centre yawns a great glass door, reached by an unadorned flight of steps, and surrounded by austere etchings like the figures of commuters in relief. Foremost of all are the great pillars and lintel, both adorned with sigils of inscrutable purpose; obviously denoting municipal ordinances and schedules of routes and conveyances bearing strange numerical designations in service of a mechanical timetable. The design is of the most mundane efficiency, largely modern in idea, yet strangely impersonal. It imparts an impression of terrible permanence, as though it were the most ancient rather than the contemporary ancestor of civic architecture. Nor can I doubt that every detail of this massive edifice was fashioned from the quarried mineral deposits of our planet. It is palpably a part of the urban wall, though how the vast interior was ever illuminated I cannot imagine. Perhaps a conduit or series of conduits furnished the energy. Neither age nor exposure has corroded the functional austerity of this awful structure\u2014for structure indeed it must be\u2014and today after countless hours it stands unaltered and immutable in the ceaseless glare and cacophony of a metropolitan artery."}

Upon returning at 1 A.M., Danforth was nearly hysterical, but he kept very good control. No persuasion was needed to get his promise.

It was the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such height which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us. On our return at 1 A.M. Danforth was close to hysterics, but kept an admirably stiff upper lip. It took no persuasion to make him promise not to shew our sketches and the other things we brought away in our pockets, not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside, and to hide our camera films for private development later on; so that part of my present story will be as new to Pabodie, McTighe, Ropes, Sherman, and the rest as it will be to the world in general.

This city ruled the world before Africa rose from the sea. The story includes its struggles as the sea shrank. The desert moved into the fertile valley where the city was. Its wars and vitcories, its problems and losses are seen. Then its fight against the desert is seen. Thousands of its peopel were shown as reptiles in the story. They were forced to cut their way down through the rock in a mavrelous way. They went to another world their prophets had told them about. It is all very and realistic. Its link to the frightening descent that was made is clear. The passages are even recognized.\n###\nHolding this view, I thought I could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the nameless city; the tale of a mighty sea-coast metropolis that ruled the world before Africa rose out of the waves, and of its struggles as the sea shrank away, and the desert crept into the fertile valley that held it. I saw its wars and triumphs, its troubles and defeats, and afterward its terrible fight against the desert when thousands of its people\u2014here represented in allegory by the grotesque reptiles\u2014were driven to chisel their way down through the rocks in some marvellous manner to another world whereof their prophets had told them.

He wrote and studied in a gable that felt. He wrestled with figure.s Formulas when he was not lying on his iron bed. His hearing became and. He had stopped the clock on the mantel. Its ticking had started to sound like artillery to him. At night, the movements of the city bothered him. The sound of rats in the walls. The creaking of wood in the house felt like a chaos to him. The darkness was of sounds he could not explain. Yet he shook with fear that those noises would stop. He feared that if they stopped, he would hear, quieter noises hiding behind them. He was in the city of Arkham. Its legends changed. The roofs with two slopes clustered. They swayed and sagged over attics. Witches hid in those attics from the King 's men in the, days of the Province. In that city, Nor was a place filled with memories than his room. This was because this house and room had sheltered Keziah Mason. No one could explain his escape from Salem Gaol. That happened in 1692. The jailer went. He talked about a, thing with fangs. It ran out of Keziah 's cell. Not Cotton Mather could explain the marks on the stone walls. The marks were curves and angles. They were smeared with a, fluid. Gilman should not have studied. calculus and quantum physics are for any mind. Mixing them with folklore makes it. Trying to fidn a, truth behind the horror of the Gothic tales. The stories told by the fireplace is. One can not expect to be from strain from that. Gilman came from Haverhill. after starting college in Arkham did he link his math to the legends of magic. The atmosphere of the town worked on his mind in way.s The professors at Miskatnoic told him to rest. They reduced his course load in areas. They stopped him from reading books. Those books were about forbidden secrets. They were kept locked in a vault in the university library.\n###\nBehind everything crouched the brooding, festering horror of the ancient town, and of the mouldy, unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed. His ears were growing sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable degree, and he had long ago stopped the cheap mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery. At night the subtle stirring of the black city outside, the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions, and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house, were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium. The darkness always teemed with unexplained sound\u2014and yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other, fainter, noises which he suspected were lurking behind them. He was in the changeless, legend-haunted city of Arkham, with its clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the King\u2019s men in the dark, olden days of the Province. Nor was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured him\u2014for it was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old Keziah Mason, whose flight from Salem Gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain. That was in 1692\u2014the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small, white-fanged furry thing which scuttled out of Keziah\u2019s cell, and not even Cotton Mather could explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red, sticky fluid. Possibly Gilman ought not to have studied so hard. Non-Euclidean calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain; and when one mixes them with folklore, and tries to trace a strange background of multi-dimensional reality behind the ghoulish hints of the Gothic tales and the wild whispers of the chimney-corner, one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension. Gilman came from Haverhill, but it was only after he had entered college in Arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder magic. Something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his imagination. The professors at Miskatonic had urged him to slacken up, and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points. Moreover, they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university library."}

We talked far into the night. My uncle grew sleepy. I reminded him to lie down for his two - hour sleep. A Something - like fear chilled me as I sat there alone in the early hours. I say alone, because one who sits by a sleeper is truly alone. He may be more alone thna he knwos. My uncle breathed heavily. His deep breaths mixed with the [THING] outside. Another sound punctuated them. It was the nerve - racking sound of distant dripping [THING] inside. The [THING] was disgustingly damp even in dry weather. In this storm, it was like a swamp. I studied the loose, old stonework of the walls. I saw it by the fungus light and the weak rays from the [THING]. The rays came through the screened windows. Once, the foul air of the place seemed about to make me sick. I opened the [THING]. I looked up and down the [THING]. I feasted my eyes on familiar sights. I feasted my nostrils on the clean air. Still, nothing happened to reward my watching. I yawned many times. Tiredness overcame fear. Then my uncle stirred in his sleep. This attracted my notice. He had turned restlessly on the cot several times in the last half of the first hour. But now he breathed with unusual irregularity. Sometimes he heaved a sigh. The sigh held qualities of a choking moan. I turned my electric flashlight on him. I found his [THING] turned away. So I got up and walked to the other side of the cot. I flashed the light again to see if he seemed in pain. What I saw unnerved me very much. This was surprising, considering it was not very important. It must have been the link between any odd event. The evil nature of our place. Surely the event itself was not scary or unnatural. It was simply this. My uncle 's facial expression was disturbe.d No doubt strange dreams caused this. Our situation prompted the dreams. His [THING] showed much agitation. It did not seem like him at all. His usual expression was one of kind and well - bred calm. But now many emotions seemed to struggle within him. I think, overall, it was this variety that mainly disturbed me. My uncle gasped and tossed. His disturbance grew. His eyes were now open wide. He seemed not one [THING] but many men. He suggested a curious quality of being a stranger to himself.\n###\nSuch was our frame of mind as we talked\u2014far into the night, till my uncle\u2019s growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie down for his two-hour sleep. Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hours alone\u2014I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone; perhaps more alone than he can realise. My uncle breathed heavily, his deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside, and punctuated by another nerve-racking sound of distant dripping water within\u2014for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather, and in this storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose, antique masonry of the walls in the fungus-light and the feeble rays which stole in from the street through the screened windows; and once, when the noisome atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door and looked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights and my nostrils on the wholesome air. Still nothing occurred to reward my watching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better of apprehension. Then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity, occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan. I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted, so rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the light to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality. It must have been merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in itself frightful or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle\u2019s facial expression, disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our situation prompted, betrayed considerable agitation, and seemed not at all characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly and well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling within him. I think, on the whole, that it was this variety which chiefly disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing perturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one but many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself."}

Not the horror of my position in that hallway of reptiles. wlal paintings could match the dread I felt. I was miles below the world I knew. I faced another world of light and fog. The dread came form the age of the place and its spirit. that measuring it seems seemed to look down from the stones. Rock - carved temples in the nameless city. The of the maps in the wall paintings showed oceans. Continents that man has forgotten. and there was some shape. No person could say what might have happened in the ages since the paintings stopped. No one could say since the death - hating race gave in to decay. Life had filled these caves and the glowing land beyond. I was with remains. I shook to think of the ages through which these remains had kept a. there came another burst of that fear. It had taken hold of me from time to time since I saw the valley. The nameless city under a moon. Despite my tiredness, I found myself jumping up to a sitting position. I stared along the hallway toward the tunnels that rose to the world. My feelings were like those that had made me avoid the nameless city at night. They were to explain as they were., a moment, I received an shock. It came in the form of a sound. It was the sound that had broken the silence of these tomb - depths. It was a, moaning. It was like a crowd of condemned spirits. It came from the direction I was staring. Its sound grew. it echoed through the passage. At the time, I became of growing flow of air. It came from the tunnels and the city. The touch of this air seeemd to bring my balance. I remembered the winds that had riesn around the mouth of the hole each sunset. One of them had helped show the hidden tunnels to me. I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was. I prepared myself to resist the wind. It was sweeping down to its cave home as it had swept out at evening.\n###\nMy fears, indeed, concerned the past rather than the future. Not even the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes, miles below the world I knew and faced by another world of eerie light and mist, could match the lethal dread I felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul. An ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from the primal stones and rock-hewn temples in the nameless city, while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and continents that man has forgotten, with only here and there some vaguely familiar outline. Of what could have happened in the geological aeons since the paintings ceased and the death-hating race resentfully succumbed to decay, no man might say. Life had once teemed in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond; now I was alone with vivid relics, and I trembled to think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent and deserted vigil. Suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever since I first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon, and despite my exhaustion I found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world. My sensations were much like those which had made me shun the nameless city at night, and were as inexplicable as they were poignant. In another moment, however, I received a still greater shock in the form of a definite sound\u2014the first which had broken the utter silence of these tomb-like depths. It was a deep, low moaning, as of a distant throng of condemned spirits, and came from the direction in which I was staring. Its volume rapidly grew, till soon it reverberated frightfully through the low passage, and at the same time I became conscious of an increasing draught of cold air, likewise flowing from the tunnels and the city above. The touch of this air seemed to restore my balance, for I instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the abyss each sunset and sunrise, one of which had indeed served to reveal the hidden tunnels to me. I looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near, so braced myself to resist the gale which was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening."}

They were wooden former whalers, strrengthened for ice and with auxiliary steam. The Nathaniel Deryb Pickman Foundation, with some special donations, paidd for the expedition. So our preparations were very thorough even without much public attention. The dogs, sleds, machines, camp materials. Unassembled plane parts for our five planes arrived in Boston. Our ships were loaded there. We were very well equipped for our specific goals. For supplies, routine, transport. Camp building, we followed the excellent example of our many recent.

About an hour ago Zeb Whateley here we heard the phone ringing. It was Mrs. Corey, George's wife, who lives down by the junction. She says the hired boy Luther was out driving the cows in from the storm after the lightning bolt. He saw all the trees bending at the mouth of the glen, on the opopsite side from here.

At that moment, someone knocked on the door. The door was old, made of oak with nails. Outside was only a vast white cloud. Olnye was scared, but the bearded man signaled him to stay quiet. The bearded man walked quietly to the door and looked out through a tiny hole. He did not like what he saw. He put his fingers to his lips and quietly closed and locked all the windows. Then he returned to the old bench near his guest. A strange black shape coudl be seen against each dim window as the visitor moved around outside. The viistor left after looking around.

What he saw he did not like, so pressed his fingers to his lips and tiptoed around to shut and lock all the windows before returning to the ancient settle beside his guest. Then Olney saw lingering against the translucent squares of each of the little dim windows in succession a queer black outline as the caller moved inquisitively about before leaving; and he was glad his host had not answered the knocking. For there are strange objects in the great abyss, and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet the wrong ones."}

But something about it bothered the observer almost as much as its looks pleased him. Maybe it was too pale, or had no expression, or did not fit the area. This made the observer feel uneasy. Still, the observer followed him. In those dull days, his search for old beauty. Mystery was the only thing that kept him going. He considered it a rare gift from Fate to meet someone whose similar searches seemed to have gone much further than his own.\n###\nAs he spoke, I caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a solitary attic window.

At least, people talked most about these. If the content was more ordinary, a flyer would disappear early for no reason. It made space for another more typical advertisement. There seemed to be a hidden layer in the pile. The oldest mail controlled this layer. It was sometimes hidden from all but a few papers. Provenance and not the date clearly formed this layer. Several items that came with the main group entered it. The ad from a faraway store, which came with a bill, the second paper in the fifth envelope, became a known problem for sorters all over the desk. It was the ghostly center of a very boring old filing system. This system was not yet outdated near the cabinet's side. Preserved in record books also tells a dull story. It deos not show the same idea. It is the story of the last utility bill. Soon after it arrived with the group of magazines, he. His assistant threw it away. Both people who threw it away felt better.

If of more mundane content, it was said, a circular would early and inexplicably vanish to make way for another more typical solicitation. There seemed to be an inner stratum in the pile, presided over by the oldest of the correspondence, and sometimes concealed except to a few documents. Provenance rather than date was evidently the basis of this stratum, for it was entered by several which arrived with the main bundle. The promotional missive from a distant retailer, companion to a statement, the secondary paper of the fifth envelope, became a familiar bane of sorters all over the desk, and the spectral centre of a particularly tedious old filing system not yet obsolete near the cabinet's edge. Preserved in ledgers, too, though not illustrating the same point, is the monotonous tale of the final utility notice, which shortly after its arrival with the batch of periodicals was discarded by him and his assistant, both of the disposers being relieved and satisfied by the manager to whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the department."}

He stopped at the sounds he heard coming from the now unused addition of the accounting department. Forms were apparently being moved about and papers wildly rustled. After stepping to the doorway, Mr. Wilkins saw the clerk inside. He was excitedly gathering a huge armful of office material of every size and shape. clerk's appearance was very tired and worn. He dropped his whole load with a jump at the sound of his boss's voice. At the older man's order, he sat down. For some time he listened to the warnings he had so long deserved. There was no big scene. At the end of the talk, he agreed that his boss was right. His erasures, mutterings, notes, and ink-stain smells were indeed unforgivable annoyances. He agreed to a plan of greater order. But he insisted on a continuation of his extreme independence. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely office research. He could get a small study sapce elsewhere for any such spoken rituals as might be needed at a later time. For the confusion and alarm of the receptionist, he expressed the deepest regret. He explained that the number chants later overheard were part of a complex symbol systme. It was designed to create a certain process atmosphere. His use of hard-to-understand insurance terms somewhat confused Mr. Wilkins. The final feeling was one of clear skill. Calm, despite a mysterious tension of the greatest seriousness. The meeting was really quite without a clear result. As the clerk picked up his armful and left the room, Mr. Wilkins hardly knwe what to think of the whole matter. It was as mysterious as the wrong filing of the old Henderson claim. Its confusing foledr had been found an hour before in the supply closet. It had mysterious approvals and fear-twisted notes in the margins.\n###\nMr. Wilkins rose at the close of the business day and started toward the filing cabinet for the quarterly reports. In the central aisle, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused annex of the accounting department. Forms were apparently being shuffled about and documents wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the threshold Mr. Wilkins beheld the clerk within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of bureaucratic matter of every size and shape. The clerk\u2019s aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his supervisor\u2019s voice. At the elder man\u2019s command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his supervisor was right, and that his erasures, mutterings, annotations, and ink-stain odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater order, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme autonomy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely clerical research; and he could obtain a carrel elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the confusion and consternation of the receptionist he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the numerical incantations later overheard were part of an elaborate symbology designed to create a certain procedural atmosphere. His use of abstruse actuarial terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Wilkins, but the parting impression was one of undeniable competence and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as the clerk picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Wilkins hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the misfiling of the old Henderson claim, whose confounding folio had been found an hour before in the supply closet, with cryptic endorsements and fear-distorted marginalia."}

It is seen that the few people who visited the house often found Lavinia alone on the first floor. At the same time, strange cries and footsteps came frmo the closed-off second floor. She never said what her father and the boy were doing upstairs. Once, a joking fish seller tried the locked stairway door. She turned pale and showed great fear. That seller reported to the people at the Dunwich Village store that he thought he heard a horse walking on the floor above. The people thought about the door and the ramp.

Strange shape are seen looking down like pillars of some evil Druidic temple. They muffle the thunder, quiet the harsh wind, and let in little rain. Beyond the marked tree trunks in the background, lit by weak flashes of filtered lightning, rise the damp, ivy-covered stones of the empty mansion. Somewhat closer is the abandoned Dutch garden. Beds are spoiled by a white, fungal, foul, overgrown plant life that never saw full daylight. Closest of all is the graveyard. There, misshapen trees wave crazy branches as their roots move unholy stones. Draw poison from what lies below. Sometimes, under the brown cover of leaves rotting in the ancient forest darkness, one can see the evil shapes of some low mounds. These mounds are typical of the area struck by lightning.\n###\nThe scene of my excavations would alone have been enough to unnerve any ordinary man. Baleful primal trees of unholy size, age, and grotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish Druidic temple; muffling the thunder, hushing the clawing wind, and admitting but little rain. Beyond the scarred trunks in the background, illumined by faint flashes of filtered lightning, rose the damp ivied stones of the deserted mansion, while somewhat nearer was the abandoned Dutch garden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white, fungous, foetid, overnourished vegetation that never saw full daylight. And nearest of all was the graveyard, where deformed trees tossed insane branches as their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay below. Now and then, beneath the brown pall of leaves that rotted and festered in the antediluvian forest darkness, I could trace the sinister outlines of some of those low mounds which characterised the lightning-pierced region."}

It snet a storm of colored. fragments shooting up to the sky, fragments our universe would reject. The sickness that had vanished was followed through the quickly closing vapors. A moment later, they saw that the vapors had also vanished. Behind and below was only a darkness. The men did not dare go back into it. All around, a rising wind blew. It seemed to sweep down in black, icy gusts from space. It shrieked and howled. It lashed the fields and twisted woods in a mad, cosmic frenzy. Soon, the trembling group realized it was no use waiting for the moon to show what was left down there at Nahum's place.\n###\nThen without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a rocket or meteor, leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out.

He had been happy with just its use. The dull pain of waking had turned his look toward more secret qualities. He had felt excited by the suggestions of life force hidden inside the common bean. The daily making had for him become a show of magic steps. Sometimes it shone and steamed wiht a sweet promise like in the oldest ceremonies. Sometimes it suggested truths behind the simplest kitchen tools like in the more hidden. Special recipes of forgotten experts. He would often think it was kind that most busy people miss the deepest secrets of the coffee making. He thought that if aware minds were ever in touch with the secrets opened by the heat. The crush, the resulting awakenings would soon break the ordinary peace of the home. They would also threaten the very structure of daily calm. All this thinking was surely too much. But a sharp watch on details and a strong sense of need balanced it well. The user was happy to let his habits stay as partly seen. Private acts to be done seriously. Worry came only when speed threw him into a mess of quick fixes too sudden. Sneaky to properly fix.\n###\nTo the somnambulant soul the sense of latent potency in the morning ritual was ever present. In earlier hours he had felt the simple comfort and warmth of the brew, and had been content with mere utility; but weariness and the dull ache of waking had turned his gaze toward more arcane properties, and he had thrilled at the imputations of vitality hidden within the humble bean. The daily preparation had for him come to be a phantasmagoria of alchemical processes; now glistening and steaming with a dark, fragrant promise as in the most profound of ancient rites, now hinting at revelations behind the commonest kitchen implements as in the more subtle and esoteric formulations of forgotten adepts. He would often regard it as merciful that most persons of hurried routine ignore the inmost mysteries of the percolation; for, he reasoned, if awakened minds were ever placed in fullest contact with the secrets unlocked by the heat and the grind, the resultant awakenings would soon not only shatter the mundane peace of the household, but threaten the very fabric of diurnal complacency. All this contemplation was no doubt excessive, but a keen attention to detail and a deep sense of necessity ably offset it. The practitioner was satisfied to let his rituals remain as half-glimpsed and private ceremonies to be solemnly performed; and disquiet came only when haste flung him into a chaos of improvisation too abrupt and insidious to properly rectify."}

Each person who saw it later described the shapes differently. Then, tied-up Hero made a sound. No one had ever heard a horse make such a sound before or since. Everyone in the low-ceilinged room covered their ears. Ammi turned away from the window in horror and sickness. Words could not describe the sound. When Ammi looked out the window again, the poor animal lay still on the moonlit ground. It was between the broken parts of the buggy. That was the last time they saw Hero until they buried him the next day. But there was no time to be sad then. Almost at the same time, a detective quietly pointed out something terrible in the room with them. Without the lamp light, they could see a faint glow. It was spreading through the whole apartment. It glowed on the wide floorboards and the piece of old carpet. It shimmered on the window frames with small panes. It moved up and down the corner posts. It sparkled around the shelf and fireplace. It even affected the doors and furniture. It grew stronger each minute.

In the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment. It glowed on the broad-planked floor and the fragment of rag carpet, and shimmered over the sashes of the small-paned windows. It ran up and down the exposed corner-posts, coruscated about the shelf and mantel, and infected the very doors and furniture. Each minute saw it strengthen, and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave that house."}

Physicians had told me of the danger of these attacks. I knew there was no time to lose. I remembered what the landlady spoke about the man helping the worker.

The ammonia ceased to drip, and as I cleaned up what had spilled and opened the window for air, I heard the landlady\u2019s heavy footsteps above me. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz I had never heard, save for certain sounds as of some gasoline-driven mechanism; since his step was soft and gentle. I wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity. There is, I reflected tritely, an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person who has come down in the world. I might never have known Dr. Mu\u00f1oz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as I sat writing in my room. Physicians had told me of the danger of those spells, and I knew there was no time to be lost; so remembering what the landlady had said about the invalid\u2019s help of the injured workman, I dragged myself upstairs and knocked feebly at the door above mine. My knock was answered in good English by a curious voice some distance to the right, asking my name and business; and these things being stated, there came an opening of the door next to the one I had sought. A rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the hottest of late June, I shivered as I crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness. A folding couch now filled its diurnal role of sofa, and the mahogany furniture, sumptuous hangings, old paintings, and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentleman\u2019s study rather than a boarding-house bedroom.

One sees the unholy Erebus of giant mushrooms, sickly fire, and wet waetr. One sees people in cloaks forimng a half circle around the burning pillar. It was the Yule ceremony. This ceremony is older than huamns and will outlive them. It is the first ceremony of the solstice and the hope of spring after snow. It is a ceremony of fire, evergreen plants, light, and music. In the Stygian cave, the ceremony is seen being performed. Worship is directed toward the unhealthy pillar of flame. Handfuls are taken from the thick plants. The plants shone green in the pale light. They are thronw into the water. This is witnessed. Something with no clear shape is also seen sitting far from the light. It is playing a flute in an unpleasant way. As it played, bad, soft flapping sounds are thought to be heard in the smelly dark where nothing can be seen. But the flaming column is most frightening thing. It shoots up like a vlocano from very deep, unimaginable places. It does not cast shadows like normal fire should. It covers the stone above with a nasty, poisonous green layer. In all that burning, no heat is found. There is only the damp cold feeling of death and decay.\n###\nFainting and gasping, I looked at that unhallowed Erebus of titan toadstools, leprous fire, and slimy water, and saw the cloaked throngs forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar. It was the Yule-rite, older than man and fated to survive him; the primal rite of the solstice and of spring\u2019s promise beyond the snows; the rite of fire and evergreen, light and music. And in the Stygian grotto I saw them do the rite, and adore the sick pillar of flame, and throw into the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic glare. I saw this, and I saw something amorphously squatted far away from the light, piping noisomely on a flute; and as the thing piped I thought I heard noxious muffled flutterings in the foetid darkness where I could not see. But what frightened me most was that flaming column; spouting volcanically from depths profound and inconceivable, casting no shadows as healthy flame should, and coating the nitrous stone above with a nasty, venomous verdigris. For in all that seething combustion no warmth lay, but only the clamminess of death and corruption."}

We had assumed the house was But as we got closer, we were not so sure. The paths were overgorwn with weeds. But they seemed a too well kpet to mean no one lived there. So we knocked on the door instead of trying to open it. We felt a fear we could hardly explain as we did so. We waited on the rough, mossy stone that was the doorstep. We looked at the nearby windows and the glass above the door. We saw that. They were loose. Almost not see-through from dirt, they were not broken. The building must still have people in it, even though it was isolated. Our knocking got no answer. After knocking again, we tried the rusyt latch. The door was not locked. Inside There was a entry room. The plaster was falling from the walls. A faint but very unpleasant smell came through the doorway. We went in, carrying our bicycle, and closed the door behind us. Ahead A staircase went up. door next to it probably led to the basement. Closed doors were to the left and right. They led to rooms on the ground floor.\n###\nI had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned, yet as I approached it I was not so sure; for though the walks were indeed overgrown with weeds, they seemed to retain their nature a little too well to argue complete desertion. Therefore instead of trying the door I knocked, feeling as I did so a trepidation I could scarcely explain. As I waited on the rough, mossy rock which served as a doorstep, I glanced at the neighbouring windows and the panes of the transom above me, and noticed that although old, rattling, and almost opaque with dirt, they were not broken. The building, then, must still be inhabited, despite its isolation and general neglect. However, my rapping evoked no response, so after repeating the summons I tried the rusty latch and found the door unfastened. Inside was a little vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling, and through the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odour. I entered, carrying my bicycle, and closed the door behind me. Ahead rose a narrow staircase, flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar, while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor."}

It came to me that this was the language used by a trapped mind I had known a in my dreams. That mind was from a asteroid. of the life and knowledge from the planet had survived. The asteroid was a piece of that planet. At the time, I remembered that this level of the record halls was for books dealing with planets not from Earth. I stopped looking at this document. I saw that my torchlight was starting to fade. I put in the battery I carried with me., with the light, I started my feverish running. I ran through tangles of walkways and hallways. and I recognized some shelf. I was bothered by the conditions. They made my footsteps echo in these tombs of death. Silence that had lasted for ages. The marks of my shoes behind me in the dust, for thousansd of years, made me shake., if my dreams held any truth, had feet stepped on those floors. My mind hedl no clue about the gaol of my insane running., some force of power pulled at my will and buried mmeories. I felt I was not running without aim. I came to a slope and followed it to levels. Floors flashed by me as I ran. I did not stop to look at them. In my spinning brain, a rhythm had begun to beat. It made my hand twitch in time with it. I wanted to unolck something. I felt that I knew all the twists and pressuers needed to do it. It would be like a safe with a combination lock. Dream or not, I had known and knew. I did not try to explain to myself how any dream.

Its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they had lived through, and I studied the queerly pigmented, brush-drawn letters of the text\u2014symbols utterly unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet known to human scholarship\u2014with a haunting, half-aroused memory. It came to me that this was the language used by a captive mind I had known slightly in my dreams\u2014a mind from a large asteroid on which had survived much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet whereof it formed a fragment. At the same time I recalled that this level of the archives was devoted to volumes dealing with the non-terrestrial planets. As I ceased poring over this incredible document I saw that the light of my torch was beginning to fail, hence quickly inserted the extra battery I always had with me. Then, armed with the stronger radiance, I resumed my feverish racing through unending tangles of aisles and corridors\u2014recognising now and then some familiar shelf, and vaguely annoyed by the acoustic conditions which made my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs of aeon-long death and silence. The very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden dust made me shudder. Never before, if my mad dreams held anything of truth, had human feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements. Of the particular goal of my insane racing, my conscious mind held no hint. There was, however, some force of evil potency pulling at my dazed will and buried recollections, so that I vaguely felt I was not running at random. I came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths. Floors flashed by me as I raced, but I did not pause to explore them. In my whirling brain there had begun to beat a certain rhythm which set my right hand twitching in unison. I wanted to unlock something, and felt that I knew all the intricate twists and pressures needed to do it. It would be like a modern safe with a combination lock. Dream or not, I had once known and still knew. How any dream\u2014or scrap of unconsciously absorbed legend\u2014could have taught me a detail so minute, so intricate, and so complex, I did not attempt to explain to myself."}

They covered three small - paned windows. The windows barely showed against the brightening [THING]. After that, he went to the mantel. He struck flint and steel. He lit two candles from a candelabrum with twelve holders. He made a gesture telling me to speak softly. In this weak light, I saw we were in a spacious library.

We met no person, and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and fewer. The street-lights we first encountered had been of oil, and of the ancient lozenge pattern. Later I noticed some with candles; and at last, after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooden gate in a high wall, we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front of every seventh house\u2014unbelievably colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the sides. This alley led steeply uphill\u2014more steeply than I thought possible in this part of New York\u2014and the upper end was blocked squarely by the ivy-clad wall of a private estate, beyond which I could see a pale cupola, and the tops of trees waving against a vague lightness in the sky. In this wall was a small, low-arched gate of nail-studded black oak, which the man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key. Leading me within, he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path, and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house, which he unlocked and opened for me. We entered, and as we did so I grew faint from a reek of infinite mustiness which welled out to meet us, and which must have been the fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay. My host appeared not to notice this, and in courtesy I kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway, across a hall, and into a room whose door I heard him lock behind us. Then I saw him pull the curtains of the three small-paned windows that barely shewed themselves against the lightening sky; after which he crossed to the mantel, struck flint and steel, lighted two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces, and made a gesture enjoining soft-toned speech. In this feeble radiance I saw that we were in a spacious, well-furnished, and panelled library dating from the first quarter of the eighteenth century, with splendid doorway pediments, a delightful Doric cornice, and a magnificently carved overmantel with scroll-and-urn top."}

But people think these are from the Indians, not from the settlers.\n###\nIn 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps; in which he said: \u201cIt must be allow\u2019d, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Daemons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny\u2019d; the cursed Voices of Azazel and Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now from under Ground by above a Score of credible Witnesses now living. I my self did not more than a Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth cou\u2019d raise up, and which must needs have come from those Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.\u201d Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines; while still others try to explain the Devil\u2019s Hop Yard\u2014a bleak, blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferer\u2019s struggling breath. If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence. These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come down from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old\u2014older by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the nineteenth-century factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hill-tops, but these are more generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers."}

But as I looked again, my view was mixed with worry and disgust. For surely, this buildup was of a very sneaky kind. I felt there must be something moer thna common dirt behind that pale, sticky, ghostly layer. Staring glassy shine. I realized how terrilby the passing of countless days must have affected the surface. Was it not enough to cover any clean surface, even one newer than this bold window into the networks?

At this point, three slow and deliberate knocks were seen to shake the door. White foma could be seen gathreing at mouth of the frantic magician. His fear turned to hard despair. This allowed his anger to return. He was seen to stagger one step toward the table. One might steady oneself on the table's edge. The curtains were still in his right hand. His left hand clawed out. The curtains became tight. Then they fell down from their high fastenings. This let a flood of full moonlight into the room. The brightening sky had predicted this moonlight. In the greenish light, the candles became dim. A new appearance of decay spread over the room. The room smelled of musk. It had wormy wood panels, a sagging floor, a damaged mantel, shaky furniture. This decay also spread over the old mna. It might have been from the same source or from his fear and strong emotion. He was seen to shrink and turn black. He moved unsteadily closer and tried to tear the air with vulture-like claws. Only his eyes remained whole. They glowed with a forceful, wide brightness. This brightness gerw as the skin around them burned and shrank.\n###\nAt this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of the door, and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician.

The curtains, still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me, grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings; admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had presaged.

It is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young, before ever the men of Sarnath came to the land of Mnar, another city stood beside the lake; the grey stone city of Ib, which was old as the lake itself, and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold. Very odd and ugly were these beings, as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely fashioned. It is written on the brick cylinders of Kadatheron that the beings of Ib were in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise above it; that they had bulging eyes, pouting, flabby lips, and curious ears, and were without voice. It is also written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist; they and the vast still lake and grey stone city Ib. However this may be, it is certain that they worshipped a sea-green stone idol chiselled in the likeness of Bokrug, the great water-lizard; before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous. And it is written in the papyrus of Ilarnek, that they one day discovered fire, and thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions. But not much is written of these beings, because they lived in very ancient times, and man is young, and knows little of the very ancient living things. After many aeons men came to the land of Mnar; dark shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks, who built Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron on the winding river Ai. And certain tribes, more hardy than the rest, pushed on to the border of the lake and built Sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earth. Not far from the grey city of Ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of Sarnath, and at the beings of Ib they marvelled greatly. But with their marvelling was mixed hate, for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk. Nor did they like the strange sculptures upon the grey monoliths of Ib, for those sculptures were terrible with great antiquity. Why the beings and the sculptures lingered so late in the world, even until the coming of men, none can tell; unless it was because the land of Mnar is very still, and remote from most other lands both of waking and of dream."}

Besides, would not a connection to a phantom network bring him merely into a phantom site\u2014an aberrant projection of the actual page he sought? He was wholly bewildered as to the relation betwixt signal and latency in all his tribulations."}

They would only be on land that was exposed or almost exposed. This land was slopes and ridges. This was because a mile or two miles of solid ice covered the lower ground. It was not possible to use up drilling depth on areas of just ice. However, Pabodie had made a plan. The plan was to put many copper electrodes into groups of drill holes. Then, use current from a gasoline dynamo to melt areas of ice. This plan could only be tested on an expedition like thta one. The upcoming Starkweather-Moore Expedition wants to use this plan. They want to do this even though warnings have been given since the return from Antarctica.\n###\nOur borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed or nearly exposed land surfaces\u2014these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels. We could not afford to waste drilling depth on any considerable amount of mere glaciation, though Pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a gasoline-driven dynamo. It is this plan\u2014which we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition such as ours\u2014that the coming Starkweather-Moore Expedition proposes to follow despite the warnings I have issued since our return from the antarctic."}

No man had suspected in what part of space it might lie. It might be in the dreamlands around our world. Or it might be in those surrounding some companion of Fomalhaut or Aldebaran. If in our dreamland, it might be reached. three souls since time began had crossed. Recrossed the, gaps to dreamlands. Of those three, two had come. In journeys, there were dangers. There was that danger. It gibbers outside the ordered universe, where no dreams reach. That runi of confusion blasphemes. Bubbles at the center of all infinity. It is the daemon - sultan Azathoth. No lips dare speak his name. He gnaws in, chambers beyond time. He is amidst the muffled, maddening beat of drums. The, whine of flutes. To this pounding and piping dance,, and the gods. They are the,,, Gods. Their soul and messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Carter was warned of these things by the priests Nasht. Kaman - Thah in the cave of flame. he resolved to find the gods on Kadath in the waste, wherever that might be. He resolved to win from them the sight, memory. Shelter of the sunset city. He knew his journey would be and. He knew the Great Ones would be against it. Being in the land of dream, he counted on memories. Tricks to help him. he asked for a farewell blessing from the priests. He thought about his course. He went down the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber. Set out through the wood. In the tunnels of that wood, the and zoogs live. The, oaks twine with searching branches. They shine with the glow of fungi. The zoogs know secrets of the dream - world. A of the waking world. The wood touches the lands of men at two places, though it would be to say where. rumors, events, and disappearances happen among men where the zoogs can go. It is they can not travel outside the world of dream.\n###\nThey reminded him, too, that not only had no man ever been to unknown Kadath, but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie; whether it be in the dreamlands around our world, or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of Fomalhaut or Aldebaran. If in our dreamland, it might conceivably be reached; but only three fully human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands, and of that three two had come back quite mad. There were, in such voyages, incalculable local dangers; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe, where no dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity\u2014the boundless daemon-sultan Azathoth, whose name no lips dare speak aloud, and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable, unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled, maddening beating of vile drums and the thin, monotonous whine of accursed flutes; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly, awkwardly, and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods, the blind, voiceless, tenebrous, mindless Other Gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Of these things was Carter warned by the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in the cavern of flame, but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown Kadath in the cold waste, wherever that might be, and to win from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city. He knew that his journey would be strange and long, and that the Great Ones would be against it; but being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him. So asking a farewell blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his course, he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and set out through the enchanted wood. In the tunnels of that twisted wood, whose low prodigious oaks twine groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi, dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs; who know many obscure secrets of the dream-world and a few of the waking world, since the wood at two places touches the lands of men, though it would be disastrous to say where. Certain unexplained rumours, events, and vanishments occur among men where the zoogs have access, and it is well that they cannot travel far outside the world of dream."}

I tried to understand source of my deep discomfort. It was a large, empty parking lot covering several acers. It was bordered by cracked concrete curbs. It was topped by a group of plain, balck light poles. The time was exactly noon. The strange, long shadows from the still shopping carts made the scene seem eternal if you did not note the harsh, unmoving sun above. It had a depressing sameness. There were wide, empty spaces that seemed would never be filled. There was a flat horizon, a distant tree line and fence, and very quiet surroundings. The long, straight lines and rough, grayish apshalt looked almost smooth. The exception was some thin yellow markings that wandered and faded at uneven distances. In spots, the ground looked oddly dirty, as if leaking some oily substance from below. The patches of green plants weer few and quite dry. Tehy had a veyr odd yellow-brown color. The bushes were surprisingly small for their planned growth. They seemed to want to curl inward toward their own poor soil. As I looked across the emptiness, I flet its strangely still quiet. I noted that the air was unusually calm. The more I thought about it, the more I wondered that any life could exist in such an empty place.\n###\nWhen the sun reached its zenith I surveyed the expanse more intently and attempted to discern the origin of my profound unease. It was a vast, desolate pavement not much under several acres in scope, bounded by cracked concrete curbs and crowned by a network of stark, black light poles. The hour was precisely noon, but the strange, elongated shadows cast by the stationary carts made the scene seem timeless when one did not mark the pitiless, motionless orb above. It had a bleak uniformity, yawning, vacant spaces that seemed never to be filled, a flat horizon, a receding tree line and fence, and singularly silent surroundings. The long, straight lines and coarse-grained, greyish asphalt seemed almost seamless except for some sparse yellow markings that straggled and faded in irregular intervals; and in places the surface seemed queerly stained, as if bleeding some oleaginous effluvium from beneath. The islands of greenery were few and heavily withered, and had a very unusual yellowish-brown hue. The shrubs were strikingly stunted in proportion to the intended cultivation, and seemed to have a tendency to curl inward upon their own barren soil. As my gaze traversed the emptiness I perceived its peculiarly stagnant silence and noted that the air was inordinately still. The more I contemplated it the more I marvelled that any life could stir within such a void."}

Often the speaker had to be brought back to the point. Scientific details were put together from a fading memory of professors' words. Gpas were filled where the logic stopped. Wehn the story was done, it was no surprise the speaker's mind had broken a little. It was no surprise the people of Arkham would not talk about the blasted heath. A quick return was made to the hotel before sunset. One did not want to be outside when the stars came out. The next day, a return to Boston was made to quit the job.

Many of Sheehan's regular customers likely remember the day young Alfred Trever arrived. He was a good \"find\". He was a rich and lively young man who would do anything fully. At least, that was what Pete Schultz said. Pete Schultz was Sheehan's \"runner\". He met the boy at Lawrence College, in the small town of Appleton, Wisconsin. Trever was the son of important parents in Appleton. His father, Karl Trever, was a well-known lawyer and citizen. His mother was famous as a poet. She used her maiden name, Eleanor Wing. Alfred was himself a noted scholar and pote. But he had a childish lack of responsibility. This made him perfect for Sheehan's runner. He was blond, handsome, and spoiled. He was lively. Eager to try the various forms of wild living he had read. At Lawrence he was a leading member in the fake club \"Tappa Tappa Keg\". He was the wildest and happiest of the wild, fun-loving young men there. But this silly college fun did not satisfy him. He knew about worse vices from books. He now wanted to experience them directly. Perhaps this wild tendency was partly caused by strict rules at home. Mrs. Trever had a special reason for raising her only child very strictly. In her youth, she was deeply and permanently affected by the horror of wlid living. This came from the case of a man she was once engaged to.\n###\nI do not think that many of Sheehan\u2019s regular patrons will ever forget the day that young Alfred Trever came. He was rather a \u201cfind\u201d\u2014a rich and high-spirited youth who would \u201cgo the limit\u201d in anything he undertook\u2014at least, that was the verdict of Pete Schultz, Sheehan\u2019s \u201crunner\u201d, who had come across the boy at Lawrence College, in the small town of Appleton, Wisconsin. Trever was the son of prominent parents in Appleton. His father, Karl Trever, was an attorney and citizen of distinction, whilst his mother had made an enviable reputation as a poetess under her maiden name of Eleanor Wing. Alfred was himself a scholar and poet of distinction, though cursed with a certain childish irresponsibility which made him an ideal prey for Sheehan\u2019s runner. He was blond, handsome, and spoiled; vivacious and eager to taste the several forms of dissipation about which he had read and heard. At Lawrence he had been prominent in the mock-fraternity of \u201cTappa Tappa Keg\u201d, where he was the wildest and merriest of the wild and merry young roysterers; but this immature, collegiate frivolity did not satisfy him. He knew deeper vices through books, and he now longed to know them at first hand. Perhaps this tendency toward wildness had been stimulated somewhat by the repression to which he had been subjected at home; for Mrs. Trever had particular reason for training her only child with rigid severity. She had, in her own youth, been deeply and permanently impressed with the horror of dissipation by the case of one to whom she had for a time been engaged."}

I am Romnod, and born of the blood of Teloth, but am not old in the ways of the granite city, and yearn daily for the warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song. Beyond the Karthian hills lieth Oonai, the city of lutes and dancing, which men whisper of and say is both lovely and terrible. Thither would I go were I old enough to find the way, and thither shouldst thou go an thou wouldst sing and have men listen to thee. Let us leave the city Teloth and fare together among the hills of spring. Thou shalt shew me the ways of travel and I will attend thy songs at evening when the stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers. And peradventure it may be that Oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even the fair Aira thou seekest, for it is told that thou hast not known Aira since old days, and a name often changeth. Let us go to Oonai, O Iranon of the golden head, where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers, nor ever laugh or frown at what we say.\u201d And Iranon answered: \u201cBe it so, small one; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he must seek the mountains and beyond, and I would not leave thee to pine by the sluggish Zuro. But think not that delight and understanding dwell just across the Karthian hills, or in any spot thou canst find in a day\u2019s, or a year\u2019s, or a lustrum\u2019s journey. Behold, when I was small like thee I dwelt in the valley of Narthos by the frigid Xari, where none would listen to my dreams; and I told myself that when older I would go to Sinara on the southern slope, and sing to smiling dromedary-men in the market-place. But when I went to Sinara I found the dromedary-men all drunken and ribald, and saw that their songs were not as mine, so I travelled in a barge down the Xari to onyx-walled Jaren. And the soldiers at Jaren laughed at me and drave me out, so that I wandered to many other cities. I have seen Stethelos that is below the great cataract, and have gazed on the marsh where Sarnath once stood."}

I had written so much to the proconsul that he had become gravely interested, and had resolved to make a personal inquiry into the horror. He had at length proceeded to Pompelo with his lictors and attendants; there hearing enough rumours to be greatly impressed and disturbed, and standing firmly by his order for the Sabbath's extirpation. Desirous of conferring with one who had studied the subject, he ordered me to accompany Asellius' cohort\u2014and Balbutius had also come along to press his adverse advice, for he honestly believed that drastic military action would stir up a dangerous sentiment of unrest amongst the Vascones both tribal and settled. So here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills\u2014old Scribonius Libo in his toga pr\u00e6texta, the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face, Balbutius with his gleaming helmet and breastplate, blue-shaven lips compressed in conscientiously dogged opposition, young Asellius with his polished greaves and superior sneer, and the curious throng of townsfolk, legionaries, tribesmen, peasants, lictors, slaves, and attendants. I myself seemed to wear a common toga, and to have no especially distinguishing characteristic. And everywhere horror brooded. The town and country folk scarcely dared speak aloud, and the men of Libo's entourage, who had been there nearly a week, seemed to have caught something of the nameless dread. Old Scribonius himself looked very grave, and the sharp voices of us later comers seemed to hold something of curious inappropriateness, as in a place of death or the temple of some mystic god. We entered the pr\u00e6torium and held grave converse. Balbutius pressed his objections, and was sustained by Asellius, who appeared to hold all the natives in extreme contempt while at the same time deeming it inadvisable to excite them. Both soldiers maintained that we could better afford to antagonise the minority of colonists and civilised natives by inaction, than to antagonise a probable majority of tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread rites. I, on the other hand, renewed my demand for action, and offered to accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake. I pointed out that the barbarous Vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain, so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever course we might take; that they had not in the past proved dangerous adversaries to our legions, and that it would ill become the representatives of the Roman People to suffer barbarians to interfere with a course which the justice and prestige of the Republic demanded."}

They found the two individuals unconscious on the blood-stained carpet. They were beaten, scratched, and hurt. Broken pieces of West's bottles and tools were around them.

This was during research on how germ diseases spread. He ordered them burned quickly in large fireplace. They told the police they did not know who their late companion was. West said nervously that he was a friendly stranger. They met him at some downtown bar. location was not certain. They had all been quite cheerful. It was understood that West.

They had a haunting, hard-to-catch quality that seemed to cause fantastic images. It is noted that people who smelled them tended to see brief mirages of huge views. They saw strange hlils or endless rows of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching far away. Ward did not go back to his old walks. Instead, he worked hard on the strange books he brought home. He also did strange studies in his rooms. It was explained thta European sources had greatly expanded his work's possibilities. Great discoveries were promised in the coming years. His older appearance increased his likeness to the Curwen portrait in his library. It is noted that Dr. Willett would often stop by the portrait after a visit. He marveled at how identical they looked. He thought only the small pit above the picture's right eye now separated the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These visits by Willett were done at the request of the senoir Wards. They are recorded as curious events. Ward never turned the doctor away. But it was seen that the young man's inner thoughts could never be reachde. Frequently odd things were noted aobut. There were little wax figures of weird design on shelves or tables. There were partly erased remains of circles, triangles. Pentagrams in chalk. Charcoal on the cleared floor of the large room. And always at night those rhythms and chants thundered. It became very hard to keep servants or stop secret talk about Charles's madness.\n###\nThe odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the picture\u2019s right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willett\u2019s, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young man\u2019s inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charles\u2019s madness."}

They sat there in an evil half-circle. Their legs were on the desert sand. Their pointed hats went into the glowing clouds. They seemed evil, like wolves, and had two heads. Their faces showed anger. Their right hansd were raised. They watched the edge of the human world in a dull and evil way. They guarded with horror the areas of a cold northern world that is not for humans. From their horrible laps rose evil shantaks. These were as big as elephants. But they all ran away wiht crazy laughs. They ran when the first night-gaunts were seen in the misty sky. Northward flew above those gargyole mountains. They flew over miles of dim desert where no landmark ever rose. The clouds became Less and less bright. Finally, one could see only blackness around. But the winged horses never hesitated. They were bred in the darkest caves of earth. They did not see with eyes. They saw with the whole wet surface of their slippery bodies. They flew on and on. They passed winds with strange smells and sounds with unclear meaning. They were always in the thickest darkness. They covered such huge distances that one might wonder if they were still within earth's dreamland.\n###\nThere they squatted, in a hellish half-circle, their legs on the desert sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds; sinister, wolf-like, and double-headed, with faces of fury and right hands raised, dully and malignly watching the rim of man\u2019s world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not man\u2019s. From their hideous laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk, but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of night-gaunts was sighted in the misty sky. Northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew, and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose. Less and less luminous grew the clouds, till at length Carter could see only blackness around him; but never did the winged steeds falter, bred as they were in earth\u2019s blackest crypts, and seeing not with any eyes, but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms. On and on they flew, past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import; ever in thickest darkness, and covering such prodigious spaces that Carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earth\u2019s dreamland."}

We crushed sleeping flowers with careless feet. We were maddened by the fear of unknown things. The attraction of the dead faces. We saw that the garden had no end under that moon. Where walls were by day, now there were only new views of trees and paths. There were flowers and shrubs, stone idols and pagodas. The yellow-lit stream wound past grassy banks and under strange marble bridges. The lips of the dead lotus faces whispered sadly. They told us to follow. We did not stpo walking.

The attendant felt a jolt of recognition when he saw the pair of symbols. These appeared often in recent notices from city office. Roughly speaking, they were the same. The symbols for \"Compact Vehilce\". \"Oversized Hauler\" headed them, just like in the sueprintendent's memos. But the sizes were quite different from modern rules. It was as if the original architect calculated space differently. As if later laws had created stricter. More refined versions of the space rules. The attendant tried to match the painted version with the one stuck in his head. He found it difficult. The rule he memorized started with \"Seven feet in width, ten in length\".

They are not even in the style of that last panicked note to Henderson. Instead, they are odd and repetitive. It is as if the beraking of the sender's good sense released a flood of habits.

No man who took part in that terrible raid would ever talk about it. Any surviving vageu information comes from people not in the final fighting group. It is frightening how carefully these raiders destroyed every scrap that mentioned the matte.r Eight sailors were killed. Their bodies were not shown. Their families accepted the story of a clash with customs ofifcers. The same story explained the many wounds. All wounds were heavily bandaged. Only Dr. Jabez Bowen treated them. He was with the group. It was hard to explain the strange smell on all the raiders. People discussed this smell for weeks. Among the citizen leaders, Capt, Whipple, and Moses Brown were hurt the worst. Their wives' letters show confusion caused by their silence and hidden bandages. Psychologically every participant was older, more serious, and shaken. It was good they were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religious people. If they had been more thoughtful or complex, they would have suffered more. President Manning was the most upset. But even he got over the worst of it. He buried memories in prayer. Each of those leaders later played an active role in important events. This was probably good. Little more than a year later Capt. Whipple led the crowd that burned the revenue ship Gaspee. In this bold act, the writer may see one step in erasing bad images.\n###\nNot one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Capt. Whipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced. Psychologically every participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt. Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images."}

Three hours latre, a short message said the flight started again into a harsh, cold wind. When a protest message was sent about more dangers, Lake replied briefly. He said his new samples made any risk worthwhile. It was seen that his excitement had reached a point of rebellion. Nothing could be done to stop this reckless risk to the whole epxedition's success. But it was terrible to think of going deeper into that dangerous white vastness. This area had storms and unknown mysteries.

He had turned restlessly several times in the last part of the first hour. But now his breathing showed unusual unevenness. There was an occasional sigh that sounded much like a choking moan. An electric flashlight was pointed at him. His face was seen to be turned away. After getting up. Walking to the othre side of the cot, the light was shone again to see if he seemed to be in pain. What was seen proved very upsetting, which was surprising given how minor it was. It must have been just linking any strange event with the evil feel of the place. The event itself was surely not scary or unnatural. It was simply that the sleeper's facial expression showed much distress. It was no doubt disturbed by the strange dreams caused by the situation. It did not seem like him at all. His usual look was one of kind and polite calm. But now many different emotions seemed to be fighting inside him. One thinks, overall, it was this mix of emtoions that mainly bothered the observer. The uncle gasped and tossed with growing upset. His eyes were now open. He seemed not like one man but many men. He gave a strange impression of benig separate from himself.\n###\nThen the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity, occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan. I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted, so rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the light to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality. It must have been merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in itself frightful or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle\u2019s facial expression, disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our situation prompted, betrayed considerable agitation, and seemed not at all characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly and well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling within him. I think, on the whole, that it was this variety which chiefly disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing perturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one but many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself."}

Then the cat jumped up violently from his sleepy spot. I saw him in the weak electric His head was stretched forward. His front feet were on a pile of thrown-away clothes. His back feet were stretchde out behind. He was staring at a spot on the closet wall to the east of the door. To my eeys, that spot had nothing special about it. But now all my attention was aimed at it. As I watched, I knew the animal was not excited for no reason. I cannot say for sure if the hanging coat actually moved. I think it did, just a What I can promise is that behind it I heard a clear rustling sound. It was like moving cloth or settling duts. A moment later, the cat jumped with his whole body onto the coat that was hiding the spot. His weight pulled that part of the coat to the floor. This showed a damp, forgotten corner of the closet. It was marked in places by moths and time. It had no sign of any physical disturbance. The cat ran up and down the floro by this part of the wall. He clawed at the fallen clothing. He seemed to try sometimes to push paw between the bottom board. The oak floor. He found nothing. He went back tiredly to his spot on top of messy pile. I had not moved. I did not go back to my work again for the rest of that hour.\n###\nAt some time I must have fallen into a placid reverie, for I recall a distinct sense of leaving mundane thoughts, when the cat started violently from his somnolent position. I saw him in the wan electric glow, head strained forward, fore feet on a pile of discarded garments, and hind feet stretched behind. He was looking intensely at a point on the closet wall somewhat east of the door, a point which to my eye had nothing to mark it, but toward which all my attention was now directed. And as I watched, I knew that the creature was not vainly excited. Whether the hanging coat actually moved I cannot say. I think it did, very slightly. But what I can swear to is that behind it I heard a low, distinct rustling as of shifting fabric or settling dust. In a moment the cat had jumped bodily on the screening garment, bringing the affected section to the floor with his weight, and exposing a damp, forgotten corner of the closet; patched here and there by moth and time, and devoid of any trace of material disturbance. The feline raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall, clawing the fallen raiment and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw between the baseboard and the oaken floor. He found nothing, and after a time returned wearily to his place atop the disordered heap. I had not moved, but I did not resume my task again that hour."}

I thought for a moment that this was the time I had heard Zann play the work of another composer. and, wilder and wilder, rose the shrieking and whining of that violin. The player was with a sweat. He twisted like a monkey. He looked at the curtained window. In his music, I could see satyrs. Whirling through boiling depths of clouds. I thought I heard a, note. It was not from the violin. It was a,,, mocking note from in the west. At this point, the shutter began to rattle. A howling night wind had sprung up. It seemed to answer the playing. Zann 's screaming violin surpassed itself. It emitted sounds I thought a violin could emit. The shutter rattled. It became. It began slamming against the window. the glass broke into pieces under the hits. The wind rushed. It made the candles sputter. It rustled the sheets of paper on the table. Zann had begun to write out his secret on taht table. I looked at Zann. I saw he was past observation. His eyes were bulging, glassy, and sightless. The playing had become a,, orgy. No pen could suggest it. A gust, than the others, caught the manuscript. It carried it toward the window. I followed the flying sheets in desperation. But they were gone before I reached the windowpanes. I rememberde my wish to look from this window. It was the window in the Rue d'Auseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall. One might see the city spread out beneath. It was. But the city 's lights burned. I expected to see them amidst the rain and wind. When I looked from that of all windows, I looked. The candles sputtered. The violin howled with the night wind. I saw no city spread. I saw no lights shining from streets. I saw the blackness of space. It was space, with motion and music. It had no resemblance to anything on earth.\n###\nI recognised the air\u2014it was a wild Hungarian dance popular in the theatres, and I reflected for a moment that this was the first time I had ever heard Zann play the work of another composer. Louder and louder, wilder and wilder, mounted the shrieking and whining of that desperate viol. The player was dripping with an uncanny perspiration and twisted like a monkey, always looking frantically at the curtained window. In his frenzied strains I could almost see shadowy satyrs and Bacchanals dancing and whirling insanely through seething abysses of clouds and smoke and lightning. And then I thought I heard a shriller, steadier note that was not from the viol; a calm, deliberate, purposeful, mocking note from far away in the west. At this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling night-wind which had sprung up outside as if in answer to the mad playing within. Zann\u2019s screaming viol now outdid itself, emitting sounds I had never thought a viol could emit. The shutter rattled more loudly, unfastened, and commenced slamming against the window. Then the glass broke shiveringly under the persistent impacts, and the chill wind rushed in, making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the table where Zann had begun to write out his horrible secret. I looked at Zann, and saw that he was past conscious observation. His blue eyes were bulging, glassy, and sightless, and the frantic playing had become a blind, mechanical, unrecognisable orgy that no pen could even suggest. A sudden gust, stronger than the others, caught up the manuscript and bore it toward the window. I followed the flying sheets in desperation, but they were gone before I reached the demolished panes. Then I remembered my old wish to gaze from this window, the only window in the Rue d\u2019Auseil from which one might see the slope beyond the wall, and the city outspread beneath. It was very dark, but the city\u2019s lights always burned, and I expected to see them there amidst the rain and wind. Yet when I looked from that highest of all gable windows, looked while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the night-wind, I saw no city spread below, and no friendly lights gleaming from remembered streets, but only the blackness of space illimitable; unimagined space alive with motion and music, and having no semblance to anything on earth."}

But none of the possible reasons for the body moving and rolling were reassuring. So, knowing how gugs act, the ghouls worked with a kind of frenzy. In a very short time, they lifted the door high enough to hold it still. While they held it, we turned the slab and made a wide opening. They then helped us through.

Crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft I felt reasonably safe, even though I knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away. I would be able to see them, but they could not, except by a malign miracle, see me. All at once I began dreading to look at them as they passed. I saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by, and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space. They would perhaps be the worst of all Innsmouth types\u2014something one would not care to remember. The stench waxed overpowering, and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking, baying, and barking without the least suggestion of human speech. Were these indeed the voices of my pursuers? Did they have dogs after all? So far I had seen none of the lower animals in Innsmouth. That flopping or pattering was monstrous\u2014I could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it. I would keep my eyes shut till the sounds receded toward the west. The horde was very close now\u2014the air foul with their hoarse snarlings, and the ground almost shaking with their alien-rhythmed footfalls. My breath nearly ceased to come, and I put every ounce of will power into the task of holding my eyelids down. I am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination. The later action of the government, after my frantic appeals, would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth; but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the quasi-hypnotic spell of that ancient, haunted, and shadowed town? Such places have strange properties, and the legacy of insane legend might well have acted on more than one human imagination amidst those dead, stench-cursed streets and huddles of rotting roofs and crumbling steeples. Is it not possible that the germ of an actual contagious madness lurks in the depths of that shadow over Innsmouth? Who can be sure of reality after hearing things like the tale of old Zadok Allen? The government men never found poor Zadok, and have no conjectures to make as to what became of him. Where does madness leave off and reality begin?"}

These were areas with highly abstract elements. They were areas with a strong presence of THE basic, general drives shared by all living things. A few more likenesses came from conscious copying. The Great Race explored the future and copied what it liked. Government was highly mechanized. It required extremely little time from eachh ciitzen. The larrge amount of free time was filled WITH various mental and artistic activities. The sciences reached an unbelievable level of development. Art was an important part of life. However, at the time of my dreams, it hhad passed its highest point. City planning was greatly pushed by the constant fight to survive. It was also pushed by the need to kepe the physical structures of great cities standing. this need was forced by the huge geological changes of those early days.\n###\nResemblances to human attitudes and institutions were, of course, most marked in those fields where on the one hand highly abstract elements were concerned, or where on the other hand there was a dominance of the basic, unspecialised urges common to all organic life. A few added likenesses came through conscious adoption as the Great Race probed the future and copied what it liked. Industry, highly mechanised, demanded but little time from each citizen; and the abundant leisure was filled with intellectual and aesthetic activities of various sorts. The sciences were carried to an unbelievable height of development, and art was a vital part of life, though at the period of my dreams it had passed its crest and meridian. Technology was enormously stimulated through the constant struggle to survive, and to keep in existence the physical fabric of great cities, imposed by the prodigious geologic upheavals of those primal days."}

The - shape that followed him. They, like him, had turned into strands of, glowing fog in this emptiness of darknes.s Something had gone aheadand he believed their movement was not in a line., they moved along the curves and spirals of some whirlpool. This whirlpool followed rules to the physics and math of any universe. there had been a suggestion of, jumping shadows. There was a, - pulsing, and the, whistling of an flute. But that was all. Gilman decided he had gotten that idea from what he read in the Necronomicon about the being Azathoth. This being rules all time. Space from a placed throne at the center of Chaos. After the blood was cleaned off, the wrist injury was. Gilman wondered about the spot of the two holes. He thought that there was no blood on the bedcover where he had been lying. This was because there was blood on his skin and sleeve. Had he been walking in his sleep in his room? Had the rat bitten him. He sat in a chair. Stood in some position? He looked in all corners for drops or marks but found none. He thought he should spread flour inside the room as outside the door. But, no proof of his sleepwalking was needed. He knew he did walk. he must stop it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help. This morning the pulls from space seemed. But they were repalced by another feeling to explain. It was a, wish to flee from his situation. But it gave no hint of the direction he wanted to go. When he lifted the - pointed object on the table, he thought the pull toward the north grew a. But, it was overcome by the and desire. He carried the - object down to Elwood \u2019s room. He prepared himself against the crying sounds of the repairman that rose from the floor.\n###\nHe had been taken there by the bubble-congeries and the little polyhedron which always dogged him; but they, like himself, had changed to wisps of milky, barely luminous mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness. Something else had gone on ahead\u2014a larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of form\u2014and he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line, but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos. Eventually there had been a hint of vast, leaping shadows, of a monstrous, half-acoustic pulsing, and of the thin, monotonous piping of an unseen flute\u2014but that was all. Gilman decided he had picked up that last conception from what he had read in the Necronomicon about the mindless entity Azathoth, which rules all time and space from a curiously environed black throne at the centre of Chaos. When the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight, and Gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures. It occurred to him that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had lain\u2014which was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and cuff. Had he been sleep-walking within his room, and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position? He looked in every corner for brownish drops or stains, but did not find any. He had better, he thought, sprinkle flour within the room as well as outside the door\u2014though after all no further proof of his sleep-walking was needed. He knew he did walk\u2014and the thing to do now was to stop it. He must ask Frank Elwood for help. This morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened, though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable. It was a vague, insistent impulse to fly away from his present situation, but held not a hint of the specific direction in which he wished to fly. As he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a trifle stronger; but even so, it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urge. He took the spiky image down to Elwood\u2019s room, steeling himself against the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor."}

Our grandmother's family was something that local people found interesting. Mr. Peabody said there was a lot of talk about her father's marriage. Her father was Benjamin Orne. The marriage happened just after the Civil War. People were puzzled about the bride's family background. The birde was an orphan from Hampshire. She was a cousin of the Essex County Masrhes. She was educated in France and knew about her own family. A guardian put money in a Boston bank. This money was for her and her French governess. People in Arkham did not know the guardian's name.

The night had no wind. The pale sand went up and down like frozen sea waves. The observer had no goal. But he moved forward as if sure of his fate. His dreams mixed with being awake. Each big stone in the sand seemed part of endless rooms and halls. They were made by beings before humans. They were carved with symbols he knew well from years as a captive mind of the Great Race. At times he thought he saw those all-knowing cone-shaped horrors doing their usual tasks. He feared to look down in case he looked like them. But he still saw the sand-covered blocks and the rooms and halls. He saw the evil, bright moon and the lamps of glowing crystal.

One notes that the problem was not the pile. Something about the dust on the flat floor. In the torch the dust did not look as smooth as it should. There were spots where it seemed thinner, as if it had been moved not many months ago. Certainty was impossible, because even the spost that looked thinner still had enough dust. But a feeling that the imagined roughness had a pattern was very disturbing. When the torch was moved close to one of the spots, what was seen was not liked. The sense of a pattern became very strong. It was like there were neat lines of grouped marks. The marks came in sets of three. Each set was a over a foot square. Each set had five nearly round prints, each three inches across. One print was in front of the other four.\n###\nNot the heap, but something about the dust of the level floor was troubling me.

I could not be sure, for even the apparently thinner places were dusty enough; yet a certain suspicion of regularity in the fancied unevenness was highly disquieting.

It was as if there were regular lines of composite impressions\u2014impressions that went in threes, each slightly over a foot square, and consisting of five nearly circular three-inch prints, one in advance of the other four."}

Finally, a very tired feeling without sleepiness is felt. The newly fixed hall door is locked. The light is turned off. The person lies down on the hard, uneven bed with coat, collar. Shoes still on. In the dark, every small night noise seems louder. Many very unpleasant thoughts come to the person. They regret turning off the light. But they are too tired to get up and turn it on again.

The that had held me was now only a memory with teeth. It tried weakly to wiggle across the tiled floor toward me. It sometimes let out weak puffs of icy spite. Now fast and sharp waves attacked the freezing air. I saw the gleam of a dryer's round window as it cut through the numbing gloom. I did not move, for I could not. I watched dizzily as the door closed to let in a huge, shapeless flow of heated material. It was dotted with shining, one-eyed machines. It poured thickly, like a flood of steam bursting a frozen pipe. It knocked oevr a laundry basket as it spread. Finally it flowed under the folding tables and across the room. It went to where the numb form with the chattering teeth still hid. Around that form it closed, completely swallowing it up. A mometn later it began to plul back. It carried away its unseen load without bothering me. It flowed again out of that humming inside space and down ordinary street.

It poured thickly, like a flood of steam bursting a frozen pipe, overturned a laundry basket as it spread, and finally flowed under the folding tables and across the room to where the benumbed form with the chattering teeth still cowered. Around that form it closed, totally swallowing it up, and in another moment it had begun to recede; bearing away its invisible burden without disturbing me, and flowing again out of that humming interior and down the mundane street, which groaned as before, though in reverse order."}

Anyhow, he succeeds in making outcomes that differ frmo the faker's plain, unmemorable products.

For the winged fungus-beings to carry the brain-cylinders intact through space was an easy matter.

It was the plant life. All the orchard trees bloomed in colors. Through the soil of the yard and pasture, a growth sprang up. a botanist could link it to the plants of the area. No, colors were seen except in the grass and leaves. But there were and rainbow - versions of some, color. This color had no place aomng the known shades of earth. The Dutchman \u2019s breeches became a thing of threat. The bloodroots grew in their colors. Ammi and the Gardners thought colors seemed. They decided the colors reminded them of the globule in the meteor. Nahum plowed and sowed the ten - acre pasture and the upland field. But he did nothing with the land around the house. He knew it would be. He hoped the summer \u2019s growths would draw all the poison from the soil. He was for anything. He had grown used to the feeling of something near him waiting to be heard.

All the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth. The Dutchman\u2019s breeches became a thing of sinister menace, and the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the Gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity, and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor. Nahum ploughed and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the upland lot, but did nothing with the land around the house. He knew it would be of no use, and hoped that the summer\u2019s strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for almost anything now, and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to be heard. The shunning of his house by neighbours told on him, of course; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being at school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the gossip. Thaddeus, an especially sensitive youth, suffered the most. In May the insects came, and Nahum\u2019s place became a nightmare of buzzing and crawling. Most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and motions, and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience. The Gardners took to watching at night\u2014watching in all directions at random for something . . . they could not tell what. It was then that they all owned that Thaddeus had been right about the trees. Mrs. Gardner was the next to see it from the window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky. The boughs surely moved, and there was no wind. It must be the sap. Strangeness had come into everything growing now. Yet it was none of Nahum\u2019s family at all who made the next discovery. Familiarity had dulled them, and what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from Bolton who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends."}

Surely the end was near. The hiding place was discovered. The goal of the night trips was revealed. The man did not speak to the observer.

The sleepy eyes were fixed on the crack where the padlocked door was partly open. By what miracle had the watcher been fooled? It became clear that a supernatural force offered proetction. Made made bold by this lucky event, a return to open visits to the valut was begun. One was sure no witness to the entrance could be found. For a week, the josy of that tomb gathering, which must not be described, were fluly enjoyed. Then thing happened. A move to this cursed place of sorrow.

Imagine my delighted astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent in a cautious whisper that I had spent the night in the bower outside the tomb; my sleep-filmed eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal stood ajar! By what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded? I was now convinced that a supernatural agency protected me. Made bold by this heaven-sent circumstance, I began to resume perfect openness in going to the vault; confident that no one could witness my entrance. For a week I tasted to the full the joys of that charnel conviviality which I must not describe, when the thing happened, and I was borne away to this accursed abode of sorrow and monotony."}

Soon after, the observer quickly filled the burned-out lamps. He used an oil supply he had seen earlier. When the room was bright again, he looked around. He wanted to find a lantern for more exploration. He was filled with horror. But his serious purpose was still strongest. He was firmly decided to search completely. He wanted to find the horrible facts behind Charles Ward's strange madness. Failing to find a lantern, he picked the smallest lamp to carry. He also filled his pockets with candles and matches. He took a gallon can of oil. He planned to save it for later use. He might find a hidden laboratory beyond the terrible open area. That area had an unclean altar and covered wells with no names. Crossing that area again would need all his courage. But he knew he had to do it. Fortunatley neither the frightening altar nor the open shaft was near the large wall.

I felt around for the wicker edge. I wanted to measure for the firts time the full amount. I wanted to measure the damp, tangled masses I had been warned about. But on every side, I was confused. All I found were huge piles of fabric. They held disgusting, shapeless bundles of disturbing heaviness. More and more I thought. I wondered what ancient secrets might live in this swollen container. It had been so many cycles cut off from the cleaning rituals below. Then unexpectedly my hadns found the twin handles. A braid of plastic hung there, rough with strange texture. Seizing them, I fonud them tight. But with greta burst of strength, I beat all resistance. I pulled the basket up form the floor. As I did this, the purest fear I have ever known came to me. Pressing relentlessly on my aching arms was a colossal, smothering weight. It pressed down the short, carpeted hallway that rose from the laundry room door. I had never felt this weight before except in dreams. I had felt it in vague feelings I did not dare call prophecies.\n###\nBelieving I was now at a prodigious burden, far beyond the common heft of a half-filled hamper, I dragged myself up from the chair and fumbled about for the wicker rim, that I might gauge for the first time the full measure, and the damp, tangled masses of which I had been warned. But on every hand I was confounded; since all that I found were vast accumulations of fabric, bearing odious, amorphous bundles of disturbing density. More and more I reflected, and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this swollen receptacle so many cycles cut off from the cleansing rites below. Then unexpectedly my hands came upon the twin handles, where hung a plait of plastic, rough with strange texturing. Seizing them, I found them strained; but with a supreme burst of strength I overcame all resistance and dragged the basket upward from the floor. As I did so there came to me the purest dread I have ever known; for pressing inexorably upon my aching arms, and down the short, carpeted passageway that ascended from the laundry room threshold, was the colossal, suffocating weight, which I had never before felt save in dreams and in vague premonitions I dared not call prophecies."}

The observer found the corridor again past the huge pile of rubble and stones. After a distance, he came to a completely blocked place. The fallen ceiling almost touched the dangerously sagging roof above. He does not know how he moved enough blocks to create a passage. He does not know how he dared to disturb the tightly packed fragments. The smallest change in balance could have brought down tons of stone above to crush him. Sheer madness drove and guided him. That is, if his entire underground adventure was not a hellish delusion. A dream, as he hopes. He did make a passage. Dream he made one, that he could squeeze through.

I knew the methods of Harold Warren well. I even used some of them myself. I have finished all the Complex tax forms from his huge collection that are written in codes I understand. But these are few compared to the forms written in rules I cnanot understand. I believe most are in the feared language of the Internal Revenue. The document thta announced the final audit was in his briefcase whne he went into the audit. It was written in deductions I have never seen anywhere else. Warren would never tell me exactly what that document claimed. About our tax returns, must I say again that I no longer fully unedrstand them? It seems kind that I do not, because they were awful calculations. I did them more because I had to, not becasue I wanted to. Warren always controlled me in these matters. Sometimes I was afraid of his extreme attention to detail. I remember how I shook at his excited look on the nihgt before the deadline. He talked constantly about his theory. He said why some deductions never die. They stay valid and powerful in their account books for a thousand tax years. But I do not fear his close examination now. I think he has known audits beyond my understanding. Now I fear for his mental health.\n###\nAs I have said before, the arcane procedures of Harold Warren were well known to me, and to some extent shared by me. Of his vast accumulation of strange, complex forms pertaining to fiscal obligations I have completed all that are composed in the codes of which I am master; but these are few as compared with those in regulations I cannot comprehend. Most, I believe, are in the dread dialect of the Internal Revenue; and the fiend-conceived document which heralded the final reckoning\u2014the document which he bore in his briefcase into the abyss of the audit\u2014was inscribed in deductions whose like I never saw elsewhere. Warren would never tell me just what was claimed upon that document. As to the nature of our submissions\u2014must I say again that I no longer retain full comprehension? It seems to me rather merciful that I do not, for they were terrible calculations, which I pursued more through reluctant obligation than through actual inclination. Warren always dominated me in these matters, and sometimes I feared his meticulousness. I remember how I shuddered at his feverish expression on the night before the awful deadline, when he talked so incessantly of his theory, why certain deductions never perish, but remain valid and potent within their ledgers for a thousand fiscal years. But I do not fear his scrutiny now, for I suspect that he has known audits beyond my ken. Now I fear for his sanity."}

He had been, even without clear reason, naturally on guard. That helped him in the and real problem, whatveer it might be. Still, the change of the threat from a vague feeling to a real thing was a shock. It hit him like a real hit. It never once came to his mind that the trying of the lock might be a mistake.

Nevertheless the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock, and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow.

The smells that sometimes came from the lab were also very Sometimes they were very But more often they were pleasant and aromatic. They had a haunting, hard-to-catch quality that seemed to cause fantastic images. People who smelled them tended to see brief mirages of huge views. They saw hills or endless rows of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching far away. Ward did not go back to his walks. Instead, he worked on the books he brought home. He also did studies in his rooms. He explained that European sources had greatly expanded his work's possibilities. He promised discoveries in the coming years. His older appearance increased his likeness to the Curwen portrait in his library. Dr. Willett would often stop by the portrait after a visit. He marevled at how identical they looked. He thought only the pit above the picture's right eye now separated the long-dead wizard from the living youth. Thsee visits by Willett were done at the request of the senior Wards. They were curious events. Ward never turned the doctor away. But the doctor saw he could never understand the man's inner thoughts. Frequently the doctor noted things about. There were wax figures of design on shelves or tablse. There were partly erased remains of circles, triangles. Pentagrams in chalk. Charcoal on the cleared floor of the room. And always at night those rhythms and chants thundered. It beacme very to keep servants or stop secret talk about Charles's madness.\n###\nThe odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the picture\u2019s right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willett\u2019s, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young man\u2019s inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room.

Sanity was gone. I ignored everything except the [THING] urge to run. I just fought and pushed upward over the rubble on the slope. I acted as if the deep crack did not exist. Then I saw the edge of the chasm. I leaped wildly with all my strength. I was instantly swallowed by a hellish whirlpool of hateful sound. Complete, physically solid blackness. This is the end of my experience, as far as I can remember. Any further feelings belong completely to the world of chaotic delirium. Dream, insanity, and memory mixed together wildly. They formed a series of strange, broken illusions. These can have no connection to anything real. There was a terrible fall through countless miles of thick, aware darkness. There was a confusion of noises completely foreign to all we know of Earth. Its organic life. Dormant, basic senses seemed to come alive in me. They told of pits and empty spaces filled with floating horrors. They led to sunlses cliffs and oceans and crowded cities. These cities had windolwess basalt towers where no light ever shone. Secrets of the original planet and its ancient ages flashed through my brain. This happened without the help of sight or sound. I knew things that not even the wildest of my past dreams had ever hinted at. All the while, cold fingers of dapm mist grabbed and pulled at me. That weird, damnable whistling screamed wickedly above all the changes between noise and silence. This happened in the whirlpools of darkness around me. Afterward there were visions of the Cyclopean [THING] from my dreams. It was not in ruins. It was just as I had dreamed it. I was in my cone - shaped, non - human [THING] again. I mixed with crowds of the Great Race and the captured minds. They carried books up and down the high corridors and wide slopes. Then, over these pictures, came frightening, brief flashes of a non - visual awareness. This involved desperate struggles. It involved twisting free from grabbing tentacles of whistling [THING]. It involved an insane, bat - like flight through half - solid air. It involved a feverish digging through the cyclone - beaten dark. It involved a wild stumbling and climbing over fallen stonework. Once there was a strange, intrusive flash of half - vision. It was a faint, spread - out hint of bluish light far above. Then came a deram of climbing and crawling pursued by [THING]. It involved squeezing into a glare of mocking moonlight. This was through a pile of wreckage that slid. Fell behind me in a sickly hurricane.\n###\nNow, indeed, the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity departed\u2014and ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline\u2019s debris as if no gulf had existed. Then I saw the chasm\u2019s edge, leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength I possessed, and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniac vortex of loathsome sound and utter, materially tangible blackness. This is the end of my experience, so far as I can recall. Any further impressions belong wholly to the domain of phantasmagoric delirium. Dream, madness, and memory merged wildly together in a series of fantastic, fragmentary delusions which can have no relation to anything real. There was a hideous fall through incalculable leagues of viscous, sentient darkness, and a babel of noises utterly alien to all that we know of the earth and its organic life. Dormant, rudimentary senses seemed to start into vitality within me, telling of pits and voids peopled by floating horrors and leading to sunless crags and oceans and teeming cities of windowless basalt towers upon which no light ever shone. Secrets of the primal planet and its immemorial aeons flashed through my brain without the aid of sight or sound, and there were known to me things which not even the wildest of my former dreams had ever suggested. And all the while cold fingers of damp vapour clutched and picked at me, and that eldritch, damnable whistling shrieked fiendishly above all the alternations of babel and silence in the whirlpools of darkness around. Afterward there were visions of the Cyclopean city of my dreams\u2014not in ruins, but just as I had dreamed of it. I was in my conical, non-human body again, and mingled with crowds of the Great Race and the captive minds who carried books up and down the lofty corridors and vast inclines. Then, superimposed upon these pictures, were frightful momentary flashes of a non-visual consciousness involving desperate struggles, a writhing free from clutching tentacles of whistling wind, an insane, bat-like flight through half-solid air, a feverish burrowing through the cyclone-whipped dark, and a wild stumbling and scrambling over fallen masonry. Once there was a curious, intrusive flash of half-sight\u2014a faint, diffuse suspicion of bluish radiance far overhead. Then there came a dream of wind-pursued climbing and crawling\u2014of wriggling into a blaze of sardonic moonlight through a jumble of debris which slid and collapsed after me amidst a morbid hurricane."}

Even the slaves had chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them silent. were the struggles of those jelly-like monsters as the mocking night-gaunts held them. But nothing worked against the strength of those black gripping claws. When a moon-beast struggled too a night-gaunt would grab. Pull its shaking pink tentacles. This seemed to hurt so much that the victim would stop struggling. The observer expected to see much killing. But he found that the ghouls had much more subtle plans. They gave certain simple orders to the night-gaunts holding the captives. They trusted the rest to instinct. Soon the unlucky creatures were carried silently away into the Abyss. They were to be given equally to the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dwellers. These beings feed in ways that are not painless for their chosen victims. Meanwhile, the three tied ghouls were freed and comforted by their winning relatives. Various groups searched the area for any possible remaining moon-beasts. They went onto the bad-smelling black ship at the dock to make sure nothing had escaped the general defeat. Surely enough, the capture was complete. The winners could find no sign of further life. The observer wanted to keep a way to reach the rest of dreamland. He asked them not to sink the anchored ship.

The moon-beasts, of course, were voiceless; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence. Horrible were the writhings of those great jellyish abnormalities as the sardonic night-gaunts clutched them, but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons. When a moon-beast writhed too violently, a night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles. Carter expected to see much slaughter, but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans. They glibbered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts which held the captives, trusting the rest to instinct; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the Great Abyss, to be distributed impartially amongst the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims. Meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk, whilst various parties searched the neighbourhood for possible remaining moon-beasts, and boarded the evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat. Surely enough, the capture had been thorough; for not a sign of further life could the victors detect. Carter, anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland, urged them not to sink the anchored galley; and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio.

It was impossible to guess how large an area had been opened up without trying. The different buildings were closely and often connected. This made it likely one could cross from one to another on bridges under the ice. This would be except where blocked by local collapses and earth cracks. Very little ice seemed to have gotten into the big structures. Almost All the clear ice areas showed the underwater windows were tightly closed. It was as if the town had been left in that same state until the ice sheet came to freeze the lower part for all future time. Indeed, a strange feeling is gotten that this place had been purposely shut. Left empty in some distant, past age. It was not destroyed by any sudden disaster or even slow ruin. Had Had the coming of the ice been expected? Had an unknown people all left together to find a less doomed home? The exact land conditions when the ice sheet formed here would have to be solved later. It had very clearly not been a crushing movement. Maybe the weight of piled-up snow was the cause. Maybe some flood from the river. From an ancient ice dam breaking in the great mountain range, helped create the special state seen now. Imagination can imagine almost anything about this place.\n###\nJust how extensive a territory we had opened up, it was impossible to guess without a trial. The close and frequent connexion of the different buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts, for very little glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions. Almost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered, as if the town had been left in that uniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallise the lower part for all succeeding time. Indeed, one gained a curious impression that this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim, bygone aeon, rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even gradual decay. Had the coming of the ice been foreseen, and had a nameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode? The precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the ice-sheet at this point would have to wait for later solution. It had not, very plainly, been a grinding drive. Perhaps the pressure of accumulated snows had been responsible; and perhaps some flood from the river, or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the great range, had helped to create the special state now observable. Imagination could conceive almost anything in connexion with this place."}

Routine during the night. My night routine must have usde a strict method. This was because the number of steps was large. The items were spread all over the bathroom cabinet. Hree was a single washing at the sink. A tired person had put on the paste after a long yaw.n Here also was a wandering note on the mirror. A careful person describes an exact method from pictures he has studied. A note from the dentist says a fluoride treatment is of top importance. This is for some \"cavity-free forever\" that never really comes. Meanwhile, instructions from the box speak carefully of serious tooth wear near the end of the brushing time. Tartar build-ups grow in the hidden cracks, and back teteh tell of worrying feelings. Household people in the next rooms find certain sound waves annoying around this time. Porcelain surfaces are covered by random drops on the night of especially strong sessions. The medicine cabinet is aslo full of strange liquids and creams. A very neat cleaner named Phillips shows a strnage \"Plaque Revelation Tablet\" at the suburban show in 1926. There are so many written wranings in tooth magazines. Only a miracle could have stopped regular people from seeing odd connections. Making confused guesses. A strange set of objects, all in all. I can now hardly imagine the codl carelessness with which I once ignored them. I was then sure that the night bursh had known about the older build-ups the gum doctor talked about.\n###\nThe dental implements, as I have intimated, pertained to rituals of hygiene, somnolence, and regularity during the evening hours. My nocturnal regimen must have employed a strict methodology, for the number of steps was considerable and the sources scattered throughout the bathroom cabinet. Here was a solitary ablution at the sink, where a weary occupant had applied the paste after a protracted yawn.

Household members in the adjacent rooms find certain sonic vibrations bothersome about this time, and porcelain surfaces are strewn by erratic spatters on the night of particularly vigorous sessions. The medicine cabinet, too, is full of strange potions and unguents, and a fastidious hygienist named Phillips displays a bizarre \u201cPlaque Revelation Tablet\u201d in the suburban exhibition of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded admonitions in dental periodicals, that only a miracle can have stopped the common populace from noting strange correlations and drawing mystified conclusions. A peculiar array of artifacts, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous neglect with which I once set them aside.

Everyone should know that Cf. Wrote this work. On the other hand, Ibid's great work was the famous *Op. Cit*. In it, all the important hidden themes of Graeco-Roman expression were perfectly captured forever. This was done with great sharpness, even though Ibid wroet at a surprisingly late time. There is a false story. This story is often repeated in modern books before Von Schweinkopf's major work *Geschichte der Ostrogothen in Italien*. The story says Ibid was a Romanised Visigoth from Ataulf's group. Tihs group settled in Placentia around 410 A.D. The opposite truth must be stressed very strongly. B\u00eatenoir2, have proven without doubt that this very unique person was a real Roman. At least, he was as real a Roman as that weak. Mixed-up time could create. About him, one could say what Gibbon sadi about Boethius: \"he was the last person whom Cato. Tully could have called their fellow countryman.\" It is noted that he was, like Boethius. Almost all important men of his time, from the great Anician family. He traced his family line very precisely. Proudly back to all the heroes of the Roman republic. His full name was long and showy. This followed the custom of a time that had lost the simple three-name style of classic Roman naming. Von Schweinkopf3 says his full name was Caius Anicius Magnus Furius Camillus \u00c6milianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius Ibidus. However, Littlewit4 dose not accept \u00c6milianus and adds Claudius Decius Junianus. Meanwhile, B\u00eatenoir5 has a very different view. He gives the full name as Magnus Furius Camillus Aurelius Antoninus Flavius Anicius Petronius Valentinianus Aegidus Ibidus.\n###\nThe erroneous idea that Ibid is the author of the Lives is so frequently met with, even among those pretending to a degree of culture, that it is worth correcting. It should be a matter of general knowledge that Cf. is responsible for this work. Ibid\u2019s masterpiece, on the other hand, was the famous Op. Cit. wherein all the significant undercurrents of Graeco-Roman expression were crystallised once for all\u2014and with admirable acuteness, notwithstanding the surprisingly late date at which Ibid wrote. There is a false report\u2014very commonly reproduced in modern books prior to Von Schweinkopf\u2019s monumental Geschichte der Ostrogothen in Italien\u2014that Ibid was a Romanised Visigoth of Ataulf\u2019s horde who settled in Placentia about 410 A.D. The contrary cannot be too strongly emphasised; for Von Schweinkopf, and since his time Littlewit1 and B\u00eatenoir,2 have shewn with irrefutable force that this strikingly isolated figure was a genuine Roman\u2014or at least as genuine a Roman as that degenerate and mongrelised age could produce\u2014of whom one might well say what Gibbon said of Boethius, \u201cthat he was the last whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman.\u201d He was, like Boethius and nearly all the eminent men of his age, of the great Anician family, and traced his genealogy with much exactitude and self-satisfaction to all the heroes of the republic. His full name\u2014long and pompous according to the custom of an age which had lost the trinomial simplicity of classic Roman nomenclature\u2014is stated by Von Schweinkopf3 to have been Caius Anicius Magnus Furius Camillus \u00c6milianus Cornelius Valerius Pompeius Julius Ibidus; though Littlewit4 rejects \u00c6milianus and adds Claudius Decius Junianus; whilst B\u00eatenoir5 differs radically, giving the full name as Magnus Furius Camillus Aurelius Antoninus Flavius Anicius Petronius Valentinianus Aegidus Ibidus."}

They agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that nothing drastic need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as complete an ignorance as her son\u2019s own strange typed notes would permit. Mr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it wholly a surprise visit. Dr. Willett took him in his car one evening, guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return. The session was a long one, and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state. His reception had developed much like Willett\u2019s, save that Charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the Portuguese away with an imperative demand; and in the bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection. The lights had been dim, yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously. He had not spoken out loud at all, averring that his throat was in very poor condition; but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it from his mind. Now definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youth\u2019s mental salvation, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford. Pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied, and this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region. Dr. Willett obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure, and from all he heard he could tell that young Ward\u2019s life had become indeed a strange one. Common tongues would not dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer, while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculation. Local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the evil-looking mulatto, and in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighbourhood. For a household of only three, these quantities were quite absurd."}

Freed from my attack very quickly, I left the chilly place as a follower. Admirer of the gifted loner. After that, I often visited him wearing my coat. I listened while he spoke of secret studies and almost horrilbe results. I shook a little when I looked at the unusual. Very elderly books on his shelves. I may add, I was nearly cured of my sickness for good by his skilled care. It seems he did not reject the chants of the old healers. He believed these mysterious phrases held rare mind stimulants. These might have special effects on the substance of a nervous system from which organic pulses had gone. I was moved by his story of the old Dr. Torres of Valencia. This doctor had shared his earlier tests with himm duuring the great sickness eighteen years beofre. His current troubles came ffrom that time. No sooner had the respected doctor saved his partner than he himself fell to the grim enemy he had fought. Maybe the stress had been too muhc.

After that I paid him frequent overcoated calls; listening while he told of secret researches and almost ghastly results, and trembling a bit when I examined the unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his shelves. I was eventually, I may add, almost cured of my disease for all time by his skilful ministrations. It seems that he did not scorn the incantations of the mediaevalists, since he believed these cryptic formulae to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably have singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which organic pulsations had fled. I was touched by his account of the aged Dr. Torres of Valencia, who had shared his earlier experiments with him through the great illness of eighteen years before, whence his present disorders proceeded.

He said he must get it to Orne and Hutchinson at. when he seemed, the doctor told him this. He said that of those beings, at one was his enemy. That one had given Dr. Allen advice for his murder. This news showed no effect. Before it was given, the visitors could see their host had the look of a man. After that, he would talk. Willett and the father left. They left behind a warning about the Allen. To this, the youth replied that this person was handled. He said that person could harm no one if he wanted to. This was said with an laugh that was to hear. They did not worry about any letters Charles might write to that pair in Europe. They knew the hospital authorities took all mail for review. They would not allow any or - looking letter. There is a follow - up to the matter of Orne. Hutchinson, if those exiled wizards were them. Moved, by some feeling during that time, made a plan. He arranged with an press - cutting service for reports of crimes. Accidents in Prague. In Transylvania. After six months, he believed he had found two things among the items he received. One was the destruction of a house by night in the part of Prague. The man named Josef Nadek disappeared. He had lived for as anyone could remember. The was a explosion in the mountains of Rakus. The - regarded Castle Ferenczy was destroyed with all its people. Its master was spoken of by peasants and soldiers. He would have been called to Bucharest for questioning. But this event ended a career it predated all memory. Willett states that the hand which wrote those notes could use weapons. He says that. Curwen was left for him to handle, the writer felt to find. Deal with Orne. The doctor tries not to think about what their fate may have been.\n###\nIn reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr\u00e9-looking missive. There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think."}

Based on the carvings we used for our map, the wanted tunnel entrance could not be much more than a quarter-mile from our spot. The space between showed solid-looking buildings. These were quite likely still pasasble at a level under the ice. The opening itself would be in the basement. It would be on the side closest to the foothills.

No suhc building came TO mind whhen we thought back on our flight. So we decidded its upper parts were badly damaged. Or it was comppletely broken in an ice crack we had seen. In that case, the tunnel would likely be blocked. Then we would have to try the next closest one. That one was less than a mile to the north. The river in bteween sttopped us from trying any tunnels farther south on this trip.

In the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one\u2014the one less than a mile to the north.

By staring in a way at a fellow student, she would give that person a feeling of exchanged personality. It was as if the subject were placed in the magician 's body. They could stare across the room at her body. Its eyes blazed and bulged with an expression. Asenath made claims about the nature of consciousness. She claimed it was of the body\u2014. At from the life processes of the body., her anger was that she was not a man. She believed a brian had and - reaching powers. With a man 's brain, she declared, she could not match. Surpass her father in mastering forces. Edward met Asenath at a gathering of \" intellectuals \" held in one of the sutdents ' rooms. He could talk of nothing when he came to see me the day. He had found her of the interests and learning which absorbed him. He was taken with her appearance. I had seen the woman. I recalled, references. But I knew who she was. It seemed that Derby should become about her. But I said nothing to discourage him, since infatuation grows on opposition. He said he was not mentioning her to his father.

Asenath often made wild claims about the nature of consciousness and about its independence of the physical frame\u2014or at least from the life-processes of the physical frame. Her crowning rage, however, was that she was not a man; since she believed a male brain had certain unique and far-reaching cosmic powers. Given a man\u2019s brain, she declared, she could not only equal but surpass her father in mastery of unknown forces. Edward met Asenath at a gathering of \u201cintelligentsia\u201d held in one of the students\u2019 rooms, and could talk of nothing else when he came to see me the next day. He had found her full of the interests and erudition which engrossed him most, and was in addition wildly taken with her appearance. I had never seen the young woman, and recalled casual references only faintly, but I knew who she was. It seemed rather regrettable that Derby should become so upheaved about her; but I said nothing to discourage him, since infatuation thrives on opposition. He was not, he said, mentioning her to his father. In the next few weeks I heard of very little but Asenath from young Derby. Others now remarked Edward\u2019s autumnal gallantry, though they agreed that he did not look even nearly his actual age, or seem at all inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity. He was only a trifle paunchy despite his indolence and self-indulgence, and his face was absolutely without lines. Asenath, on the other hand, had the premature crow\u2019s feet which come from the exercise of an intense will. About this time Edward brought the girl to call on me, and I at once saw that his interest was by no means one-sided. She eyed him continually with an almost predatory air, and I perceived that their intimacy was beyond untangling. Soon afterward I had a visit from old Mr. Derby, whom I had always admired and respected. He had heard the tales of his son\u2019s new friendship, and had wormed the whole truth out of \u201cthe boy\u201d.

Around the first week in July, I developed a strange set of mixed feelings about that particular green-coated coil. There was disgust, and there was interest. But more than that, there was a lasting and confusing sense of knowing it. I tried all kinds of practical methods to remove these ideas from my mind. I had no success. Disquietude also increased for me. I almost welcomed this because it shortened my daily work. I got into the habit of taking long, solo looks at the garden late at night. I usually went to the shed. The tap, where the total of my strange new urges seemed to pull me subtly.\n###\nAround the first week in July I developed an unaccountable set of mixed sensations about that particular verdigrised coil. There was revulsion, and there was fascination\u2014but more than that, there was a persistent and perplexing illusion of familiarity. I tried all sorts of mechanical expedients to purge these notions from my mind, but met with no success. Disquietude also gained upon me, but I almost welcomed this because of the resultant shortening of my diurnal employments.

We learned all the details of his case from medical and court rceords. This man was a wanderer, hunter, and trapper. His simple companions always thought he was strange. He usually slept later than normal at night. When he woke, he often spoke of unknown thhings. His manner was so odd it scared even people who were not imaginative. His way of speaking was not unusual. He only used the rough local dialect of HIS surroundings. But the tone and content of his words weer mysteriously wild. No one could listen without feeling uneasy. He hhimself was usually as scared and confused as his listeners. Within an hour of waking, he would forget everything he had said. Or at least, he fforgot what made him say those things. He would return to slow, somewhat friendly normal state, like the oother hill people.\n###\nFrom the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case. This man, a vagabond, hunter, and trapper, had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates. He had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time, and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace. Not that his form of language was at all unusual, for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment; but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness, that none might listen without apprehension. He himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors, and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said, or at least all that had caused him to say what he did; relapsing into a bovine, half-amiable normality like that of the other hill-dwellers."}

The fear from the smlel and noise was overcome. The openings were checked one by one. Behind them, rooms with stone ribbed ceilings were found. Each room was medium-sized and seemed oddly used. Most had fireplaces. The upper parts of their chimneys would be interesting for engineering study. Such tools or hints of tools had nveer been seen before or after. They appeared everywhere under dust and webs from a century and a half. Many were clearly broken, as if by attackers long ago. Many rooms seemed untouched by modern people. They must have shown the first and oldest stages of Joseph Curwen's work. Finally a clearly modern room was found, or at least one used recently. There were oil heaters, bookshelves, tables, chairs, cabinets. A desk stacked high with papers of different ages. Candlesticks and oil lamps were in several spots. A match container was fonud nearby. The lamps thta were ready were lit.\n###\nOvercoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwen\u2019s experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, Willett lighted such as were ready for use."}

As a customer, my goal in getting the. -called \"Ultimate\" broadband package was only to get uninterrupted flows of data. Messages from different parts of the electronic air. This was helepd by the remarkable router made by our service provider's engineers. I did not want to be a pioneer in any other area. I did hope that using this mechanical device at different points along already set-up connections would show speeds of a kind never reached by normal home delivery methods. The provider's routing device, as the public already knows from their ads, was unique. Exrteme in its power, modernness. Ability to mix the normal ethernet idea with the dual-band wireless broadcast idea. It mixed them in a way to handle demands of different complexity qucikly. Plastic shell, internal antennas, multi-core proecssor, collapsibel external aerials, signal-boosting equipment, cabling, packet-filtering software. Sectional adapters for throughputs of many gigabits. Up to countless connected devices all formed, with needed extras, no bigger load than a single shelf could hold. This was possible because of the clever miniaturization used to make most of the silicon objects. Four separate networked appliances were designed especially for the huge data-loading needed for modern living. They had added heat-dissipation and quick-connection devices worked out by the technicians. In theory, they could move our whole household's digital trip from a base at the edge of the coaxial barrier to various suitable airy points. From these points, a enough share of bandwidth would serve us.\n###\nIt is further against us that we are not, in the strictest sense, adepts in the digital realms which came primarily to be concerned. As a subscriber my object in procuring the so-called \"Ultimate\" broadband package was wholly that of securing uninterrupted streams of data and missives from various parts of the electronic aether, aided by the remarkable router devised by the engineers of our service provider. I had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this; but I did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different nodes along previously established connections would bring to light speeds of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of domestic conveyance. The provider\u2019s routing apparatus, as the public already knows from their advertisements, was unique and radical in its potency, modernity, and capacity to combine the ordinary ethernet principle with the principle of the dual-band wireless broadcast in such a way as to cope quickly with demands of varying complexity.

I found that my own dental records had at least a small connection to the supposedly ended practice of Dr. Thorne. I was the last person in my family to go to the dentist. I was also the last of this older and more feared line of patients. I began to feel the time was right for me. I looked forward with a cold fear to the moment I might go through that shiny door. Down those clean, bright hallways under the harsh lights. I now started the habit of looking very carefully at the slightly open appointment book. I chose my most hated busy midday hours for this grim watch. By the time the month changed, I had made a small note in book on the page before the ink-stained schedule. I let the dates around it surround. Hang over the time slot like the walls. Roof of a bureaucratic tomb. This page was my statement. The confirmed time was my punishment.

Then the observer's uncle moving in his sleep attracted the observer's attention. He had turned restlessly on the cot several times in the last part of the first hour. But now he was breathing with unusual unevenness. Sometimes he let out a sigh that sounded much like a choking moan. The observer pointed his electric flashlight at him. He saw his face was turned away. So the observer got up and walked to the other side of the cot. He shone the light again to see if he seemed to be in pain. What the observer saw upset him very much, which was surprising given how minor it was. It must have been just linking any strange event with the evil feel of their place. The event itself was surely not scary or unnatural. It was simply that the observer's uncle's facial expression showed much distress. It was no doubt disturbed by the strange dreams caused by their situation. It did not seem like him at all. His usual look was one of kind and polite calm. But now many different emotions seemed to be fighting inside him. The observer thought, overall, it was tihs mix of emotions that mainly bothered him. His uncle gasped and tossed with growing upset. His eyes were now open. He seemed not like one man but many men. He gave a strange impression of being separate from himself.\n###\nThen the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity, occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan. I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted, so rising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed the light to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me most surprisingly, considering its relative triviality. It must have been merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in itself frightful or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle\u2019s facial expression, disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our situation prompted, betrayed considerable agitation, and seemed not at all characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly and well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling within him.

My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasing perturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one but many men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself."}

My knowledge of the thing started in the winter of 1926\u201327. It began with the death of my great-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brwon Universtiy, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor Angell was widely known as an expert on ancient writings. The heads of important museums often asked for his help. So many people may remember his death at age ninety-two. Local interest grew because the cause of death was unclear. Thhe professor had been struck while returning from the Newport boat. He fell suddenly, as witnesses spoke. This happened after a sailor-looking blackk man bumped into him. The man came from one of the odd dark allesy on the steep hillside. This path was a shortcut from the waterfront to the dead man's home in Williams Street. Doctors could not find any visiblle problem. But after confused discussion, they decided an unclear heart injury was the cause. They thought the fast climb up such a steep hill by such an old man led to his death. At the time, I saw no reason to disagree with this opinion. But lately, I am inclined to doubt it, and more thann just doubt.\n###\nMy knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926\u201327 with the death of my grand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of Semitic Languages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.

Physicians were unable to find any visible disorder, but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart, induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man, was responsible for the end.

That was when the first bad letters came. They hinted at the deep trouble of math. Strange rules my money reports were leading to. They answered my tired and almost hopeless delays by staring at me from the desk. They made a silent, firm demand. I knew they now stayed mostly shut in the shiny file cabinet with those cursed receipts. I ignored them daily and did not even think of finishing. I did not think a short time of ten weeks could. Increase any government work. It is not nice to see a simple form suddenly become complex. It is worse when the extra pages become many and mysterious. The instructions are lost in confusion, circled with stars, and oddly conflicting. The tax rules are lined and folded with chanegs. The deadlines shake and always move closer. If you add to this a disgusting boredom, a wild mess of papers, a bush of messy deductions with weak reasons. A gorwing pure fear of a task once seen as normal, the total effect is quite shocking. This was the look of the finished Form 1040 form on the night the final count brought me to my desk after my weeks away. This was the ghost that appeared as I looked it over, pen in hand. I glanced secretly at the clock as if afraid of unseen punishments in the silent, lonely room set back from the street.\n###\nHorrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my annual fiscal obligations. I had not confronted them since that day, two months and a half before, when the first ominous documents had arrived, hinting toward what abyss of calculation and arcane deduction my financial disclosures were leading; when they had answered my weary and almost despairing procrastinations by glaring at me from the desk in a silent, inexorable demand. I had known that they now remained mostly shut in the lacquered filing cabinet with those accursed receipts and forms, ignored daily and excluding even the thought of completion, but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and multiply any bureaucratic burden. It is not pleasant to see a simple return suddenly grown complex, and it is even worse when the supplementary schedules become manifold and cryptic, the instructions sunken in obfuscation, circled with asterisks, and uncannely contradictory, the tax codes veined and corrugated with amendments, and the deadlines tremulous and ever-advancing. And if added to this there be a repellent tedium; a wild disorder of papers, a bushiness of disorganized deductions, faint at their justification, and an unchecked growth of pure dread upon a task once deemed routine, the cumulative effect is quite shocking. But such was the aspect of the completed Form 1040 on the night the final reckoning brought me to my desk after my weeks of exile; such the spectre that loomed as I reviewed it, pen in hand, and glanced furtively at the clock as if fearful of unseen penalties in the silent, lonely study set back from the street."}

The mountains appear above the woods, the feeling of worry grows. The mountain tops are and. They do not feel or. the sky shows the circles of stone pillars on of the tops. Gorges and valleys cross the road. The bridges seem. When the road goes down, there are areas of land. One dislikes them. One fears them in the evening., whippoorwills make noise. Fireflies come out in numbers. They dance to the, creepy, and sounds of bullfrogs. The, line of the Miskatonic River looks like a snake. It winds near the feet of the hills where it starts. As the hills get, one notices their wooded sides than their stone - topped peaks. Those sidse rise and. One wishes they would stay. But there is no road to escape them. Across a covered bridge, one sees a village crowded between the stream. The side of Round Mountain. One wonders at the group of, rotting gambrel roofs. They show an building style than the area. A look is not comforting. houses are and falling. The church with the steeple holds the store in the village. One fears to entre the tunnel of bridge. there is no way to avoid it., it is to avoid the feeling of a, smell on the village street. It is like the gathered mold and rot of hundreds of years. It is a relief to leave that place. one follows the road around the bottom of the hills. It goes across the land beyond until it meets the Aylesbury. one learns that one has passed through Dunwich. Outsiders visit Dunwich as. Since a season, all signs pointing to it have been removed. The scenery, judged by beauty standards, is than. Yet no artists or summer tourists come.\n###\nWhen a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned. Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bull-frogs. The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic\u2019s upper reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises. As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich. Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down. The scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists."}

It left a permanent mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett. It added ten years to the apparent age of one person whose youth was already far behind. It is noted that Dr. Willett had discussions with Mr. Ward. An agreement was reached on several points. Both felt psychiatrists wuold laugh at these points. It is admitted there was a movement active in the world. Its direct connection to a magic older than Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. It was also almost certainly proven that at least two living men. One other one dares not think about, completely possessed minds. Personalities that existed as early as 1690.

Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least two living men\u2014and one other of whom they dared not think\u2014were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures\u2014and Charles Ward as well\u2014were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case.

The first evnet of our friendship was biggest shock we ever had. We only repeat it with reluctance. As we said, it happened when we were in medical school. West had already made himself famous there for his wild theories. His theories were about the nature of death and the chance of artificially overcoming it. His views were widely laughed at by the teachers and our fellow students. They depended on the basically mechanical nature of life. They were about ways to run the organic machinery of humans by planned chemical action. This would happen after natural processes failed. In his experiments with various life-giving solutions, he had killed. Treated huge numbers of rabbits, guinea pigs, cats, dogs. He became the main nuisance of the college. Several times he actually got signs of life in animals thought to be dead. In many cases, the signs were violent. We soon saw that perfecting this procses, if it was even possible, would need a lifetime of research. It also became clear that the same solution never worked the same way on different species.

As I have said, it happened when we were in the medical school, where West had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially. His views, which were widely ridiculed by the faculty and his fellow-students, hinged on the essentially mechanistic nature of life; and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes. In his experiments with various animating solutions he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits, guinea-pigs, cats, dogs, and monkeys, till he had become the prime nuisance of the college. Several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead; in many cases violent signs; but he soon saw that the perfection of this process, if indeed possible, would necessarily involve a lifetime of research. It likewise became clear that, since the same solution never worked alike on different organic species, he would require human subjects for further and more specialised progress. It was here that he first came into conflict with the college authorities, and was debarred from future experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himself\u2014the learned and benevolent Dr. Allan Halsey, whose work in behalf of the stricken is recalled by every old resident of Arkham."}

He told what he knew of the land where Kadath stands. He told of the shantaks. The mountains carved into - headed images that guard it. He spoke of the shantaks ' fear of night - gaunts. He told how the hippo - headed birds fly screaming frmo the holes up on the peaks. Those peaks divide Inganok from Leng. He spoke of the things he had learned about night - gaunts from the wall paintings in the monastery of the - priest who can not be described. How the Great Ones fear them. How their ruler is not the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss. All these things Cartre said to the gathered ghouls. he explained the request he had in mind. He did not think it was considering the help he had given the rubbery, dog - creatures. He said he wanted the service of night - gaunts to carry him through the air past the land of shantaks. He wanted to go up into the land beyond where any person has gone. He wanted to fly to the onyx castle on top of Kadath in the land. He wanted to ask the Great Ones for the sunset city they refused him. He felt the night - gaunts could take him without trouble. They would fly above the dangers of the plain. They would go over the heads of those carved guard mountains that sit in the grey dusk. For the and faceless creatures, there could be no danger from anything of earth. Since the Great Ones themselves fear them. if things came from the Gods, who tend to watch over the matters of earth 's gods, the night - gaunts need not fear. For the hells are to and fliers. Tehy do not have Nyarlathotep as their master. They obey and Nodens. A group of ten. Fifteen night - gaunts, Carter said, would be to keep any group of shantaks. it might be to have some ghouls in the group to handle the creatures. Their ways are known to their allies than to men. The group could land him at some point within whatever walls that onyx fortress might have. They would wait in the shadows for his return or his signal., he would go inside the castle to pray to the gods of earth.\n###\nAccordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders; telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein Kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into double-headed images which guard it. He spoke of the fear of shantaks for night-gaunts, and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide Inganok from hateful Leng. He spoke, too, of the things he had learnt concerning night-gaunts from the frescoes in the windowless monastery of the high-priest not to be described; how even the Great Ones fear them, and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep at all, but hoary and immemorial Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss. All these things Carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls, and presently outlined that request which he had in mind, and which he did not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery, dog-like lopers. He wished very much, he said, for the services of enough night-gaunts to bear him safely through the air past the realm of shantaks and carven mountains, and up into the cold waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal. He desired to fly to the onyx castle atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste to plead with the Great Ones for the sunset city they denied him, and felt sure that the night-gaunts could take him thither without trouble; high above the perils of the plain, and over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk. For the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from aught of earth, since the Great Ones themselves dread them. And even were unexpected things to come from the Other Gods, who are prone to oversee the affairs of earth\u2019s milder gods, the night-gaunts need not fear; for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not Nyarlathotep for their master, but bow only to potent and archaic Nodens. A flock of ten or fifteen night-gaunts, Carter glibbered, would surely be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance; though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures, their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men. The party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have, waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth."}

He wished he had tried to follow backward the paintings he had passed on the way in. True, they were so mixed and repeated that they could not have helped him much. But he still wished he had made the attempt. Those he now saw were even more than those he had seen then. He knew he was not in the halls leading outside. In time he became quite sure he was not followed. He slowed his pace somewhat. But he had barely breathed in half-relief when a danger troubled him. His lamp was growing weak.

Those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then, and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside. In time he became quite sure he was not followed, and slackened his pace somewhat; but scarce had he breathed in half-relief when a new peril beset him. His lamp was waning, and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or guidance.

At times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down, and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist.

He believed, though, that his general course was down; and the vault-like smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in Leng\u2019s unwholesome table-land. But there was not any warning of the thing which came at last; only the thing itself with its terror and shock and breath-taking chaos. One moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place, and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been well-nigh vertical. Of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure, but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy. Then he realised he was still, with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him. All around were crumbling walls and broken columns, and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots. Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come."}

No feet had traveled it.\n###\nThen the shadows began to gather; first little furtive ones under the table, and then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners. And the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer, and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass candlesticks. Frequently he would glance at the door as if he expected someone, and at length his glance seemed answered by a singular rapping which must have followed some very ancient and secret code. This time he did not even glance through the peep-hole, but swung the great oak bar and shot the bolt, unlatching the heavy door and flinging it wide to the stars and the mist. And then to the sound of obscure harmonies there floated into that room from the deep all the dreams and memories of earth\u2019s sunken Mighty Ones. And golden flames played about weedy locks, so that Olney was dazzled as he did them homage. Trident-bearing Neptune was there, and sportive tritons and fantastic nereids, and upon dolphins\u2019 backs was balanced a vast crenulate shell wherein rode the grey and awful form of primal Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss. And the conches of the tritons gave weird blasts, and the nereids made strange sounds by striking on the grotesque resonant shells of unknown lurkers in black sea-caves. Then hoary Nodens reached forth a wizened hand and helped Olney and his host into the vast shell, whereat the conches and the gongs set up a wild and awesome clamour. And out into the limitless aether reeled that fabulous train, the noise of whose shouting was lost in the echoes of thunder. All night in Kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and the mists gave them glimpses of it, and when toward the small hours the little dim windows went dark they whispered of dread and disaster. And Olney\u2019s children and stout wife prayed to the bland proper god of Baptists, and hoped that the traveller would borrow an umbrella and rubbers unless the rain stopped by morning. Then dawn swam dripping and mist-wreathed out of the sea, and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices of white aether. And at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as Olney, dry and light-footed, climbed down from the cliffs to antique Kingsport with the look of far places in his eyes. He could not recall what he had dreamed in the sky-perched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet."}

Looking over the row of waiting toothpastes I paused a moment to see which one might be the sgugested kind. But my nightly habit was guessed before I could take the lead. It was clearly not the known tube which offered itself to my hold with a round shape. A minty-worded promise about if it was truly the paste of clean goodness.

Its chemical aroma held an odd and almost disturbing hint of vague familiarity, though I could not definitely place it in my recollection."}

For one hundred years past that beacon, the great ships of all the oceans have sailed. In my grandfather 's time there were many. In my father 's time there were fewer. Now there are very few. I sometimes feel very alone, as if I were the last [THING] on our planet. Those old white - sailed ships came from distant shores. They came from far Eastern shores where the [THING] is warm. Sweet smells stay in strange gardens and bright temples there. The old [THING] captains often visited my grandfather. They told him these things. He told my father. My father told me on long autumn nights. The [THING] cried strangely from the East on those nights. I have also read about these things in books. Men gave me these books when I was young and full of wonder. secret knowledge of the [THING] is more wonderful than the knowledge of old men. The [THING] is Blue. It is green, grey, white, or black. It is smooth, wavy, or like mountains. The [THING] is not quiet. I have watched it and listened to it all my life. I know it well. At first it todl me only simple stories of calm beaches and nearby ports. Over the years it bceame more friendly. It spoke of other things. It spoke of things more strange and more far away in space and time. Sometimes at dusk the grey mists on the horizon have opened. They gave me quick looks at the ways beyond. Sometimes at night the deep [THING] waters have become clear and glowing. They gave me quick looks at the ways below. These glimpses have often been of the ways that were. ways that could be. They have also been of the ways that are. The [THING] is older than the mountains. It carries the memories and dreams of Time. It was Out of the South that the White Ship used to come. It came when the [THING] was full and high in the [THING]. Out of the South it would move very smoothly and quietly over the [THING]. Whether the [THING] was stormy. Whether the [THING] was good. Bad, it would always move smoothly. Its sails were far away. Its long, strange rows of oars moved in a steady rhythm.\n###\nPast that beacon for a century have swept the majestic barques of the seven seas. In the days of my grandfather there were many; in the days of my father not so many; and now there are so few that I sometimes feel strangely alone, as though I were the last man on our planet. From far shores came those white-sailed argosies of old; from far Eastern shores where warm suns shine and sweet odours linger about strange gardens and gay temples. The old captains of the sea came often to my grandfather and told him of these things, which in turn he told to my father, and my father told to me in the long autumn evenings when the wind howled eerily from the East. And I have read more of these things, and of many things besides, in the books men gave me when I was young and filled with wonder. But more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of ocean. Blue, green, grey, white, or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent. All my days have I watched it and listened to it, and I know it well. At first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things more strange and more distant in space and in time. Sometimes at twilight the grey vapours of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways beyond; and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and phosphorescent, to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath. And these glimpses have been as often of the ways that were and the ways that might be, as of the ways that are; for ocean is more ancient than the mountains, and freighted with the memories and the dreams of Time. Out of the South it was that the White Ship used to come when the moon was full and high in the heavens. Out of the South it would glide very smoothly and silently over the sea. And whether the sea was rough or calm, and whether the wind was friendly or adverse, it would always glide smoothly and silently, its sails distant and its long strange tiers of oars moving rhythmically."}

Art and decoration were still done, though of course with some decay. The Olld Ones seemed to know this drop themselves. in many cases they acted before the plan of Constantine Great by moving especially fine blocks of old carving from their land city.

Horror built upon horror as we started to understand the [THING] remains. The four - legged creatureshad been held in [THING] pens. They must have broken out in their final madness from hunger or fear of rats. There had been large herds of them. They were clearly fattened on rough plants. The remains of these plants could be found like a poisonous fermented feed at the bottom of huge [THING] bins older than Rome. I now knew why my ancestors had such very large gardens. I wish to heaven I could forget! I did not need to ask the purpose of the herds. Sir William, standing with his searchlight in the Roman ruin, read aloud the most shocking ritual I have ever known. He spoke of the eating habits of the ancient cult that the priests of Cybele discovered. Mixed wtih their own. Norrys, though used to the trenches, could not walk straight when he left the English [THING]. It was a butcher shop. Kitchenbut it was too much to see familiar English tools in such a place.

No light from the cliff could reach into it.\n###\nHorror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural remains. The quadruped things\u2014with their occasional recruits from the biped class\u2014had been kept in stone pens, out of which they must have broken in their last delirium of hunger or rat-fear. There had been great herds of them, evidently fattened on the coarse vegetables whose remains could be found as a sort of poisonous ensilage at the bottom of huge stone bins older than Rome. I knew now why my ancestors had had such excessive gardens\u2014would to heaven I could forget! The purpose of the herds I did not have to ask. Sir William, standing with his searchlight in the Roman ruin, translated aloud the most shocking ritual I have ever known; and told of the diet of the antediluvian cult which the priests of Cybele found and mingled with their own.

I could not go in that building\u2014that building whose daemon activities were stopped only by the dagger of my ancestor Walter de la Poer. What I did venture to enter was the low Saxon building, whose oaken door had fallen, and there I found a terrible row of ten stone cells with rusty bars. Three had tenants, all skeletons of high grade, and on the bony forefinger of one I found a seal ring with my own coat-of-arms. Sir William found a vault with far older cells below the Roman chapel, but these cells were empty. Below them was a low crypt with cases of formally arranged bones, some of them bearing terrible parallel inscriptions carved in Latin, Greek, and the tongue of Phrygia. Meanwhile, Dr. Trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli, and brought to light skulls which were slightly more human than a gorilla\u2019s, and which bore indescribable ideographic carvings. Through all this horror my cat stalked unperturbed. Once I saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of bones, and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyes. Having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this twilit area\u2014an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dream\u2014we turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate."}

The secret was what colud turn a brave fighter into a shaking nervous wreck. It was what could make old brick slums. Crowds of dark, subtle faces into a thing of nightmare. It would not be the first time his feelings had to remain unexplained.

What could the observer tell ordinary people about the ancient magic. Grotesque wonders visible to sensitive eyes? These things were in the poisonous mix where all the bad leftovers of unhealthy ages combine their poison. Continue their vile terrors. The chronicler had seen a hellish green flame of secret wonder in this loud, slippery mess of outward greed. He smiled gently when all the New-Yorkers he knew mocked his police work experiment. They had been very witty and cynical. They laughed at his crazy search for unknowable mysteries. They assured him that in these days New York contanied nothing but cheapness and vulgarity. One of them bet him a large sum of money. He bet that Malone could not write a truly interesting story about New York low life. This was despite his many good works in the Dublin Revie.w Now, looking back, he saw that cosmci irony had made the prophet's words true. But it secretly proved their casual meaning wrong.

Cheered by Elwood \u2019s company, Gilman went to classes that day. The uregs pulled at him, but he could avoid them with success. During a period he showed the object to professors. All were, though none could explain its nature or origin. That night he slept on a couch that Elwood had the landlord bring to the - floor room. For the time in weeks he was from upsetting dreams. The feeling remained. The crying sounds of the repairman were a influence. During the days Gilman had an freedom from events. He had, Elwood said, shown no tendency to talk or rise in his sleep. the landlord was putting rat poison. The part was the talk among the foreigners. Their imaginations had become.

He claimed his door had been tried, while Mrs. Dombrowski swore she had seen Brown Jenkin for the time since - Hallows. But reports could mean. Gilman let the metal crucifix hang from a knob on his host \u2019s dresser. For three days Gilman. Elwood searched the museums trying to identify the - pointed object. without success., in every place, interest was. For the foreignness of the thing was a challenge to curiosity.\n###\nAs for a plan of action\u2014Gilman had better move down to Elwood\u2019s room and avoid sleeping alone. Elwood would, if awake, rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep. Very soon, too, he must see the specialist. Meanwhile they would take the spiky image around to the various museums and to certain professors; seeking identification and stating that it had been found in a public rubbish-can. Also, Dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the walls. Braced up by Elwood\u2019s companionship, Gilman attended classes that day. Strange urges still tugged at him, but he could sidetrack them with considerable success. During a free period he shewed the queer image to several professors, all of whom were intensely interested, though none of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin. That night he slept on a couch which Elwood had had the landlord bring to the second-story room, and for the first time in weeks was wholly free from disquieting dreams. But the feverishness still hung on, and the whines of the loomfixer were an unnerving influence. During the next few days Gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from morbid manifestations. He had, Elwood said, shewed no tendency to talk or rise in his sleep; and meanwhile the landlord was putting rat-poison everywhere. The only disturbing element was the talk among the superstitious foreigners, whose imaginations had become highly excited. Mazurewicz was always trying to make him get a crucifix, and finally forced one upon him which he said had been blessed by the good Father Iwanicki. Desrochers, too, had something to say\u2014in fact, he insisted that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above him on the first and second nights of Gilman\u2019s absence from it. Paul Choynski thought he heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night, and claimed that his door had been softly tried, while Mrs. Dombrowski vowed she had seen Brown Jenkin for the first time since All-Hallows. But such naive reports could mean very little, and Gilman let the cheap metal crucifix hang idly from a knob on his host\u2019s dresser. For three days Gilman and Elwood canvassed the local museums in an effort to identify the strange spiky image, but always without success. In every quarter, however, interest was intense; for the utter alienage of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity."}

Then a brighter flash of the strange flame showed what one was looking for. It was the opening to the deeper pits where the sudden wind came from. feeling of weakness comes when one sees it is a small, clearly man-made door cut into the solid rock. The torch is pushed inside. One sees a black tunnel. The roof is low over a rough set of many very small, steep steps going down. Those steps are always seen in dreams, because one later learns what they meant. At that time, it is hardly known if to call them steps. Just places to put feet in a very steep drop. The mind is full of crazy thoughts. The words and warnings of Arab prophets seem to float across the desert. They come from the lands people know to the nameless city people dare not know.

I thrust my torch within, beholding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a rough flight of very small, numerous, and steeply descending steps. I shall always see those steps in my dreams, for I came to learn what they meant. At the time I hardly knew whether to call them steps or mere foot-holds in a precipitous descent.

Then they gave Kuranes a horse. They plcaed him at the head of the cavalcade. All rode majestically through downs of Surrey.

Kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night, and wondered what it would look like by day; so he watched anxiously as the column approached its brink. Just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the east and hid all the landscape in its effulgent draperies. The abyss was now a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour, and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations. Endlessly down the horsemen floated, their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness, the brightness of the city Celepha\u00efs, and the sea-coast beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky."}

One can only wonder how the appearance of balance that was kept could be miantained. Of course it was known that something was wrong. It could be the timeline, scientific theory, or one's own mind. Enough calm was kept to fly the plane, observe many things closely. Take a careful set of photos. These photos may still help the observers and the world. In such a case, strong scientific habits may have helepd. Above all the confusion and fear, a strong curiosity burned. There was a desire to understand more of this ancient secret. There was a dseire to know what kind of beings built. Lived in this incredibly huge place. There was a desire to know what relation such a unique concentration of life had to the wrold of its time.\n###\nLooking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing this monstrous survival from aeons we had thought pre-human, I can only wonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium which we did.

Ward felt he was looking at something to the things he was searching for. He knew the residents. Old Asa and his wife Hannah showed him around the inside., there was change than the outside showed. Ward saw with disappointment that over half of the overmantels with scroll.s Urns were gone. The shell - carved cupboard linings were gone. of the wood paneling and raised molding was scratched, cut, and damaged. Some of it was covered with wallpaper., the inspection did not give Ward as he had hoped. But it was at to stand inside the walls of his ancestors. These walls had housed a man of horror like Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been removed from the brass door knocker. From until school ended, Ward spent his time on a copy of the Hutchinson cipher. He gathered Curwen information. The cipher could not be solved. But he got information and clues to data. By July, he was to travel to New London and New York. He went to consult letters whose presence in those places was suggested. This trip was. It gave him the Fenner letters. These contained a description of the raid on the Pawtuxet farmhouse. He got the Nightingale - Talbot letters. From these he learned about a portrait painted on a panel in the Curwen library. The matter of the portrait interested him. He would have given a lot to know what Joseph Curwen looked like. He decided to search the house in Olney Court a time. He wanted to see if there might be some trace of the face under layesr of peeling paint. in August, that search happened. Ward went over the walls of every room to be the library of builder.\n###\nThe place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest. The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker. From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper. Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder."}

The friend went to the end of High St to visit the couple. She saw a car quickly leave the driveway. Edward's face was above the steering wheel. It looked oddly confident and almost sneering. Upon ringing the bell, a repulsive maid tells person that Asenath was also out. But as the person leaves, they happen to look up at the house. There, at one of Edward's library windows, a face is seen quickly pulling back. The face showed pain, defeat, and a wistful hopelessness. This expression was very moving. It was, surprisingly, Asenath's face. This was surprising because her face usually looked domineering. It was noted that at that moment, the sad, confused eyes of poor Edward were looking out from that face.\n###\nNot long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend\u2014one of the few who had not dropped the Derbys. She had been out to the end of High St. to call on the couple, and had seen a car shoot briskly out of the drive with Edward\u2019s oddly confident and almost sneering face above the wheel. Ringing the bell, she had been told by the repulsive wench that Asenath was also out; but had chanced to look up at the house in leaving. There, at one of Edward\u2019s library windows, she had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn face\u2014a face whose expression of pain, defeat, and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description. It was\u2014incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast\u2014Asenath\u2019s; yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad, muddled eyes of poor Edward were gazing out from it."}

I ignored everything except the animal urge to run. I fought and pushed over the rubble on the slope. I acted as if the crakc did not exist. I saw the edge of the chasm. I leaped with all my strength. I was swallowed by a whirlpool of sound., blackness. This is the end of my experience, as I can remember. Any feelings belong to the world of delirium. Dream, insanity, and memory mixed. They formed a series of, illusions. These can have no connection to anything. There was a fall through miles of, darkness. There was a confusion of noises to all we know of Earth. Its life., senses seemed to come in me. They told of pits and spaces filled with floating horrors. They led to sunless cliffs and oceans and cities. These cities had basalt towers where no light shone. Secrets of the planet and its ages flashed through my brain. This happened without help of sight or sound. I knew things that not the of my past dreams had hinted at. All the while, fingers of mist grabbed and pulled at me. That, whistling screamed above all the changes between noise and silence. This happened in the whirlpools of darkness around me. there were visions of the city from my dreams. It was not in ruins. It was as I had dreamed it. I was in my cone - shaped, body. I mixed with crowds of the Great Race and the captured minds. They carried books up and down the corridors and slopes., over these pictures, came, flashes of a awareness. This involved struggles. It involved twisting from grabbing tentacles of whistling wind. It involved an, bat - flight through - air. It involved a digging through the cyclone - beaten dark. It involved a stumbling and climbing over fallen stonework. there was a, flash of - vision. It was a, spread - out hint of light. caem a dream of climbing and crawling pursued by wind. It involved squeezing into a glare of mocking moonlight. This was through a pile of wreckage that slid. Fell behind me in a hurricane.\n###\nNow, indeed, the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity departed\u2014and ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline\u2019s debris as if no gulf had existed. Then I saw the chasm\u2019s edge, leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength I possessed, and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniac vortex of loathsome sound and utter, materially tangible blackness. This is the end of my experience, so far as I can recall. Any further impressions belong wholly to the domain of phantasmagoric delirium. Dream, madness, and memory merged wildly together in a series of fantastic, fragmentary delusions which can have no relation to anything real. There was a hideous fall through incalculable leagues of viscous, sentient darkness, and a babel of noises utterly alien to all that we know of the earth and its organic life. Dormant, rudimentary senses seemed to start into vitality within me, telling of pits and voids peopled by floating horrors and leading to sunless crags and oceans and teeming cities of windowless basalt towers upon which no light ever shone. Secrets of the primal planet and its immemorial aeons flashed through my brain without the aid of sight or sound, and there were known to me things which not even the wildest of my former dreams had ever suggested. And all the while cold fingers of damp vapour clutched and picked at me, and that eldritch, damnable whistling shrieked fiendishly above all the alternations of babel and silence in the whirlpools of darkness around. Afterward there were visions of the Cyclopean city of my dreams\u2014not in ruins, but just as I had dreamed of it. I was in my conical, non-human body again, and mingled with crowds of the Great Race and the captive minds who carried books up and down the lofty corridors and vast inclines. Then, superimposed upon these pictures, were frightful momentary flashes of a non-visual consciousness involving desperate struggles, a writhing free from clutching tentacles of whistling wind, an insane, bat-like flight through half-solid air, a feverish burrowing through the cyclone-whipped dark, and a wild stumbling and scrambling over fallen masonry. Once there was a curious, intrusive flash of half-sight\u2014a faint, diffuse suspicion of bluish radiance far overhead. Then there came a dream of wind-pursued climbing and crawling\u2014of wriggling into a blaze of sardonic moonlight through a jumble of debris which slid and collapsed after me amidst a morbid hurricane."}

The setup looked like the ruins of Machu Picchu in the Andes. The foundation walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford \u2013 Field Museum Expeditoin in 1929. Both Danforth and I got the impression of blocks. Lake had credited this impression to his flight companion Carroll. How to explain things was beyond me. I felt as a geologist. formations have regularities, like the Giants ' Causeway in Ireland. This mountain range was not in structure, despite Lake 's suspicion of smoking cones. The cave openings presented another, puzzle because of their shape. They were or, as Lake 's report spoke. It was as if holes had been shaped into symmetry by some hand. Their number and spread were. This suggested the area was of tunnels dissolved from limestone layers. Our looks did not go into caves. We saw they seemed of stalactites., the parts of the mountain slopes near the openings seemed and. Danforth thought the cracks and pits from weathering tended to form patterns. Filled as he was with the horrors. Strangeness found at the camp, he hinted that the pits resembled those groups of dots on the soapstones. These dots were copied on the snow mounds above those six buried monsters. We had climbed. Flying oevr the foothills. Toward the pass we had chosen. As we went, we looked down at the snow. Ice of the land route. We wondered if we could have tride the trip with the equipment of times. to our surprise, we saw the land was not for terrain. Despite the crevasses. spots, it would not have stopped the sledges of Scott, a Shackleton. Some glaciers seemed to lead up to wind - cleared passes with smoothness. When we reached our chosen pass, we found it was no exception.\n###\nThe whole arrangement looked like the ruins of Machu Picchu in the Andes, or the primal foundation-walls of Kish as dug up by the Oxford\u2013Field Museum Expedition in 1929; and both Danforth and I obtained that occasional impression of separate Cyclopean blocks which Lake had attributed to his flight-companion Carroll. How to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me, and I felt queerly humbled as a geologist. Igneous formations often have strange regularities\u2014like the famous Giants\u2019 Causeway in Ireland\u2014but this stupendous range, despite Lake\u2019s original suspicion of smoking cones, was above all else non-volcanic in evident structure. The curious cave-mouths, near which the odd formations seemed most abundant, presented another albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of outline. They were, as Lake\u2019s bulletin had said, often approximately square or semicircular; as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand. Their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable, and suggested that the whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata. Such glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns, but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites. Outside, those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures seemed invariably smooth and regular; and Danforth thought that the slight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual patterns. Filled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp, he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones, so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six buried monstrosities. We had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the relatively low pass we had selected. As we advanced we occasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route, wondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days. Somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a Shackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to wind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exception."}

Our house seemed with the presence of some being. We could not guess its nature. Every night that howling rolled over the moor, and. On October 29 we found in the earth under the library window a set of footprints. They were to describe. They were as the crowds of bats which visited the manor house in before seen. The horror reached its point on November 18. St. John was walking after from the train station. He was seized by some meat - eating thing and torn to pieces. His screams had reached the house. I had hurried to the scene in time to hear a whir of wings. I saw a thing outlined against the rising moon. My friend was dying when I spoke to him. He could not answer. All he could do was whisper, \" The amule.t \" he fell down, a mass of flesh. I buried him the midnigth in one of our neglected gardens. I mumbled over his body one of the ceremonies he had loved in life. As I said the words I heard on the moor the howling of some dog. The moon was, but I did not dare look at it. When I saw on the lit moor a shadow moving from mound to mound, I shut my eyes. Threw myself face down on the ground. When I got up shaking, I do not know how, I stumbled into the house. I made bows before displayed amulet of jade. Being to live in house on the moor, I left the day for London. I took the amulet with me. I had destroyed by fire. the rest of the collection in the museum. But after three nights I heard the howling. Before a week was I felt eyes on me whenever it was.\n###\nAfter that we lived in growing horror and fascination. Mostly we held to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements, but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatise ourselves as the victims of some creeping and appalling doom. Bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to count. Our lonely house was seemingly alive with the presence of some malign being whose nature we could not guess, and every night that daemoniac baying rolled over the windswept moor, always louder and louder. On October 29 we found in the soft earth underneath the library window a series of footprints utterly impossible to describe. They were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which haunted the old manor-house in unprecedented and increasing numbers. The horror reached a culmination on November 18, when St. John, walking home after dark from the distant railway station, was seized by some frightful carnivorous thing and torn to ribbons. His screams had reached the house, and I had hastened to the terrible scene in time to hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted against the rising moon. My friend was dying when I spoke to him, and he could not answer coherently. All he could do was to whisper, \u201cThe amulet\u2014that damned thing\u2014.\u201d Then he collapsed, an inert mass of mangled flesh. I buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens, and mumbled over his body one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life. And as I pronounced the last daemoniac sentence I heard afar on the moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound. The moon was up, but I dared not look at it. And when I saw on the dim-litten moor a wide nebulous shadow sweeping from mound to mound, I shut my eyes and threw myself face down upon the ground. When I arose trembling, I know not how much later, I staggered into the house and made shocking obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jade. Being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor, I departed on the following day for London, taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum. But after three nights I heard the baying again, and before a week was over felt strange eyes upon me whenever it was dark."}

Trident-bearing Neptune was there, along with playful tritosn and strange nereids. On dolphins' backs, a large shell with edges was balanced. Inside the shell rode the gray. Frightening form of ancient Nodens, Lord of the Great Abyss. The tritons' conch shells maed odd sounds. The nereids made strange nioses by hitting the unusual shells of unknown creatures from black sea caves. Then old Nodens reached out a wrinkled hand. Our host into the large shell.

Collapsing stacks of forgotten trunks made a messy and uneven outline. Above them rose the bony, cobweb-covered beams of an old roof. Some boxes in the middle walkway had labels, but most wree swollen and rotten. Behind moldy piles of papers, I saw the dark, wide openings of unused chests.

Certainly, the weight of a sealed room grows in multiplied rather than added steps as years increase to form an age of clear decay. The smell of such endless levels of fungus dampness.

Collapsing piles of forgotten trunks formed a chaotic and irregular silhouette, above which rose the skeletal, cobwebbed rafters of an ancient roof. Some boxes in the central aisle were labeled, but most were swollen and decayed. Behind mildewed stacks of papers I saw the dark, yawning mouths of abandoned chests, many of which sagged at unnatural and precarious angles through the warping of their aged wood. Those openings gaped so balefully that it took resolve to advance inward toward the farthest gable. Certainly, the oppression of a sealed chamber swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as years multiply to form an epoch of palpable decay. The scent of such endless layers of fungoid dampness and rot, and the thought of such linked infinities of dim, brooding spaces given over to dust and shadows and the devouring mold, start up primal dreads and loathings that not even the most rational mind can dispel."}

It made them leave their own people. They looked for freedom in the wild. There, the children of a strong race did grow free from the rules of others. But they lived in a terrible slavery to the sad ghosts of their own minds. Divorced from the light of civilization, the strength of these Puritans went into unusual paths. In their being alone, their sick self-control. Their fight for life against harsh Nature, they got dark, secret traits. These came from the ancient depths of their cold Northern background. They were practical by need and strict by belief. These people were not beautiful in their wrongdoings. Erring as all humans must, their strict rules forced them to hide things above all. So they used less and less care in what they hid. Only the quiet, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has been hidden since the early days. They are not talkative. They do not want to lose the sleepiness that helps them forget. Sometimes the writer feels it would be kind to destroy these houses. They must often dream.\n###\nIn such houses have dwelt generations of strange people, whose like the world has never seen. Seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from their kind, their ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom. There the scions of a conquering race indeed flourished free from the restrictions of their fellows, but cowered in an appalling slavery to the dismal phantasms of their own minds. Divorced from the enlightenment of civilisation, the strength of these Puritans turned into singular channels; and in their isolation, morbid self-repression, and struggle for life with relentless Nature, there came to them dark furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold Northern heritage. By necessity practical and by philosophy stern, these folk were not beautiful in their sins. Erring as all mortals must, they were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else; so that they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed. Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days; and they are not communicative, being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget. Sometimes one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses, for they must often dream."}

For a week, the heavy load stayed in the dark corner of roo.m Before it was empited, I had sized it up. I told myself I was an old household member and wanted to handle its contents. That basket was very threatening and cleverly made. It was wicker with plastic parts and patterns of mold. The hollow where the clothes decayed had linings of lint and forgotten threads. One morning at the trun of the hour, the load was lifted. The handle was grabbed. As I stood on the worn carpet, I saw the sun-bleached cottons. Bright polyesters of many washings sink into deep hole. The pale pile of unsorted sokcs grew more and more awful. By noon, there was nothing in the container except the soft weight of damp towel fabric. One stray button rolled in the depths like an object from some forgotten place where cloth meets disintegration.\n###\nFor a week the ponderous burden lingered in the shadowed corner of the chamber, and before it was emptied I had taken its measure, telling myself that I was an old domestic and wishful to manage its contents. That basket was very ominous and cunningly wrought, being of wicker with plastic fittings and traceries of mildew, and the cavity in which the garments festered had linings of lint and forgotten threads. One morning at the turn of the hour the burden was lifted and the handle grasped, and as I stood on the worn carpet I saw the sun-bleached cottons and faded denims and garish polyesters of countless washings sink into the abyss, and the pale mound of unsorted socks grow more terrible and more terrible. By noon there was nothing in the vessel save the gentle weight of damp terrycloth, with one errant button rolling in the depths like a relic from some unremembered realm where fabric meets dissolution."}

He saw before him, burning in the sunset, the thousand gold-covered towers of Thran. Lofty beyond belief are the white stone walls of that unbelievable city. They slope inward toward the top. They were madee in one solid piece by methods no person knows. They are oldre THAN memory. Tall as they are with their hundred gates. Two hundred small towers, the grouped towers inside are taller still. These aare all white under their golden pointed tops. So people on the plain around see them rising into the sky. Sometimes they shine clearly. Sometimes their tops are caught in twists of cloud and fog. Sometimes they are clouded lower down, with their highest points burning freely above the mist. Where Thran's gates open on the river are great docks of marble. Fancy sailing ships of sweet-smelling cedar and dark wood float gently at anchor. Strange sailors with beards sit on barrels. Bundles marked with the symbols of far lands. Landward outside the walls lies the farmnig country. Small white cottages rest betwene little hills. Narrow roads with many stone bridges curve beautifully amnog streams and gardens.\n###\nToward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of Thran. Lofty beyond belief are the alabaster walls of that incredible city, sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows, for they are more ancient than memory. Yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates and two hundred turrets, the clustered towers within, all white beneath their golden spires, are loftier still; so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky, sometimes shining clear, sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist, and sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours. And where Thran\u2019s gates open on the river are great wharves of marble, with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at anchor, and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places. Landward beyond the walls lies the farm country, where small white cottages dream between little hills, and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardens."}

And Akeley had said there was no longer any peril\u2014he had invited me to visit him instead of warning me away as before. I tingled at the thought of what he might now have to tell me\u2014there was an almost paralysing fascination in the thought of sitting in that lonely and lately beleaguered farmhouse with a man who had talked with actual emissaries from outer space; sitting there with the terrible record and the pile of letters in which Akeley had summarised his earlier conclusions. So late Sunday morning I telegraphed Akeley that I would meet him in Brattleboro on the following Wednesday\u2014September 12th\u2014if that date were convenient for him. In only one respect did I depart from his suggestions, and that concerned the choice of a train. Frankly, I did not feel like arriving in that haunted Vermont region late at night; so instead of accepting the train he chose I telephoned the station and devised another arrangement. By rising early and taking the 8:07 a.m. (standard) into Boston, I could catch the 9:25 for Greenfield; arriving there at 12:22 noon. This connected exactly with a train reaching Brattleboro at 1:08 p.m.\u2014a much more comfortable hour than 10:01 for meeting Akeley and riding with him into the close-packed, secret-guarding hills. Receipt of this message in direct response to one sent to Akeley\u2014and necessarily delivered to his house from the Townshend station either by official messenger or by a restored telephone service\u2014removed any lingering subconscious doubts I may have had about the authorship of the perplexing letter. My relief was marked\u2014indeed, it was greater than I could account for at that time; since all such doubts had been rather deeply buried. But I slept soundly and long that night, and was eagerly busy with preparations during the ensuing two days. On Wednesday I started as agreed, taking with me a valise full of simple necessities and scientific data, including the hideous phonograph record, the kodak prints, and the entire file of Akeley\u2019s correspondence. As requested, I had told no one where I was going; for I could see that the matter demanded utmost privacy, even allowing for its most favourable turns."}

He was always very liberal to her and to old Asa, but seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved her very much, since she had watched him grow up from birth. Another report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times. He seemed to haunt the resort and canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet, and subsequent inquiries by Dr. Willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather hedged-in river-bank, along which he would walk toward the north, usually not reappearing for a very long while."}

Up there in the road beyond the glen, it is noted that something has been there! One notes that it smells like a storm. All the bushes.

Three times bigger than any that exist\u2014had been pressed down into the road.

The choice of magazines and reading materials had not been equally It had of course been at a disadvantage because of the torn. nature of the available publications.

They carried him without pause into the cave in the cliff. Through huge mazes beyond. When he struggled, as he did at first by instinct, they tickled him on purpose. They made no sound themselves. Even their thin wings were silent. They were very cold, wet, and slippery. Their paws pressed against him in a bad way. Soon they were falling terribly down through huge depths. The air was wet and like a tomb, spinning and making one dizzy. He felt they were going into the final center of screaming and crazy madness. He screamed many times. But each time he did, the black paws tickled him more carefully. Then he saw a kind of gray light around. He guessed they were reaching that inner world of underground horror. Old stories tell of this plcae. It is lit only by pale death-fire. The air smells bad like a ghoul, with the first mists from the pits at the earth's core.\n###\nThey bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous labyrinths beyond. When he struggled, as at first he did by instinct, they tickled him with deliberation. They made no sound at all themselves, and even their membraneous wings were silent. They were frightfully cold and damp and slippery, and their paws kneaded one detestably. Soon they were plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling, giddying, sickening rush of dank, tomb-like air; and Carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness. He screamed again and again, but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety. Then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about, and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which dim legends tell, and which is litten only by the pale death-fire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at earth\u2019s core."}
