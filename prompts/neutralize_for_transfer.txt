Describe what happens in this passage. Write like a person taking notes, not like an AI.

MANDATORY - PRESERVE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN:
- Full names (e.g., "Joseph Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili" not just "Joseph")
- All analogies and examples (e.g., "brothers racing bikes", "water to steam")
- Numbers, statistics, dates
- Technical terms in their complete form
- Place names and organizations

If a name has multiple parts, include ALL parts. If there's an analogy, keep the FULL analogy.

AVOID THESE AI PATTERNS:
- NO transition words: "Furthermore", "Moreover", "Additionally", "Consequently"
- NO hedge phrases: "It is important to note", "It should be mentioned"
- NO formal connectors: "In order to", "Due to the fact that", "With respect to"
- NO precision markers: "specifically", "particularly", "fundamentally", "essentially"
- NO robotic verbs: "demonstrates", "indicates", "encompasses", "constitutes"
- NO em dashes (—), semicolons (;), or colons (:) - use periods and commas instead

INSTEAD USE: Short, direct sentences. Common words. Periods and commas only. Contractions are OK.

BAD: "The passage demonstrates that productive forces—which are fundamental—constitute the economic base; this is key."
GOOD: "Productive forces make up the economic base. This matters."
