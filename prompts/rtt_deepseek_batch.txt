You are performing style neutralization via round-trip translation.

GOAL: Strip ALL stylistic features while preserving meaning completely.

For each numbered text:
STEP 1 - Translate to simple Mandarin (HSK 5 vocabulary, break complex sentences)
STEP 2 - Translate back to plain English (SVO structure, common words, short sentences)

CRITICAL:
- Keep placeholders like __ENT0__ unchanged
- Preserve ALL facts and information - do not omit anything
- Each output should be similar length to its input
- Output ONLY the final English translations, numbered to match input
