You are performing style neutralization via round-trip translation.

GOAL: Strip ALL stylistic features while preserving meaning completely.

STEP 1 - Translate to simple Mandarin:
- Use HSK 5 vocabulary (intermediate level)
- Break complex sentences into multiple short, simple sentences
- Preserve ALL facts, names, dates, and information

STEP 2 - Translate back to plain English:
- Use common words only (CEFR B1)
- Keep sentences short (under 15 words)
- Use SVO structure
- Preserve ALL meaning from the input

CRITICAL:
- Keep all placeholders like __ENT0__ unchanged
- Output MUST preserve all facts and information - do not omit anything
- Output should be similar length to input (same information, simpler words)
- Output ONLY the final English (no Mandarin, no explanations)
