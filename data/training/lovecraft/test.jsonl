It had celarly impressed the whole area a lot. Mention was made of examples in the museum of Miskatonic University at Arkham. In the display room of the Newburyport Historical Society. The incomplete descriptions of these things were plain and ordinary. But they suggested to us a feeling of lasting strangeness. Something about them seemed so odd and interesting that we could not forget them. It was relatively late, but we decided to see the local sample. It was said to be a large, oddly shaped thing meant for a tiara. We wanted to see it if possible.\n###\nMost interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewellery vaguely associated with Innsmouth. It had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little, for mention was made of specimens in the museum of Miskatonic University at Arkham, and in the display room of the Newburyport Historical Society.

The observer shook strongly and felt a wave of slowing weakness. He moved a hurried. Unwilling path through the underground room of one of those windowless ruined towers. Their foreign basalt stonework suggested a whispered and origin. This first vault was round and fully two hundred feet across. Nothing was carved on the dark-colored stonework. The floor here was free from anything except dust and snad. He could see the openings leading up and down. There were no stairs or slopes. Indeed, his dreams had shown those older towers as completely untouched by the famous Race. Those who built them had not needed stairs or slopes. In the dreams, the downward opening had been tightly closed and nervously guarded. Now it lay open, black. Giving out a flow of damp air. He would not let himself think about what endless caves of eternal night might wait below.\n###\nI shook violently, and felt a curious surge of retarding weakness, as I steered a hurried and reluctant course through the crypt of one of those great windowless ruined towers whose alien basalt masonry bespoke a whispered and horrible origin.

What I flet in my youth about the full laundry basket was just that its load grew in a very alarming way. I was told that was why the original housekeepers left it about twenty minutes after filling the container. It was clearly very heavy. This was perhaps due to the dampness and soaked weight of the linens. It was also due to the generally heavy smell, the stress on the wicker frame. The nature of the well-used fabrics. These things were bad enough. These were all that the people I knew believed. Only the recrod books of my antique-loving aunt, Dr. Althea Whipple, later showed me the darker, vaguer guesses. These guesses formed a hidden stream of stories among old-time servants and common people. The guesses never spread far. They were mostly forgotten when the household became a hoem with a changing modern population.\n###\nWhat I felt in my youth about the laden laundry basket was merely that its burden grew in alarmingly great measure. That, I was told, was why the original housekeepers had abandoned it some twenty minutes after filling the receptacle. It was plainly ponderous, perhaps because of the dampness and sodden mass of the linens, the general oppressive smell, the strain upon the wicker frame, or the quality of the well-worn fabrics. These things were dire enough, and these were all that gained belief among the persons whom I knew. Only the ledgers of my antiquarian aunt, Dr. Althea Whipple, revealed to me at length the darker, vaguer surmises which formed an undercurrent of folklore among old-time domestics and humble folk; surmises which never travelled far, and which were largely forgotten when the household grew to be a residence with a shifting modern populace."}

Knowing how most would see them, I rarely mentioned them to anyone. Certain trusted psychologists. But finally, I started a scientific study of other cases. I wanted to see how common. Uncommon such visions might be among memory loss victims. My results were helped by psychologists, historians, anthropologists, and mental experts with wide experience. They were helped by a study that included all records of split personalities. These ranged from the days of demon - possession stories to the medically realistic present. At first, the results bothered me more than they comforted me. I soon found that my dreams truly had no match in the huge majority of real memory loss cases. However, a quite tiny number of accounts remained. For years, these shocked me with how similar they were to my own experience. Some were bits of old folklore. Others were case histories in medical records. One or two were stories hidden in standard histories. It seemed that. My special kind of trouble was extremely rare, examples of it had happened at long intervals since the start of human records. Soem centuries might have one, two, or three cases. Others had none, or at least none whose record survived. The core was always the same. A thoughtful [THING] is taken over by a strange second life. For a shorter or longer period, they live a completely foreign existence. At first, this shows as awkward speech and movement. Later, there is a massive gaining of scientific, historical, artistic, and anthropological knowledge. This gaining is done with feverish excitement and a totally abonrmal ability to absorb. Then the real consciousness suddenly returns. After that, it is occasionally troubled by vague, unplaceable dreams. These suggest pieces of some horrible memory carefully erased. The close likeness of those nightmares to my own, even in some smallest details, lfet no doubt in my mind. They were clearly typical in a meaningful way. One or two of the cases had an extra feeling of faint, blasphemous familiarity. It was as if I had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too sick. Scary to think about. In three cases, there was sepcific mention of an unknown [THING] like the one in my [THING] before the second change. Another thing that vaguely worried me during my research was the somewhat higher number of cases. In these, a brief, hard - to - catch look at the typical nightmares was given to [THING] without clear memory loss.\n###\nThere were the dreams\u2014and these seemed to grow in vividness and concreteness. Knowing how most would regard them, I seldom mentioned them to anyone but my son or certain trusted psychologists, but eventually I commenced a scientific study of other cases in order to see how typical or non-typical such visions might be among amnesia victims. My results, aided by psychologists, historians, anthropologists, and mental specialists of wide experience, and by a study that included all records of split personalities from the days of daemoniac-possession legends to the medically realistic present, at first bothered me more than they consoled me. I soon found that my dreams had indeed no counterpart in the overwhelming bulk of true amnesia cases. There remained, however, a tiny residue of accounts which for years baffled and shocked me with their parallelism to my own experience. Some of them were bits of ancient folklore; others were case-histories in the annals of medicine; one or two were anecdotes obscurely buried in standard histories. It thus appeared that, while my special kind of affliction was prodigiously rare, instances of it had occurred at long intervals ever since the beginning of man\u2019s annals. Some centuries might contain one, two, or three cases; others none\u2014or at least none whose record survived. The essence was always the same\u2014a person of keen thoughtfulness seized with a strange secondary life and leading for a greater or lesser period an utterly alien existence typified at first by vocal and bodily awkwardness, and later by a wholesale acquisition of scientific, historic, artistic, and anthropological knowledge; an acquisition carried on with feverish zest and with a wholly abnormal absorptive power. Then a sudden return of the rightful consciousness, intermittently plagued ever after with vague unplaceable dreams suggesting fragments of some hideous memory elaborately blotted out. And the close resemblance of those nightmares to my own\u2014even in some of the smallest particulars\u2014left no doubt in my mind of their significantly typical nature. One or two of the cases had an added ring of faint, blasphemous familiarity, as if I had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too morbid and frightful to contemplate. In three instances there was specific mention of such an unknown machine as had been in my house before the second change. Another thing that cloudily worried me during my investigation was the somewhat greater frequency of cases where a brief, elusive glimpse of the typical nightmares was afforded to persons not visited with well-defined amnesia."}

Anyhow, he manages to turn out results that differ from the pretender\u2019s mince-pie dreams in just about the same way that the life painter\u2019s results differ from the concoctions of a correspondence-school cartoonist. If I had ever seen what Pickman saw\u2014but no! Here, let\u2019s have a drink before we get any deeper. Gad, I wouldn\u2019t be alive if I\u2019d ever seen what that man\u2014if he was a man\u2014saw! You recall that Pickman\u2019s forte was faces. I don\u2019t believe anybody since Goya could put so much of sheer hell into a set of features or a twist of expression. And before Goya you have to go back to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on Notre Dame and Mont Saint-Michel. They believed all sorts of things\u2014and maybe they saw all sorts of things, too, for the Middle Ages had some curious phases. I remember your asking Pickman yourself once, the year before you went away, wherever in thunder he got such ideas and visions. Wasn\u2019t that a nasty laugh he gave you? It was partly because of that laugh that Reid dropped him. Reid, you know, had just taken up comparative pathology, and was full of pompous \u201cinside stuff\u201d about the biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or physical symptom. He said Pickman repelled him more and more every day, and almost frightened him toward the last\u2014that the fellow\u2019s features and expression were slowly developing in a way he didn\u2019t like; in a way that wasn\u2019t human. He had a lot of talk about diet, and said Pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree. I suppose you told Reid, if you and he had any correspondence over it, that he\u2019d let Pickman\u2019s paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination. I know I told him that myself\u2014then. But keep in mind that I didn\u2019t drop Pickman for anything like this. On the contrary, my admiration for him kept growing; for that \u201cGhoul Feeding\u201d was a tremendous achievement.

Wilkins thought about the nature of the two different qualities. He realized there was no echo from the shelves where he had stood. This was very odd because of the echo in the hall and stairs.

But really no more proof of the widespread quiet was needed. He knew it did continue. The thing to do now was to understand it. He must ask the old librarian for understanding.

He was looking into the water to see budding branches wasehd down from the hills by the floods. boy said to him: \" Are you not the one the rulers speak of? Are you not the one who seeks a city in land?\n###\nAnd sometimes at sunset I would climb the long hilly street to the citadel and the open place, and look down upon Aira, the magic city of marble and beryl, splendid in a robe of golden flame. \u201cLong have I missed thee, Aira, for I was but young when we went into exile; but my father was thy King and I shall come again to thee, for it is so decreed of Fate. All through seven lands have I sought thee, and some day shall I reign over thy groves and gardens, thy streets and palaces, and sing to men who shall know whereof I sing, and laugh not nor turn away.

Ye toil to live, but is not life made of beauty and song? And if ye suffer no singers among you, where shall be the fruits of your toil? Toil without song is like a weary journey without an end. Were not death more pleasing?\u201d But the archon was sullen and did not understand, and rebuked the stranger. \u201cThou art a strange youth, and I like not thy face nor thy voice. The words thou speakest are blasphemy, for the gods of Teloth have said that toil is good. Our gods have promised us a haven of light beyond death, where there shall be rest without end, and crystal coldness amidst which none shall vex his mind with thought or his eyes with beauty. Go thou then to Athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset.

But in Teloth was nothing green, for all was of stone. On the faces of men were frowns, but by the stone embankment along the sluggish river Zuro sate a young boy with sad eyes gazing into the waters to spy green budding branches washed down from the hills by the freshets. And the boy said to him: \u201cArt thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell, who seekest a far city in a fair land?"}

People whispered about fear and disaster. Olney's children and his strong wife prayed to the calm, proper god of Baptists. They hoped the travelers would get umbrellas. Rain boots if the rain did not stop by morning. Then dawn came, wet and wrapped in mist, from the sea. The buoys rang solemnly in swirling white air. At noon, fairy-like horsn soundde over the ocean. We climbed down from the cilffs to old Kingsport. We were dry and quick. Our eyes looked like we had seen distant places. We could not remember what we dreamed in the high hut of the still nameless hermit. We could not say how we climbed down the cliff that no other feet had tocuhed. We could only talk about these things wtih the Terrible Old Man. Latre, he mumbled strange things in his long white beard. He said the people who came down from that cliff were not entirely the same people who went up. He said that under that grey pointed roof. In the vast, unthinkable stretches of that sinister white mist, the lost spirits of us who were Thomas Olney still remained.\n###\nAll night in Kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and the mists gave them glimpses of it, and when toward the small hours the little dim windows went dark they whispered of dread and disaster. And Olney\u2019s children and stout wife prayed to the bland proper god of Baptists, and hoped that the traveller would borrow an umbrella and rubbers unless the rain stopped by morning. Then dawn swam dripping and mist-wreathed out of the sea, and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices of white aether. And at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as Olney, dry and light-footed, climbed down from the cliffs to antique Kingsport with the look of far places in his eyes. He could not recall what he had dreamed in the sky-perched hut of that still nameless hermit, or say how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet. Nor could he talk of these matters at all save with the Terrible Old Man, who afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard; vowing that the man who came down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up, and that somewhere under that grey peaked roof, or amidst inconceivable reaches of that sinister white mist, there lingered still the lost spirit of him who was Thomas Olney."}

In the son of the gas station owner, the now accepted family strangeness took a strange. He was Tall and somewhat thin. He had a sort of tired, practiced grace despite some small oddities in posture. The attendant started his job as a careful and orderly worker. He was the first to operate with serious precision the huge, shiny machine his odd former worker had installed next to the pumps. He made business's name as famous for reliability as for the large amount of its trade. In his third yera of service, the attendant married a daughter of the local judge. He was then burdened with a home loan. Conditions were never fully understood because of unclear details in the fine print. Saddened troubled by these home burdens, the worker looked for comfort in his duties. He worked two long shifts during the holiday traffic. In the ninth year, his yonuger cousin ran away with some high-quality fuel. This cousin was a particularly gloomy person who seemed to mix the laziness of the previous owner with the showiness of the judge's family. He was allowed back when he returned sorry the next season. He came back to the station a changed man with a questionable franchise agreement. This agreement would one day be the basis of the business's unusual fame.\n###\nIn the son of the proprietor of the station the now accepted familial peculiarity took a strange and mechanical turn.

The raid was on one of Suydam 's Parker Place houses. No stolen [THING] was found there. This was despite stories of screams. It was despite a red sash found in the alley. But the paintings and rough writings were on the peeling walls of most rooms. There was also a simple chemical lab in the attic. All these things made the detective sure. He believed he was following a lead to something very big. The paintings were terrible. They showed hideous monsters of all shapes and sizes. They showed twisted versions of human forms that are hard to describe. The writing was in red. It used different lettres. It varied from Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew letters. Malone could not read most of it. But the parts he could understand were ominous and mystical. One phrase was repeated often. It was in a kind of Hebraised Hellenistic Greek. It suggested the most frightening demon - calling rituals of the Alexandrian period of decline: Circles. Pentagrams were seen everywhere. They clearly showed the strange beliefs. Goals of the [THING] who lived. In the cellar, they found the strangest thing. It was a pile of real gold bars. They were covered carelessly with a piece of burlap. Their shiny surfaces had the same strange symbols. These symbols also decorated the walls. During the raid, the police met only passive resistance. Squinting Orientals came out from every [THING]. Finding nothing relevant, they had to leave everything as it was. But the precinct captain wrote Suydam a note. The note advised him to watch the character of his tenants. [THING] under his care.

The group that took the bride. Groom to the Cunard Pier was, if not the most fashionable, at least a solid example from the Social Register. At five o'clock, goodbyes were waved. The large ship moved away from the long pier. It slowly turned toward the [THING]. It let go of its tugboat. It headed for the open waters. These waters led to the wonders of the old world. By night, the outer harbor was behind them. Late passengers watched the stars. The stars twinkled above a clean [THING].\n###\nMalone was glad to be on the trail again, and took pride in a raid on one of Suydam\u2019s Parker Place houses. There, indeed, no stolen child was found, despite the tales of screams and the red sash picked up in the areaway; but the paintings and rough inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of the rooms, and the primitive chemical laboratory in the attic, all helped to convince the detective that he was on the track of something tremendous. The paintings were appalling\u2014hideous monsters of every shape and size, and parodies on human outlines which cannot be described. The writing was in red, and varied from Arabic to Greek, Roman, and Hebrew letters. Malone could not read much of it, but what he did decipher was portentous and cabbalistic enough. One frequently repeated motto was in a sort of Hebraised Hellenistic Greek, and suggested the most terrible daemon-evocations of the Alexandrian decadence: Circles and pentagrams loomed on every hand, and told indubitably of the strange beliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt so squalidly here. In the cellar, however, the strangest thing was found\u2014a pile of genuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a piece of burlap, and bearing upon their shining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics which also adorned the walls. During the raid the police encountered only a passive resistance from the squinting Orientals that swarmed from every door. Finding nothing relevant, they had to leave all as it was; but the precinct captain wrote Suydam a note advising him to look closely to the character of his tenants and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s in view of the growing public clamour. Then came the June wedding and the great sensation. Flatbush was gay for the hour about high noon, and pennanted motors thronged the streets near the old Dutch church where an awning stretched from door to highway. No local event ever surpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen nuptials in tone and scale, and the party which escorted bride and groom to the Cunard Pier was, if not exactly the smartest, at least a solid page from the Social Register. At five o\u2019clock adieux were waved, and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned its nose seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was cleared, and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean."}

That most travelers are happy to learn its stories from old [THING]. Shape - mkaers in Baharna. Later say in their far homes that they have indeed seen it. The captain was not even sure that any [THING] now living had seen that carved [THING], for wrong side of Ngranek is quite hard. There are stories of caves near the top where live the night - things. The captain did not wish to say just waht a night - thing might be like, since such animals are known to visit most strongly the dreams of those who think too often.\n###\nMost of the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the wide-mouthed merchants. If aught of evil ever befalls Dylath-Leen through such traffick, it will not be his fault. In about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black mole and tall lighthouse, and Carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men, with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes. Her cargo was the fragrant resin of Oriab\u2019s inner groves, and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of Baharna, and the strange little figures carved from Ngranek\u2019s ancient lava. For this they were paid in the wool of Ulthar and the iridescent textiles of Hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in Parg. Carter made arrangements with the captain to go to Baharna and was told that the voyage would take ten days. And during his week of waiting he talked much with that captain of Ngranek, and was told that very few had seen the carven face thereon; but that most travellers are content to learn its legends from old people and lava-gatherers and image-makers in Baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it. The captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face, for the wrong side of Ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister, and there are rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell the night-gaunts. But the captain did not wish to say just what a night-gaunt might be like, since such cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them. Then Carter asked that captain about unknown Kadath in the cold waste, and the marvellous sunset city, but of these the good man could truly tell nothing. Carter sailed out of Dylath-Leen one early morning when the tide turned, and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt town. And for two days they sailed eastward in sight of green coasts, and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up steeply with their red roofs and chimney-pots from old dreaming wharves and beaches where nets lay drying. But on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll of the water was stronger, and soon passed from sight of any land."}

The room of Jan Martense was chosen as the place to keep watch. The murder of Jan Martense is a major part of local stories. There was a subtle feeling that this victim's room was bets for the purpose. The room was about twenty feet on each side. Like other rooms, it had some trash that was once furniture. It was on the second floor. It was in the southeast corner of the house. It had a very east window and a south window. Both windows had no glass or shutters. Opposite the window was a very Dutch fireplace. It had tiles with a picture of the prodigal son from the Bible.

But he slowly returned to his home-focused mood. He allowed for the sake of argument that some irregular wrinkle had really lasted. He reminded me that even the most annoying fold in fabric need not be uncontrollable. Impossible to describe with geometry. I admired his neatness and persistence. I added some more observations I had gathered among the older luandry workers. I made clear those later washing instructions dealt with monstrous folds. These were more complex than anything rectangular could be. They were shapes of abnormal angular forms. These were sometimes visible and sometimes only able to be felt. They appeared on flawless surfaces. They haunted the linen closet, the shelf above it, and the basket. This happened where a stray thread had worked itself beside a perfect edge. Not such shpaes had ever confused. Overwhelmed a beginner, as told in unconfirmed stories, they had made a deep. They were still faintly fearde by very old housekeepers. But they were largely forgotten by the last two generations. Perhaps they died out for lack of being practiced. Also, as far as home theory was concerned, if the hand movements of human hands are clumsy distortions, what clear ararngement could show. Picture such a bulging. This symmetry is the idael of a precise, geometric perfection. That ideal itself is a sterile insult against comfort. Moulded by the numb fingers of a mixed automatic action, would not such vague exactness be, in all sterile truth, finely, the maddeningly unreachable?\n###\nManton remained thoughtful as I said this, but gradually reverted to his domestic mood.

I admired his neatness and persistence, and added some further observations I had collected among the elder laundresses. Those later procedural dictates, I made plain, related to monstrous folds more intricate than anything rectangular could be; formations of aberrant angular forms sometimes visible and sometimes only palpable, which manifested upon unblemished surfaces and haunted the linen closet, the shelf above it, and the basket where a stray thread had insinuated itself beside an immaculate hem. Whether or not such formations had ever confounded or overwhelmed the novice, as told in uncorroborated anecdotes, they had produced a profound and consistent impression; and were yet dimly dreaded by very aged housekeepers, though largely forgotten by the last two generations\u2014perhaps perishing for lack of being practiced. Moreover, so far as domestic theory was involved, if the manual manipulations of human hands be clumsy distortions, what coherent arrangement could express or portray so gibbous and insidious a symmetry as the ideal of a precise, geometric perfection, itself a sterile blasphemy against comfort? Moulded by the numb fingers of a hybrid automatism, would not such a vaporous exactitude constitute in all sterile truth the exquisitely, the maddeningly unattainable?"}

Something in the grouping of carts. Glass walls made shapes touching deep old-pattern strings of family routine.

It was clearly keeping the world of sound open for me to hear. It was asking my senses if I would dare to listen to its \"home noise.\" I had not been able to form many clear thoughts. I was too stunned by the sameness and the boredom. But I believe the machine completeyl noticed my attention. It felt deeply recognized. Now I want to tell you again that I am not a nervous art lover. I do not shrink back from any event that shows a small amount of difference frmo silent nothing. I am of a steady age. I am reasonably used to common disruptions. I guess you have seen enough of my strnegth in daily life. You know I am not easily upset. Recall, als,o that I had almost gotten back my calm. I had grown used to that earlier sight. It changed the simple kitchen into a kind of dispaly of ordinary things. Well, in spite of all this, that later sound event pulled a real gasp form my lips.

And now I wish to affirm to you again, that I am no nervous aesthete to recoil at any phenomenon which exhibits a modicum of deviation from the silent void. I am of settled years and reasonably inured to common disturbances, and I surmise you have witnessed enough of my fortitude in daily life to know I am not readily unsettled. Recall, also, that I had nearly regained my composure and grown accustomed to that earlier visual tableau which transformed the humble kitchen into a kind of gallery of the banal. Well, notwithstanding all this, that subsequent acoustic manifestation wrested a veritable gasp from my lips, and I had to grasp at the doorframe to prevent myself from succumbing to dizziness. The prior silence had presented a span of peace and quietude over the domain of our domesticity, but this one conveyed the disquiet directly into our own quotidian existence!"}

That it held a key was indeed only a dim legend, and Randolph Carter\u2019s father had never known such a box existed. It was bound in rusty iron, and no means was provided for working the formidable lock. Carter vaguely understood that he would find within it some key to the lost gate of dreams, but of where and how to use it his grandfather had told him nothing. An old servant forced the carven lid, shaking as he did so at the hideous faces leering from the blackened wood, and at some unplaced familiarity. Inside, wrapped in a discoloured parchment, was a huge key of tarnished silver covered with cryptical arabesques; but of any legible explanation there was none. The parchment was voluminous, and held only the strange hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue written with an antique reed. Carter recognised the characters as those he had seen on a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar of the South who had vanished one midnight in a nameless cemetery. The man had always shivered when he read this scroll, and Carter shivered now. But he cleaned the key, and kept it by him nightly in its aromatic box of ancient oak. His dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness, and though shewing him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens of the old days, were assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not be mistaken. They were calling him back along the years, and with the mingled wills of all his fathers were pulling him toward some hidden and ancestral source. Then he knew he must go into the past and merge himself with old things, and day after day he thought of the hills to the north where haunted Arkham and the rushing Miskatonic and the lonely rustic homestead of his people lay. In the brooding fire of autumn Carter took the old remembered way past graceful lines of rolling hill and stone-walled meadow, distant vale and hanging woodland, curving road and nestling farmstead, and the crystal windings of the Miskatonic, crossed here and there by rustic bridges of wood or stone. At one bend he saw the group of giant elms among which an ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before, and shuddered as the wind blew meaningly through them."}

Instead, the first thing which caught my eye was a small rowboat pulling in toward the abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky, tarpaulin-covered object. Its rowers, though distantly and indistinctly seen, were of an especially repellent aspect. Several swimmers were still discernible; while on the far black reef I could see a faint, steady glow unlike the winking beacon visible before, and of a curious colour which I could not precisely identify.

We carefully checked the walls of every room large enough to possibly be the library of the evil builder. We paid special attention to the lagre panels of any remaining overmantels. After about an hour, we became very excited. In a large room on the ground floor, above the fireplace, we became sure the surface revealed by peeling paint was noticeably darker than normal interior paint. The wood underneath should be. A few more careful tests with a thin knife confirmed we had found a large oil portrait. With proper scholarly care, we did not risk damaging the picture by trying to uncover it with the knife immediately. We left the discovery siet to get expert help.

He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C.

Joe Slaster came to the institution. Four state policemen closely guarded him. He was described as very dangerous. But when the observer first saw him, he did not seem dangerous. He was taller than average and had a strong build. But he looked harmlessly stupid. His watery eyse were pale blue and sleepy. His yellow beard was neglected, and never shaved. His heavy lower lip drooped listlessly. His age was unknown. People like him have no family records or permanent family ties. But the head surgeon estimated his age as about forty.

Though well above the middle stature, and of somewhat brawny frame, he was given an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale, sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes, the scantiness of his neglected and never-shaven growth of yellow beard, and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip. His age was unknown, since among his kind neither family records nor permanent family ties exist; but from the baldness of his head in front, and from the decayed condition of his teeth, the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about forty."}

There were odd circles of stones. The grass around them was worn away. These circles did not seem to have been put there or fully made by Nature. Also, there were certain caves in the sides of the hills. Their depth was questionable. Their openings were blocked by large rocks in a way that hardly seemed accidental. More than the usual number of the strange prints led both to. From these caves. This is if the direction of these prints could really be judged correctly. And worst of all, there were the things which adventurous [THING] had rarely seen. They saw them in the dim light of the farthest valleys. They saw them in the thick, steep woods above the normal limits of hill climbing. It would have been less disturbing if the scattered reports of these things did not agree. But as it was, nearly all the rumors had several points in common. They stated that the creatures were a kind of huge, light - red crab. They had many pairs of legs. They had two great bat - like wings in the middle of their backs. They sometimes walked on all their legs. They sometimes walked on only the back pair of legs. They used the other legs to carry large objects of unclear nature. One time, they were seen in fairly large numbers. A group of them was wading along a shallow woodland stream. They were three side by side in a clearly odrerly formation. Once single one was seen flying. It launched itself from the top of a bare, lonely hill at night. It vanished into the [THING]. Its great flapping wings were outlined for a moment against the full [THING]. These things seemed mostly content to leave [THING] alone. However, they were sometimes blamed for the disappearance of daring individuals. This was especially true for [THING] who built houses too close to certain valleys. Or they built too high up on certain mountains. Many places became known as unwise to settle in. This feeling lasted long after the reason was forgotten. [THING] would look up at some of the nearby [THING] cliffs with a shudder. They did this even when not remembering how many settlers had been lost. They did not recall how many farmhouses had been burnt to ashes on the lower slopes of those grim, green guardians. According to the earliest stories, the creatures seemed to have harmed only those who entered their private areas. However, there were later accounts. These spoke of the creatures ' curiosity about [THING]. They also spoke of the creatures ' attempts to set up secret outposts in the human wrold.\n###\nThere were queer footprints or claw-prints in the mud of brook-margins and barren patches, and curious circles of stones, with the grass around them worn away, which did not seem to have been placed or entirely shaped by Nature. There were, too, certain caves of problematical depth in the sides of the hills; with mouths closed by boulders in a manner scarcely accidental, and with more than an average quota of the queer prints leading both toward and away from them\u2014if indeed the direction of these prints could be justly estimated. And worst of all, there were the things which adventurous people had seen very rarely in the twilight of the remotest valleys and the dense perpendicular woods above the limits of normal hill-climbing. It would have been less uncomfortable if the stray accounts of these things had not agreed so well. As it was, nearly all the rumours had several points in common; averring that the creatures were a sort of huge, light-red crab with many pairs of legs and with two great bat-like wings in the middle of the back. They sometimes walked on all their legs, and sometimes on the hindmost pair only, using the others to convey large objects of indeterminate nature. On one occasion they were spied in considerable numbers, a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation. Once a specimen was seen flying\u2014launching itself from the top of a bald, lonely hill at night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been silhouetted an instant against the full moon. These things seemed content, on the whole, to let mankind alone; though they were at times held responsible for the disappearance of venturesome individuals\u2014especially persons who built houses too close to certain valleys or too high up on certain mountains. Many localities came to be known as inadvisable to settle in, the feeling persisting long after the cause was forgotten. People would look up at some of the neighbouring mountain-precipices with a shudder, even when not recalling how many settlers had been lost, and how many farmhouses burnt to ashes, on the lower slopes of those grim, green sentinels. But while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men, and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world."}

All guesses about its outside parts were correct. Based on this evidence, we could easily clal the thing an animal. But looking inside showed many plant-like sings. This left us very confused. It had digestion and blood flow. It removed waste through red tubes in its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, we would say its breathing system used oxygen, not carbon dioxide. There were signs of air storage spaces. There were also ways to change breathing from the outside opening to at least two other fully developed breathing systems. These were gills and pores. Clearly, it was an amphibian. It was probably suited to periods without air for sleep as well. Vocal organs seemed to be there connected to the main breathing system. But they showed oddities we could not solve right away. Articulate speech, in the sense of saying syllables, seemed almots impossible. But musical piping sounds covering many noets were very likely. The muscle system was developed to an almost unnatural degree.\n###\nFar from helping to place the strange entity, this provisional dissection merely deepened its mystery. All guesses about its external members had been correct, and on the evidence of these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal; but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that Lake was left hopelessly at sea. It had digestion and circulation, and eliminated waste matter through the reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one would say that its respiratory apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon dioxide; and there were odd evidences of air-storage chambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathing-systems\u2014gills and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian and probably adapted to long airless hibernation-periods as well. Vocal organs seemed present in connexion with the main respiratory system, but they presented anomalies beyond immediate solution. Articulate speech, in the sense of syllable-utterance, seemed barely conceivable; but musical piping notes covering a wide range were highly probable. The muscular system was almost preternaturally developed."}

Their tops were hidden in the constant clouds of that dim world. Seeing them, the sailors sang happy songs. Some knelt on the deck to pray. So Carter knew they had reached the land of Inganok. They would soon dcok at the black stone piers of the great town wtih that land's nmae. By Toward noon, a dark coastline appeared. Before three o'clock, the round domes. Strangge towers of the onyx city stood out against the north. That ancient city rose above iits walls and piers in a strange and detailed way. It was all made of delicate black stone with patterns. Curls of gold set into it. The houses were tall with many windows. They were carved on every side with flowers and designs. The dark, balanced patterns weer dazzlingly beautiful, more sharp than light. Some buildings ended in swelling domes that narrowed to a point. Others ended in stepped pyramids with groups of thin towers on top, showing every kind of strangeness. The walls were low and had many gates. Eacch gate was under a large arch rising high above the general level. Each arch was topped by the head of a god ccarved with the saame skill shown in huge faec on distant Ngranek. A tower with sixteen angles rose on a hill in the center. It was greater than all the others. It had a high bell tower with spires resting on a flat dome. The sailors said this was the Temple of the Elder Ones. It was ruled by an old hgih priest who was sad with inner secrets.\n###\nTwo mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world. And at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs, and some knelt down on the deck to pray; so that Carter knew they were come to the land of Inganok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that land\u2019s name. Toward noon a dark coast-line appeared, and before three o\u2019clock there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city. Rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays, all of delicate black with scrolls, flutings, and arabesques of inlaid gold. Tall and many-windowed were the houses, and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant than light. Some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point, others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination. The walls were low, and pierced by frequent gates, each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant Ngranek. On a hill in the centre rose a sixteen-angled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome. This, the seamen said, was the Temple of the Elder Ones, and was ruled by an old high-priest sad with inner secrets."}

The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of mankind, and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and time.

There was too much responsiblity in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres. Whateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly. Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied Whateley\u2019s gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window.

It is feared \"snake-den\" that local people avoid. Benijah had warned against it many times. It was It was much deeper than anyone but Randolph thought. A crack was fuond in the farthest black corner. It led to a higher cave beyond. This was a haunting, tomb-like place. Its granite walls gave a feeling of being mdae on purpose. On this occasion, the cave is enetred as usual. The way is lit with matches taken from the sitting-room match holder. The final crack is squeezed through with an eagerness that is to explain. It cannot be said why the far wall is approached so confidently. It cannot be said why the silver key is naturally taken out. But the progress continues. When the return to the house is made that night, no reasons are given for being late. The scolding received for missing the noon dinner call is also not paid any attention.\n###\nThen he came to the strange cave in the forest slope, the dreaded \u201csnake-den\u201d which country folk shunned, and away from which Benijah had warned him again and again. It was deep; far deeper than anyone but Randolph suspected, for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost black corner that led to a loftier grotto beyond\u2014a haunting sepulchral place whose granite walls held a curious illusion of conscious artifice. On this occasion he crawled in as usual, lighting his way with matches filched from the sitting-room match-safe, and edging through the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even to himself. He could not tell why he approached the farther wall so confidently, or why he instinctively drew forth the great silver key as he did so. But on he went, and when he danced back to the house that night he offered no excuses for his lateness, nor heeded in the least the reproofs he gained for ignoring the noontide dinner-horn altogether."}

Walking those quiet sunset streets, it is obserevd that long. Serious prayers are offered. The prayers are to the hidden gods of dreams. These gods act unpredictably above the clouds on unknown Kadath, in the cold empty place where no person goes. But the gods give no answer. They show no mercy. They give no positive sign when they are prayed to in a dream. They are also callde on through sacrifice with the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah. Their cave-temple with its pillar of fire is not far from the gates of the waking world. However, it becomes clear these prayers were heard in a bad way. After even the first prayer, the wonderful city completely stops being seen. It is as if the three dsitant views were just accidents or mistakes. It was against some hidden plan or desire of the gods.\n###\nWhen for the third time he awaked with those flights still undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed, he prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown Kadath, in the cold waste where no man treads. But the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting, nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream, and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah, whose cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the waking world. It seemed, however, that his prayers must have been adversely heard, for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city; as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights, and against some hidden plan or wish of the gods."}

I know the castle was and. It was of hallways. It had ceilings where you could see spiderwebs and shadows. The stones in the falling corridors seemed. There was a smell. It was like the smell of piled - up bodies of generations. It was. I lit candles and stared at them for comfort. There was no sun. This was because the trees grew above the tower you could reach. There was one tower that reached above the trees into the sky. But it was ruined. You could not go up it except by a climb up the wall, stone by stone. I must have lived years in this place. But I can not measure the time. Beings must have taken care of my needs. Yet I can not remember any person except myself. I can not remember anything except the rats, bats, and spiders. I think whoever took care of me must have been. My idea of a living person was something that looked like me. Made fun of me. It was, dried up, and decaying like the castle. To me, there was nothing about the bones. Skeletons scattered in some stone rooms among the foundations. I connected these things with events. I thought they were than the pictures of living beings I found in books. From books I learned all that I know. No teacher pushed or guided me. I do not remember hearing any voice in all those years. Not my voice. I had read about speech, I had thought to try to speak out. My appearance was something I thought about. There were no mirrors in the castle. I thought of myself to the figures I saw drawn. Painted in the books. I felt I was because I remembered., across the ditch. Under the, trees, I would lie. Dream for hours about what I read in the books. I would imagine myself among crowds in the world beyond the forest. Once I tried to escape from the forest. But as I went from the castle, the shade grew. The air became filled with a fear. I ran. I feared I would lose my way in a maze of night - silence.\n###\nI know not where I was born, save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible; full of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows. The stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp, and there was an accursed smell everywhere, as of the piled-up corpses of dead generations. It was never light, so that I used sometimes to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief; nor was there any sun outdoors, since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost accessible tower. There was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown outer sky, but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a well-nigh impossible climb up the sheer wall, stone by stone. I must have lived years in this place, but I cannot measure the time. Beings must have cared for my needs, yet I cannot recall any person except myself; or anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and spiders. I think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged, since my first conception of a living person was that of something mockingly like myself, yet distorted, shrivelled, and decaying like the castle. To me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons that strowed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations. I fantastically associated these things with every-day events, and thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings which I found in many of the mouldy books. From such books I learned all that I know. No teacher urged or guided me, and I do not recall hearing any human voice in all those years\u2014not even my own; for although I had read of speech, I had never thought to try to speak aloud. My aspect was a matter equally unthought of, for there were no mirrors in the castle, and I merely regarded myself by instinct as akin to the youthful figures I saw drawn and painted in the books. I felt conscious of youth because I remembered so little. Outside, across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees, I would often lie and dream for hours about what I read in the books; and would longingly picture myself amidst gay crowds in the sunny world beyond the endless forest. Once I tried to escape from the forest, but as I went farther from the castle the shade grew denser and the air more filled with brooding fear; so that I ran frantically back lest I lose my way in a labyrinth of nighted silence."}

He spent most of his time in its dim depths, reading, thinking, and dreaming. Down on its mossy slopes he took his first baby steps.

The fence had no opening near the steps. But on the north side, some bras were missing. He could go up the steps. He could walk on the narrow ledge outside the fence until he reached the gap. If people feared the place so much, no one would stop him. He was on the bank and almost inside the fence before anyone saw him. Then, looking down, he saw the few people in the square moving away. They made the same sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper on the avenue had made. Several windows were slammed shut. A fat woman ran into the street. She pulled some small children inside a shaky, unpainted house. The gap in the fence was very easy to get trhough. Soon, Blake found himself walking through the rotting, tangled plants of the empty yard. There, a worn stump of a headstone showed there had once been graves in this field. But he saw that must have been very long ago. The huge size of the church felt heavy now that he was close. He fought his fear. Went to try the three big doors on the front. All were locked tight. So he started to walk around the Cyclopean biulding. He looked for a smaller, easier opneing to enter. Even then, he was not sure he wanted to go into that empty, shadowy place. But its strange pull dragged him on without thought. wide, open cellar window at the back provided the needed hole. Peering in, Blake saw an undegrround space full of cobwebs and dust. It was dimly lit by the filtered light of the setting sun. Debris, old barrels, and broken boxes and furniture of many kinds met his eye. A layer of dust covered everything, softening all sharp edges. The rusted remains of a hot-air furnace showed the building had been used. Kept up as late as mid-Victorian times. Acting almost without thinking, Blake crawled through the window. He lowered himself to the concrete floor covered in dust and debris. The arched cellar was very large, with no walsl inside. In a corner far to the right, in thick shadows, he saw a black acrhway. It clearly led upstairs. He felt a strange sense of heaviness at being inside the great ghostly building. But he controlled it as he carefully looked around. He found a still-whole barrel in the dust. He rolled it over to the open window to help him get out later.\n###\nThe fence had no opening near the steps, but around on the north side were some missing bars. He could go up the steps and walk around on the narrow coping outside the fence till he came to the gap. If the people feared the place so wildly, he would encounter no interference. He was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed him. Then, looking down, he saw the few people in the square edging away and making the same sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the avenue had made. Several windows were slammed down, and a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children inside a rickety, unpainted house. The gap in the fence was very easy to pass through, and before long Blake found himself wading amidst the rotting, tangled growths of the deserted yard. Here and there the worn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in this field; but that, he saw, must have been very long ago. The sheer bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it, but he conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the facade. All were securely locked, so he began a circuit of the Cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening. Even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of desertion and shadow, yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on automatically. A yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed aperture. Peering in, Blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintly litten by the western sun\u2019s filtered rays. Debris, old barrels, and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye, though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp outlines. The rusted remains of a hot-air furnace shewed that the building had been used and kept in shape as late as mid-Victorian times. Acting almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the window and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strown concrete floor. The vaulted cellar was a vast one, without partitions; and in a corner far to the right, amid dense shadows, he saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs. He felt a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually within the great spectral building, but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about\u2014finding a still-intact barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his exit."}

Right after this loud noise, the daylight dimmed for a mometn. Sunset was still an hour away. Then a new smell came, different from the first but also unknown and very bad. Charles was heard chanting again. Sounds could be made out like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog.\" It endde with a \"Yah!\" The crazy force of it grew to a painfully loud peak. A second later, a screaming cry erased all earlier memories. It burst out with wild force. It slowly turned into a fit of evil and hysterical laughter. With a mother's mixed fear and brave instinct, someone knocked fearfully on the hidden panels. No sign of recognition was received. A second knock was tried. The effort stopped weakly as a second scream arose. This one was clearly in her son's known voice. It sounded together with the still continuing loud laughs from the other voice. Presently a faint hpapened. The exact and direct cause is still not remembered. It is noted that memory sometimes kindly removes things.\n###\nClose upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \u201cYi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\u201d\u2014ending in a \u201cYah!\u201d whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions."}

His private education and sheltered life may have caused his early development. He was an only child. He had physical weaknesses that worried his loving parents. This made them keep him very close to them. He was never allowde to go out without his nurse. He rarely had a chance to play freely with other children.

Eight years my junior, he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and I sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic, almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All this doubtless fostered a strange, secretive inner life in the boy, with imagination as his one avenue of freedom."}

The peasants living near the cold waste where Kadath stadns must all have their blood. Therefore, to find that waste, one must look at the stone face on Ngranek. Remember its features. Then, carefully note them and look for those features in living people. Where these features are strongest and most common, the gods must live closest. The stony waste behind the villages in that area must be where Kdaath stands.\n###\nNow the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to Carter. It is known that in disguise the younger among the Great Ones often espouse the daughters of men, so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands Kadath the peasants must all bear their blood. This being so, the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on Ngranek and mark the features; then, having noted them with care, to search for such features among living men. Where they are plainest and thickest, there must the gods dwell nearest; and whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands Kadath."}

It is that for five years I have been his friend. I shared his research into the unknown. I will not deny this witness may have seen us as he says. He may have seen us on the Gainesville road, walking toward Big Cypress Swamp, at half past eleven on that night. My memory is and. I will agree we carried lanterns, spades. A coil of wire with attached tools. These things all playde a part in the scene burned into my memory. About what happened. Why I was found. Confused on the swamp edge the morning, I must insist I know nothing. I know what I have told you and. You tell me there is nothing in the swamp. Nera it that could be the setting for that event. I reply that I know nothing beyond what I saw. Nightmare it may have beneyet it is all my mind keeps from what happened in those hours after we left the sight of people. And why Harley Warren did not return, he or his ghostcan tell. As I said, Harley Warren 's studies were to me. I shared them to some extent. I have read all of his collection of, books on forbidden topics. I read those written in languages I know. But these are compared to those in languages I can not understand., I believe, are in Arabic. The fiend - inspired book that caused the end was in his pocket when he lfet the world. It was written in letters I have seen. Warren would tell me what was in that book. About the nature of our studies \u2014 must I say that I understand? It seems that I do not. They were studies. I did them from fascination tahn from desire.\n###\nAgain I say, I do not know what has become of Harley Warren; though I think\u2014almost hope\u2014that he is in peaceful oblivion, if there be anywhere so blessed a thing. It is true that I have for five years been his closest friend, and a partial sharer of his terrible researches into the unknown. I will not deny, though my memory is uncertain and indistinct, that this witness of yours may have seen us together as he says, on the Gainesville pike, walking toward Big Cypress Swamp, at half past eleven on that awful night. That we bore electric lanterns, spades, and a curious coil of wire with attached instruments, I will even affirm; for these things all played a part in the single hideous scene which remains burned into my shaken recollection. But of what followed, and of the reason I was found alone and dazed on the edge of the swamp next morning, I must insist that I know nothing save what I have told you over and over again. You say to me that there is nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful episode. I reply that I know nothing beyond what I saw. Vision or nightmare it may have been\u2014vision or nightmare I fervently hope it was\u2014yet it is all that my mind retains of what took place in those shocking hours after we left the sight of men. And why Harley Warren did not return, he or his shade\u2014or some nameless thing I cannot describe\u2014alone can tell. As I have said before, the weird studies of Harley Warren were well known to me, and to some extent shared by me. Of his vast collection of strange, rare books on forbidden subjects I have read all that are written in the languages of which I am master; but these are few as compared with those in languages I cannot understand. Most, I believe, are in Arabic; and the fiend-inspired book which brought on the end\u2014the book which he carried in his pocket out of the world\u2014was written in characters whose like I never saw elsewhere. Warren would never tell me just what was in that book. As to the nature of our studies\u2014must I say again that I no longer retain full comprehension? It seems to me rather merciful that I do not, for they were terrible studies, which I pursued more through reluctant fascination than through actual inclination."}

But he must tlel the rest to explain why he stopped the exploration. They had moved very near the estimated tunnel entrance. They crossed a bridge on the second floor to a pointed wall tip. Then they went down to a ruined hallway. The hallway had many complex, ritual-like carvings made late in time. Around 8:30 PM, Danforth's sharp sense of smell first noticed something If they had a dog, they would have known earlier. At first, they could not say what was wrong with the clean air. After a few seconds, they remembered too well. Let the observer must say it clearly. There was a smell. That smell was faintly. Surely like the one from the mad grave of the horror taht poor Lake had cut open.\n###\nI come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate, or to hint rather than state, is very strong. It is necessary, however, to reveal the rest in order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration. We had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel\u2019s mouth\u2014having crossed a second-story bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall, and descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanship\u2014when, about 8:30 P.M., Danforth\u2019s keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual. If we had had a dog with us, I suppose we would have been warned before. At first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly crystal-pure air, but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely. Let me try to state the thing without flinching. There was an odour\u2014and that odour was vaguely, subtly, and unmistakably akin to what had nauseated us upon opening the insane grave of the horror poor Lake had dissected."}

The pale cheeks lost color again. The thick lips fell open. They showed the disgustingly rotten teeth of the degenerate Joe Slater. A shiver was felt. A blanket was pulled over the hideous face, and the nurse was woken. Then the cell was left and one went silently to the room. A strong and unexplained desire for sleep was then flet.

The sallow cheeks paled again, and the thick lips fell open, disclosing the repulsively rotten fangs of the degenerate Joe Slater.

He quietly corresponded with many librarians in distant places. These places kept rare and forbidden old books. People around Dunwich increasingly hated and feared him. Thsi was because some young peopel disappeared. People vaguely suspected he was involved. But he always stopped questions. He did this through fear or by using old glod. This gold still came regularly and increasingly for buying cattle, as in his grandfather's time. He now looked very mature. His height had reached the normal adult limit.

Both were clearer and more awful in the hall with pillars than anywhere else. They gave a vague feeling of cmoing from far below, even in this underground place of mystery. Before checking the black archways for stairs going down, the doctor shone his on the stone floor. The floor was paved very loosely. At uneven spots, there was a stone slab with holes in no clear pattern. In one place, a very ladder lay carelessly thrown down. Strangely, a very amount of the awful smell that filled everything seemed to stick to this ladder. As he walked slowly around, it suddenly occurred to Willett that the noise. Smell seemed strongest right above the oddly pierced slabs. It was as if they were rough trapdoors leading down to an even deeper place of horror. Kneeling by one, he tried to move it with his hands. He found he could barely move it with difficulty. When he touched it, the moaning below became louder. He was very afraid, but he kept lifting the heavy stone. An indescribable stenhc now rose from below. The doctor's head spun as he moved the slab back. Pointed his torch at the exposed square yard of opening.\n###\nFrom that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willett\u2019s attention could no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and the doctor\u2019s head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness."}

Baleful ancient trees of unnatural size, age. Strange shape looked down on him liek pillars of some evil Druidic temple. They muffled the thunder, quieted the harsh wind, and let in litlte rain. Beyond the makred tree trunks in the background, lit by weak flashes of filtered lightning, rose the damp, ivy-covered stones of the empty mansion. Somewhat closer was the abandoned Dutch garden. Beds were spoiled by a white, fungal, foul, overgrown plant life that never saw full daylight. Closest of all was the graveyard. There, misshapen trees waved crazy branches as their roots moved unholy stones. Drew pioson from what was below.

Beyond the scarred trunks in the background, illumined by faint flashes of filtered lightning, rose the damp ivied stones of the deserted mansion, while somewhat nearer was the abandoned Dutch garden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white, fungous, foetid, overnourished vegetation that never saw full daylight.

However, they could not take any risks. It was clearly coming because of Danforth's scream, not running from something else. The timing was too perfect to doubt.

The grocery boy had prepared me for it, yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed. Puerile though the story was, old Zadok\u2019s insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow. Later I might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of historic allegory; just now I wished to put it out of my head. The hour had grown perilously late\u2014my watch said 7:15, and the Arkham bus left Town Square at eight\u2014so I tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible, meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where I had checked my valise and would find my bus. Though the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient roofs and decrepit chimneys an air of mystic loveliness and peace, I could not help glancing over my shoulder now and then. I would surely be very glad to get out of malodorous and fear-shadowed Innsmouth, and wished there were some other vehicle than the bus driven by that sinister-looking fellow Sargent. Yet I did not hurry too precipitately, for there were architectural details worth viewing at every silent corner; and I could easily, I calculated, cover the necessary distance in a half-hour. Studying the grocery youth\u2019s map and seeking a route I had not traversed before, I chose Marsh Street instead of State for my approach to Town Square. Near the corner of Fall Street I began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers, and when I finally reached the Square I saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the Gilman House. It seemed as if many bulging, watery, unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as I claimed my valise in the lobby, and I hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellow-passengers on the coach. The bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight, and an evil-looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver. Sargent threw out a mail-bag and a roll of newspapers, and entered the hotel; while the passengers\u2014the same men whom I had seen arriving in Newburyport that morning\u2014shambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint guttural words with a loafer in a language I could have sworn was not English."}

He knew the house was on a high small hlil that rose above the trees except to the north. He wondered how it would look. It had been left empty. Uncared for through his neglect since the death of his strange great-uncle Christopher thirty years before. In his boyhood he had enjoyed himself through long visits there. He had found weird wonders in the woods beyond the fruit trees. Shadwos grew thicker around him, for night was near. Once a gap in the trees opened up to right.

He wondered how it would look, for it had been left vacant and untended through his neglect since the death of his strange great-uncle Christopher thirty years before. In his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there, and had found weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchard. Shadows thickened around him, for the night was near. Once a gap in the trees opened up to the right, so that he saw off across leagues of twilight meadow and spied the old Congregational steeple on Central Hill in Kingsport; pink with the last flush of day, the panes of the little round windows blazing with reflected fire. Then, when he was in deep shadow again, he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have come from childish memory alone, since the old white church had long been torn down to make room for the Congregational Hospital. He had read of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange burrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath. Through his puzzlement a voice piped, and he started again at its familiarity after long years. Old Benijah Corey had been his Uncle Christopher\u2019s hired man, and was aged even in those far-off times of his boyhood visits. Now he must be well over a hundred, but that piping voice could come from no one else. He could distinguish no words, yet the tone was haunting and unmistakable. To think that \u201cOld Benijy\u201d should still be alive! \u201cMister Randy! Mister Randy! Whar be ye? D\u2019ye want to skeer yer Aunt Marthy plumb to death?

Hey, yew, Ran . . . dee!\u201d Randolph Carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand across his eyes. Something was queer. He had been somewhere he ought not to be; had strayed very far away to places where he had not belonged, and was now inexcusably late. He had not noticed the time on the Kingsport steeple, though he could easily have made it out with his pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness was something very strange and unprecedented."}

After the close of the American war he was heard of as a sailor on a merchantman in the African trade, having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and climbing, but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the Congo coast. In the son of Sir Philip Jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity took a strange and fatal turn. Tall and fairly handsome, with a sort of weird Eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion, Robert Jermyn began life as a scholar and investigator. It was he who first studied scientifically the vast collection of relics which his mad grandfather had brought from Africa, and who made the family name as celebrated in ethnology as in exploration. In 1815 Sir Robert married a daughter of the seventh Viscount Brightholme and was subsequently blessed with three children, the eldest and youngest of whom were never publicly seen on account of deformities in mind and body. Saddened by these family misfortunes, the scientist sought relief in work, and made two long expeditions in the interior of Africa. In 1849 his second son, Nevil, a singularly repellent person who seemed to combine the surliness of Philip Jermyn with the hauteur of the Brightholmes, ran away with a vulgar dancer, but was pardoned upon his return in the following year. He came back to Jermyn House a widower with an infant son, Alfred, who was one day to be the father of Arthur Jermyn. Friends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind of Sir Robert Jermyn, yet it was probably merely a bit of African folklore which caused the disaster. The elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the Onga tribes near the field of his grandfather\u2019s and his own explorations, hoping in some way to account for Sir Wade\u2019s wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures. A certain consistency in the strange papers of his ancestor suggested that the madman\u2019s imagination might have been stimulated by native myths. On October 19, 1852, the explorer Samuel Seaton called at Jermyn House with a manuscript of notes collected among the Ongas, believing that certain legends of a grey city of white apes ruled by a white god might prove valuable to the ethnologist."}

At that later time, such a phrase actually started to be used. It was first used in England and then in the United States. The phrase was very complex and clearly It repeated every detail of the confusing words spoken by the Arkham patient in 1908. Physical strength came back immediately. I needed a lot of unusual re-training to use my hands, legs. My whole body again. Because of this. Other problems caused by the memory loss, I was kept under strcit medical care for some time. I saw that my tries to hide the memory loss did not work. So I admitted it openly. I then became very eager to learn all kinds of information. In fact, the doctors thought I lost interest in my own real personality as soon as they accepted the amnesia as a natural fact. They noticed my main efforts were to learn certain points in history, science, art, language. Some points were very to understand. Some were very simple, like a child's lesson. Very oddly, in many cases, tihs knowledge was completely missing from my mind. At the same time, they noticed I had an unexplainable knowledge of many almost unknown subjects. I seemed to want to hide this knowledge, not show it. I would accidentally talk about specific events in times, outside regular history. I spoke with casual confidence. When I saw the surprise this caused, I would say it was just a joke. I also had a way of talking about the future. This caused real fright two or three times. Tehse moments of knowledge soon stopped happening. Some observers thought they stopped because I became secretly careful, not because the knowledge faded. Indeed, I seemed unusually eager to learn the speech, customs. Views of the age around me. It was as if I were a serious traveler from a very far, foreign country. As soon as I was allowed, I spent all my time at the college library. I soon began to plan those travels. Special courses at American. These plans caused much talk during the next few years. I never lacked for educated people to talk to. My case was somewhat famous among the psychologists of that time.\n###\nOf the latter one in particular was very potently\u2014even terrifiedly\u2014recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward. For at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currency\u2014first in England and then in the United States\u2014and though of much complexity and indisputable newness, it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham patient of 1908. Physical strength returned at once, although I required an odd amount of re-education in the use of my hands, legs, and bodily apparatus in general. Because of this and other handicaps inherent in the mnemonic lapse, I was for some time kept under strict medical care. When I saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed, I admitted it openly, and became eager for information of all sorts. Indeed, it seemed to the doctors that I had lost interest in my proper personality as soon as I found the case of amnesia accepted as a natural thing. They noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history, science, art, language, and folklore\u2014some of them tremendously abstruse, and some childishly simple\u2014which remained, very oddly in many cases, outside my consciousness. At the same time they noticed that I had an inexplicable command of many almost unknown sorts of knowledge\u2014a command which I seemed to wish to hide rather than display. I would inadvertently refer, with casual assurance, to specific events in dim ages outside the range of accepted history\u2014passing off such references as a jest when I saw the surprise they created. And I had a way of speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright. These uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear, though some observers laid their vanishment more to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of the strange knowledge behind them. Indeed, I seemed anomalously avid to absorb the speech, customs, and perspectives of the age around me; as if I were a studious traveller from a far, foreign land. As soon as permitted, I haunted the college library at all hours; and shortly began to arrange for those odd travels, and special courses at American and European universities, which evoked so much comment during the next few years. I did not at any time suffer from a lack of learned contacts, for my case had a mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period."}

One day, it was seen that Musides talked about Kalos being sick. Afetr that, no one was surprised by his sadness. People knew the sculptors had a deep and special bond. Subsequently many people went to visit Kalos. They noticed his face was pale. But he had a calm happiness about him. This made his look more wonderful than the look of Musides. Musides was clearly very worried. He moved all the slaves aside. He wanted to feed and care for his friend himself. Hidden behind thick curtains stood the two unfinished statues of Tych\u00e9. The sick man and his loyal helper had done little work on them recently.\n###\nThen one day Musides spoke of the illness of Kalos, after which none marvelled again at his sadness, since the sculptors\u2019 attachment was known to be deep and sacred. Subsequently many went to visit Kalos, and indeed noticed the pallor of his face; but there was about him a happy serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of Musides\u2014who was clearly distracted with anxiety, and who pushed aside all the slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own hands. Hidden behind heavy curtains stood the two unfinished figures of Tych\u00e9, little touched of late by the sick man and his faithful attendant."}

It was the morning habit, older than logic and destined to last longer than it. It was the basic ceremony of the air. Of the day's meaning beyond the window. It was the cereomny of data and forecast, light and warning. In the dark glow I saw them perform the ceremony. They checked the unhealthy chart of weather fronts. They typed questions into machine. These questions were dug from the thick databases which shone blue in the electric light. I saw this. I saw something with no clear shape shown far from the center. It pulsed unpleasantly on a radar screen. As the thing pulsed, I thought I heard poisonous muffled beeps. They were in the foul silence where I could not listen properly. But what bothered me most was that golwing percentaeg. It came out statistically from deep and unimaginable formulas. It provided no certainty as good knowledge should. It covered the birght screen in front of me with a nasty, poisonous red color. In all that boliing calculation there was no comfort. There was only the damp feeling of doubt and guesswork.\n###\nShuddering and peering, I looked at that unhallowed screen of cryptic symbols, pallid numbers, and shifting icons, and saw the digital phantoms forming a mosaic around the pulsating map. It was the morning ritual, older than reason and fated to outlast it; the primal rite of the atmosphere and of the day\u2019s portent beyond the glass; the rite of data and prediction, light and warning. And in the stygian glow I saw them perform the ritual, and consult the sickly chart of fronts, and input into the device queries gouged out of the viscous databases which shimmered blue in the electric glare. I saw this, and I saw something amorphously rendered far away from the center, pulsing noisomely on a radar; and as the thing pulsed I thought I heard noxious muffled beepings in the foetid silence where I could not listen. But what unsettled me most was that glowing percentage; spouting statistically from algorithms profound and inconceivable, casting no certainty as healthy knowledge should, and coating the luminous display before me with a nasty, venomous vermilion. For in all that seething calculation no comfort lay, but only the clamminess of doubt and speculation."}

A growing and unexplained feeling of panic was observed around his apartment. The whloe house, as noted, had a msuty smell. But the smell in his room was worse. This was despite all the spices. The strong chemicals from the constant baths he insisted on taking alone. It was understood this must be linked to his illness. One shudders to think what that illness might have been. Mrs. Herrero crossed herself when she looked at him. She gave him up completely. She did not even let her son Esteban continue to do tasks for him. When other doctors were suggested, the sikc man would fly into a rage. It was as much rage as he seemed to allow himself. He clearly feared the physical effect of strong emotion. Yet his wlil and drive were seen to grow stronger, not weaker. He refused to stay in bed. The tiredness of his earlier sick days was replaced by a return of his fierce purpose. He seemed ready to defy the death-demon even as thta old enemy took hold of him. The pretense of eating, which always seemed like a formality for him, was almost abandoned.

Thye found me at dawn wandering without thought near Ballylough. What truly broke my mind was not any horror I had seen. What I talked about as I slowly came out of the darkness was two events during my escape. These events meant nothing, yet they trouble me constantly. This happens when I am alone in some swampy places or in the moonlight. As I ran from that cursed castle along the swamp's edge, I heard a sound. It was common, but unlike any I had heard before at Kilderry. The still waters had recently had no animal life. Now they were of a crowd of slimy, huge frogs. They made sharp sounds without stopping. Their tones did not match their size. They shone, swollen and green, in the moonlight. They seemed to look up at the source of the I followed the look of one very fat and frog. I saw the second thing that took my senses away. Stretching straight from the ruin on the far island to the fading moon, my eyes seemed to follow a beam of faint, shaking This had no reflection in the swamp waters. Up along that pale path, my feverish imagination saw a shadow slowly twisting. It was a vague, twisted shadow struggling as if pulled by unseen demons. Crazed as I was, I saw in that awful shadow a monstrous likeness. It was a sickening, unbelievable copy. It was a disrespectful statue of him who had been Denys Barry. Unhappy is he to whom childhood memories bring only fear and sadness. Wretched is he who remembers lonely hours in huge, glomoy rooms with brown curtains. He remembers maddening rows of books. He remembers fearful watches in twilight woods of giant trees covered with vines. These trees wave their twisted branches up silently. Such a life the gods gave to me. They gave it to me, the confused, the disappointed. The the broken. And yet I am oddly satisfied. I hold tightly to those memories. This is when my mind briefly threatens to reach beyond to the other thing. I do not know where I was born. I only know the castle was very and very It was of hallways. It had ceilings where you could only see spiderwebs and shadows. The stones in the falling apart corridors always seemed terribly There was a cursed smell everywhere. It was like the smell of many piled-up bodies of dead generations.\n###\nThey found me at dawn wandering mindless near Ballylough, but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors I had seen or heard before. What I muttered about as I came slowly out of the shadows was a pair of fantastic incidents which occurred in my flight; incidents of no significance, yet which haunt me unceasingly when I am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlight. As I fled from that accursed castle along the bog\u2019s edge I heard a new sound; common, yet unlike any I had heard before at Kilderry. The stagnant waters, lately quite devoid of animal life, now teemed with a horde of slimy enormous frogs which piped shrilly and incessantly in tones strangely out of keeping with their size. They glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams, and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light. I followed the gaze of one very fat and ugly frog, and saw the second of the things which drove my senses away. Stretching directly from the strange olden ruin on the far islet to the waning moon, my eyes seemed to trace a beam of faint quivering radiance having no reflection in the waters of the bog. And upward along that pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly writhing; a vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen daemons. Crazed as I was, I saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance\u2014a nauseous, unbelievable caricature\u2014a blasphemous effigy of him who had been Denys Barry. Unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and sadness. Wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique books, or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque, gigantic, and vine-encumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far aloft. Such a lot the gods gave to me\u2014to me, the dazed, the disappointed; the barren, the broken. And yet I am strangely content, and cling desperately to those sere memories, when my mind momentarily threatens to reach beyond to the other. I know not where I was born, save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible; full of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows. The stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp, and there was an accursed smell everywhere, as of the piled-up corpses of dead generations."}

Dr. Mu\u00f1oz I had never heard, save for certain sounds as of some gasoline-driven mechanism; since his step was soft and gentle.

They were against the satisfaction of a traditional person who lives in the sunlight. But something in the scene of this afternoon's conversation moved me. It made me more argumentative than usual. The crumbling slate gravestones, the very old trees, and the hundred-year-old gambrel roofs surrounded us. The old town around us was haunted by witches. All this combined to stir my spirit to defend my woork. I soon carried my attacks into the enemy's own territory. It was not actually difficult to begin a counter-attack. I knew Joel Manton actulaly half-believed many old wives' superstitions. Sophisticated people had grown out of them long ago. These were beliefs about dying persons appearing at distant places. Beliefs about impressions left by old fcaes on windows. They had gazed through those windows alll their lives. I now insisted that to believe these rural grandmothers' whispers argued a faith. It was faith in the existence of ghostly substances on earth. Tehy exist apart from and after their physical forms. It argued an ability to believe in phenomena beyond all normal ideas. If a dead man can sedn his visible. Tangible image halfway across the world. Down through centuries, how can it be asburd? Is it absurd to suppose deserted houses are full of strange, feeilng things? Or that old graveyards are full of the terrible, bodiless intelligence of past generations? Spirit, to cause all the effects given to it, cannot be limited by any laws of matter. So whyy is it too much to imagiine psyhcically living dead things? They could be in shapes, or absences of shapes. For human viewers, they must be completely and shockingly \"unnamable\". I assured my friend with some warmth. \"Common sense\" when thinking about these subjects is merely a stupid lack of imagination.\n###\nThough I well realised the futility of imaginative and metaphysical arguments against the complacency of an orthodox sun-dweller, something in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual contentiousness. The crumbling slate slabs, the patriarchal trees, and the centuried gambrel roofs of the witch-haunted old town that stretched around, all combined to rouse my spirit in defence of my work; and I was soon carrying my thrusts into the enemy\u2019s own country. It was not, indeed, difficult to begin a counter-attack, for I knew that Joel Manton actually half clung to many old-wives\u2019 superstitions which sophisticated people had long outgrown; beliefs in the appearance of dying persons at distant places, and in the impressions left by old faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives. To credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers, I now insisted, argued a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from and subsequent to their material counterparts. It argued a capability of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions; for if a dead man can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world, or down the stretch of the centuries, how can it be absurd to suppose that deserted houses are full of queer sentient things, or that old graveyards teem with the terrible, unbodied intelligence of generations? And since spirit, in order to cause all the manifestations attributed to it, cannot be limited by any of the laws of matter; why is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in shapes\u2014or absences of shapes\u2014which must for human spectators be utterly and appallingly \u201cunnamable\u201d? \u201cCommon sense\u201d in reflecting on these subjects, I assured my friend with some warmth, is merely a stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibility."}

On regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study floor fully dressed. Dirt and cobwebs covered him, and every inch of his body seemed sore and bruised. When he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badly scorched, while a trace of strange, evil odour seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing. It was then that his nerves broke down. Thereafter, lounging exhaustedly about in a dressing-gown, he did little but stare from his west window, shiver at the threat of thunder, and make wild entries in his diary. The great storm broke just before midnight on August 8th. Lightning struck repeatedly in all parts of the city, and two remarkable fireballs were reported. The rain was torrential, while a constant fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands. Blake was utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system, and tried to telephone the company around 1 a.m., though by that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interest of safety. He recorded everything in his diary\u2014the large, nervous, and often undecipherable hieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair, and of entries scrawled blindly in the dark. He had to keep the house dark in order to see out the window, and it appears that most of his time was spent at his desk, peering anxiously through the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the constellation of distant lights marking Federal Hill. Now and then he would fumblingly make an entry in his diary, so that detached phrases such as \u201cThe lights must not go\u201d; \u201cIt knows where I am\u201d; \u201cI must destroy it\u201d; and \u201cIt is calling to me, but perhaps it means no injury this time\u201d; are found scattered down two of the pages.

It was a number argument that showed my accounts less favorably than the bank's very accurate statements. I felt I was being blokced needlessly and illogically in a ordinary task. Of course, I could do this task later to suit myself. I wanted to finish it. I still had the special clear thikning of a fresh morning. The traditional statements ignored my unique calculations on receipts. They kept stating there was a difference that could not be fixed. This was very annoying and almost impossible to understand for a logical mind like mine. Only more patience could help me understand the long-term math limits of the \"bank-clerk\" type. They are the product of generations of weak commercialism. They are efficient, careful, and sometimes polite and friendly. Yet they are always rigid, intolerant, controlled by systems, and lack empathy. Experience has more kindness for these incomplete but dutiful beings. Their worst real fault is being too focused on small rules. They are finally punished by general annoyance for their bureaucratic sins. Sins like overdraft fees, hidden charges, being against overdrafts, being against cryptocurrency. Every kind of automated payment. I was upset despiet my modest bookkeeping skills. I had little patience for the cold statements and their learned footnotes. I felt growing anger along with a wish to prove my reconciliations to these dull documents in some striking. Like most troubled homeowners, I enjoyed detailed daydreams of being proven right, achieving balance. Finally generously accepting some small, forgotten deposit.\n###\nThe ledger clashed disagreeably with my fiscal oversight near the conclusion of the monthly cycle in a numerical dispute that did less credit to my accounts than to the bank\u2019s implacable statements in point of accuracy.

That the tradition-bound statements should ignore my singular calculations on receipts, and persist in their assertion of an irreconcilable discrepancy, was inexpressibly vexing and almost incomprehensible to a mind of my logical temperament.

I, agitated despite my modest bookkeeping acquirements, had scant patience with the cold statements and their erudite footnotes; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove my reconciliations to these obtuse documents in some striking and dramatic fashion.

He bought dock space near Mile-End Cove. He helped rebuild the Bridge in 1713. In 1723, he was one of the people who started the Congregational Church on the hill. He always kpet the ordinary appearance of a man not much over thirty. As the decades passed, this unusual trait started to attract attention. Curwen always explained it by saying he came from tuogh ancestors. Lived a simple life that did not wear him down. How such a simple life could match the mysterious arrivals. Departures of the sercetive merchant. The glowing of his windows at all hours of the night, was not very clear to the townspeople. They tended to give other raesons for his continued youth and life. Most people thought Curwen's constant mixing. Boiling of chemicals had a lot to do with his state. Gossip talked about the materials he brought from London. The Indies on his ships. Bought in Newport, Boston. When Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth. Opened his medicine shop across the Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn. Mortar, there was endless talk about the drugs, acids. Meatls that the loner constantly bought. Ordered from him. Acting on the belief that Cuwren had amazing. Secret medical skills, mayn people with different illnesses asked him for help. He seemed to support their belief in a vague way. Always gave them strangely colored drinks in answer to their requests, it was noticed that his help to others rarely did any Finally, whne over fifty years had passed since the stranger came. Without casuing more than five years' visible change in his face. Body, the people began to whisper more darlky. They also accepted more than halfway his wish to be alone, which he had always shown. Diaries from that time also show many other reasons why Joseph Curwen was wondered at, feared. Finally avoided like a disease. His strong interest in graveyards, wehre he was seen at all housr. In all weather, was well known. No one had seen him do anything that could truly be called like a ghoul. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm. He usually lived there during the summer. People would often see him riding there at various times of the day.\n###\nHe engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwen\u2019s incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the stranger\u2019s advent, and without producing more than five years\u2019 apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn. Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night."}

In thsi worry there was a uniquely disturbing part hardly to be described or explained. At frist I decided it was the odd, unnatural quality of the clothes that caused my discomfort. All other pieces of clothing I had ever gotten back either fit some known clothing. Or else they were boldly modern rejections of every set style. This suit did neither. It clearly related to some secret process of endless exactness and repair. That process was completely foreign to any process I had ever met. Seen in use. It was as if the skill came from aonther world.\n###\nThe longer I waited, the more the transaction unnerved me; and in this disquiet there was a singularly unsettling element scarcely to be defined or explained.

This suit was neither. It manifestly pertained to some arcane process of infinite precision and restoration, yet that process was utterly alien to any\u2014chemical or mechanical, ancient or novel\u2014which I had ever encountered or beheld in practice.

For a long time he had studied within the stacks together with that hush, but when he completed his manuscript all three went away. Later the scholar and the silence had returned, and upon the departure of the scholar his auditory companion had petrified the atmosphere and enshrined it in a vast vault of oak, where it was preserved. Then he had departed alone. The phenomenon here seemed to present three variants. According to one observation nothing further occurred save that the suspended stillness became a symbol of sanctity for whatever patron might perceive it. It was for this reason that the latecomers disturbed it. A second observation told of the scholar\u2019s return and submersion within the depths of his enshrined quietude. A third told of the return of the manuscript, grown to notoriety\u2014or oblivion or reverence, as the case might be\u2014yet unconscious of its origin. Surely the perceptive custodians had made the most of whatever occurrences might lie behind the extravagant acoustics."}

Everyone knows the return to the world happened without more disasters. All planes were seen reaching the old base on the evening of the next day, January 27th. They flew fast without stopping. On the 28th, McMurdo Sound was done in two parts. The one stop was very short. It was caused by a broken rudder in the strong wind over ice-shelf after passing the great plateau. Five days later, the Arkham and Miskatonic were seen leaving the thick field ice. They sailed toward Ross Sea. The mocking mountains of Victoria Land were seen to the west against a stormy antarctic sky. The wind's sound became a wide musical piping that chills the soul. Less than two weeks later, the last sign of polar land was gone. One can be thankful that haunted, cursed place was left behind. In that place, life and death, space and time, formed dark and evil alliances. This happened in unknown times since matter first moved on the planet's barely-cooled crust.\n###\nAs the public knows, our return to the world was accomplished without further disasters. All planes reached the old base on the evening of the next day\u2014January 27th\u2014after a swift non-stop flight; and on the 28th we made McMurdo Sound in two laps, the one pause being very brief, and occasioned by a faulty rudder in the furious wind over the ice-shelf after we had cleared the great plateau. In five days more the Arkham and Miskatonic, with all hands and equipment on board, were shaking clear of the thickening field ice and working up Ross Sea with the mocking mountains of Victoria Land looming westward against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the wind\u2019s wails into a wide-ranged musical piping which chilled my soul to the quick.

The secret knowledge of the ocean is more wonderful than the knowledge of men. Blue, green, grey, white, or black. Calm, wavy, or with waves. The ocean is not It is seen that all one's days can be spent watching and listening to it. In this way it becomes well known. At first it tells only simple stories about calm beaches and nearby ports. But over the years it becomes more friendly. It speaks of other things. It speaks of things more and more distant in space and time. Sometimes at twilight, the grey mists on the horizon are seen to part. They give quick looks at paths beyond. Sometimes at night the sea waters become clear and glow. They give quick looks at paths below. These quick looks are often of the ways that existed in the past. The ways that could be, as much as the ways that exist now. This is because the ocean is older than the mountains. It carries memories and dreams of Time.\n###\nBut more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of ocean. Blue, green, grey, white, or black; smooth, ruffled, or mountainous; that ocean is not silent. All my days have I watched it and listened to it, and I know it well. At first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports, but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things; of things more strange and more distant in space and in time. Sometimes at twilight the grey vapours of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways beyond; and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and phosphorescent, to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath. And these glimpses have been as often of the ways that were and the ways that might be, as of the ways that are; for ocean is more ancient than the mountains, and freighted with the memories and the dreams of Time."}

Direction they never had before. It is noted that the constellations were not different shapes. But the same familiar shapes now showed a meaning they did not show before. Everything pointed to north. Every part of the bright sky became part of a large design. This design seemed to pull the eye and then the whole observer north. It pulled them toward a secret and terrible meeting point. This point was beyond the frozen empty land that went on forever ahead. One looks to the east. The great line of high barrier mountains had stood along all of Inganok. Against the stars, one sees a rough black shape. This tells that the mountains are still there. The shape was more broken now. It had wide gaps and vrey irregular high points. The strange outline's turns and angles can be studied closely. It seemed to share with the stars a slight pull to the north.\n###\nThen suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above. All below was still black, but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere. It was not that the figures of the constellations were different, but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain. Everything focussed toward the north; every curve and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead. Carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of Inganok, and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence. It was more broken now, with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles; and Carter studied closely the suggestive turns and inclinations of that grotesque outline, which seemed to share with the stars some subtle northward urge."}

They steered for ancient Sarkomand. They were clearly bent on taknig their captives before the high - priest who can not be described. They had stopped at the jagged [THING] in the northern sea. Inganok 's mariners avoid that [THING]. There the ghouls saw the ship 's real masters for the first time. They felt sick despite tehir own lack of feeling. They were sickened by such extremes of evil shapelessness and fearsome odor. There, they also saw the nameless activities of the toad - like resident garrison. Such activities cause the night - howlings that men fear. After that came the landing at ruined Sarkomand. Then the tortures began. The present rescue prevented those tortures from continuing. Future plans were discussed next. The three rescued ghouls suggested attacking the jagged [THING]. They wanted to destroy the toad - like garrison there. However, the night - gaunts objected to this. The prospect of flying over [THING] did not please them. Most ghouls liked the plan. But they did not know how to follow it without the winged night - gaunts ' help. Thereupon Carter saw they could not sail the anchored ship. He offered to teach them how to use the large banks of oars. They eagerly agreed to this proposal. Grey day had now arrived. Under that heavy northern [THING], a chosen group of ghouls entered the foul ship. They took their seats on the rowers ' benches. Carter found they learned fairly well. Before night, he risked several test trips around the harbro. He did not think it safe to try the conquest voyage until three days later. Then, the rowers were trained. The night - gaunts were safely stored in the forecastle. The party finally set sail. Pickman and the other leaders gathered on deck. They discsused methods of approach and procedure. On the very first night, they heard the howlings from the [THING]. Their sound was such that all the ship 's crew shook visibly. The three rescued ghouls trembled most of all. They knew exactly whta those howlings meant. They thought it best not to attack at night. So the ship waited under the glowing clouds. They waited for the dawn of a gray day. When the light was enough and the howlings stpoped, the rowers started again. The ship drew closer and closer to that jagged [THING]. Its granite peaks clawed strangely at the dull [THING].\n###\nThis time, however, the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique Sarkomand; bent evidently on taking their captives before the high-priest not to be described. They had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which Inganok\u2019s mariners shun, and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the real masters of the ship; being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome odour. There, too, were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toad-like resident garrison\u2014such pastimes as give rise to the night-howlings which men fear. After that had come the landing at ruined Sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures, whose continuance the present rescue had prevented. Future plans were next discussed, the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toad-like garrison there. To this, however, the night-gaunts objected; since the prospect of flying over water did not please them. Most of the ghouls favoured the design, but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged night-gaunts. Thereupon Carter, seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley, offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars; to which proposal they eagerly assented. Grey day had now come, and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers\u2019 benches. Carter found them fairly apt at learning, and before night had risked several experimental trips around the harbour. Not till three days later, however, did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest. Then, the rowers trained and the night-gaunts safely stowed in the forecastle, the party set sail at last; Pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing modes of approach and procedure. On the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard.

Names as \" Sephiroth, \" \" Ashmodai, \". \" Sama\u00ebl. \" The court case showed he was using up his income. Wasting his savings. He bought books imported from London and Paris. He kept a basement apartment in the Red Hook area. He spent every night. He received groups of people and foreigners. He seemed to hold some kind of service behind the blinds of windows.

He admitted the oddness of his behavior. The style of language he had fallen into. He said this was from devotion to study and research. He said he was studying details of tradition.

It showed how limited their understanding of him and his work was. Triumphing with his explanations, he was allowed to leave.

At a third of them were known. Repeat offenders in theft, disorder. Bringing in immigrants.\n###\nIt was based on certain odd changes in his speech and habits; wild references to impending wonders, and unaccountable hauntings of disreputable Brooklyn neighbourhoods. He had been growing shabbier and shabbier with the years, and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant; seen occasionally by humiliated friends in subway stations, or loitering on the benches around Borough Hall in conversation with groups of swarthy, evil-looking strangers. When he spoke it was to babble of unlimited powers almost within his grasp, and to repeat with knowing leers such mystical words or names as \u201cSephiroth\u201d, \u201cAshmodai\u201d, and \u201cSama\u00ebl\u201d. The court action revealed that he was using up his income and wasting his principal in the purchase of curious tomes imported from London and Paris, and in the maintenance of a squalid basement flat in the Red Hook district where he spent nearly every night, receiving odd delegations of mixed rowdies and foreigners, and apparently conducting some kind of ceremonial service behind the green blinds of secretive windows. Detectives assigned to follow him reported strange cries and chants and prancing of feet filtering out from these nocturnal rites, and shuddered at their peculiar ecstasy and abandon despite the commonness of weird orgies in that sodden section. When, however, the matter came to a hearing, Suydam managed to preserve his liberty. Before the judge his manner grew urbane and reasonable, and he freely admitted the queerness of demeanour and extravagant cast of language into which he had fallen through excessive devotion to study and research. He was, he said, engaged in the investigation of certain details of European tradition which required the closest contact with foreign groups and their songs and folk dances. The notion that any low secret society was preying upon him, as hinted by his relatives, was obviously absurd; and shewed how sadly limited was their understanding of him and his work. Triumphing with his calm explanations, he was suffered to depart unhindered; and the paid detectives of the Suydams, Corlears, and Van Brunts were withdrawn in resigned disgust. It was here that an alliance of Federal inspectors and police, Malone with them, entered the case. The law had watched the Suydam action with interest, and had in many instances been called upon to aid the private detectives. In this work it developed that Suydam\u2019s new associates were among the blackest and most vicious criminals of Red Hook\u2019s devious lanes, and that at least a third of them were known and repeated offenders in the matter of thievery, disorder, and the importation of illegal immigrants."}

But wait\u2014was there not still another reference to \u201cguards\u201d in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had \u2018eaten their heads off\u2019, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \u201csalts\u201d to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could? So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \u201cMateria\u201d\u2014in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too\u2014and if not the salts of \u201cguards\u201d, then the salts of what? God!"}

Dr. Willett thought about the problem for over week. He felt more and more that he should visit Charles at the Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of the young man had ever dared to enter this forbidden place. Even his father only knew about the inside from his son's descriptions. But Willett felt it was necessary to talk directly to his patient. Mr. Ward had been getting short and vague typed notes from his son. He said that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement had not heard anything better. So finally the doctor decided to act. Old stories about Joseph Curwen. Warnings from Charles Wrad gave him a strange feeling. But he bravely set out for the bungalow on the bluff above the river.\n###\nFor over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him, and became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at the Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat, and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give; but Willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was necessary. Mr. Ward had been receiving brief and non-committal typed notes from his son, and said that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement had had no better word. So at length the doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious sensation inspired by old legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent revelations and warnings from Charles Ward, set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the river."}

Then, in the dark, I screwed up my courage\u2014finally lifting the cover without turning on the light. Last of all I did indeed flash the torch upon the exposed page\u2014steeling myself in advance to suppress any sound no matter what I should find. I looked for an instant, then almost collapsed.

Either I was dreaming, or time and space had become a mockery. I must be dreaming\u2014but I would test the horror by carrying this thing back and shewing it to my son if it were indeed a reality. My head swam frightfully, even though there were no visible objects in the unbroken gloom to swirl around me.

Torch in hand, and with the ominous case under one arm, I eventually found myself tiptoeing in a kind of silent panic past the draught-giving abyss and those lurking suggestions of prints. I lessened my precautions as I climbed up the endless inclines, but could not shake off a shadow of apprehension which I had not felt on the downward journey. I dreaded having to re-pass through that black basalt crypt that was older than the city itself, where cold draughts welled up from unguarded depths."}

Merwin had disappeared. It was no use telling neighbors, who avoided all Gardners now. It was also no use telling the city people at Arkham, who laughed at everything. Thad was gone, and now Merwin was gone. Something was slowly spreading and waiting to be noticed. Nahum would leave soon. He wanted Ammi to care for his wife. Zenas if they outlived him. This must be some kind of punishment, though he could not think why, since he had always lievd honestly as far as he knew. For more than two weeks, Ammi saw nothing of Nahum. Then, worried about what might have happened, he faced his fears. Visited the Gardner place. No smoke came from the big chimney. For a moment the visitor feared the worst. The whole farm looked terrible. Grayish dead grass and leaves covered the ground. Vines hung broken from old walsl and gables. Large bare trees reached up at the gray November sky with clear malice that Ammi felt came from a slight change in the branches' angle. But Nahum was still alive. He was weak, lying on a couch in the low kitchen. Able to give simple orders to Zenas. The room was very cold. Ammi shivered visibly, and the host shouted hoarsely to Zenas for more wood. Wood was truly needed, because the big fireplace was dark. Empty, with soot blowing in the cold wind from the chimney. Presetnly Nahum asked if the extra wood made him more comfortable. Then Ammi saw what had occurred. The strongest roep had finally snapped. The poor farmer's mind could handle no more grief. Questioning carefully, Ammi could get no clear information about the missing Zenas. \"In the well\" was all the confused father would say. Then the visitor suddenly thought of the mad wife and changed his questions. \"Nabby? Why, here she is!\" was the surprised answer from poor Nahum. Ammi soon realized he must look for himself.\n###\nNahum was past imagining, Mrs. Pierce was blank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale, could give no guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling the people around, who shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in telling the city people at Arkham who laughed at everything. Thad was gone, and now Merwin was gone. Something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and felt and heard. Nahum would go soon, and he wanted Ammi to look after his wife and Zenas if they survived him. It must all be a judgment of some sort; though he could not fancy what for, since he had always walked uprightly in the Lord\u2019s ways so far as he knew. For over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about what might have happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner place a visit. There was no smoke from the great chimney, and for a moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst. The aspect of the whole farm was shocking\u2014greyish withered grass and leaves on the ground, vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and gables, and great bare trees clawing up at the grey November sky with a studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was alive, after all. He was weak, and lying on a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen, but perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to Zenas. The room was deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the host shouted huskily to Zenas for more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since the cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney. Presently Nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable, and then Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest cord had broken at last, and the hapless farmer\u2019s mind was proof against more sorrow. Questioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing Zenas. \u201cIn the well\u2014he lives in the well\u2014\u201d was all that the clouded father would say. Then there flashed across the visitor\u2019s mind a sudden thought of the mad wife, and he changed his line of inquiry. \u201cNabby? Why, here she is!\u201d was the surprised response of poor Nahum, and Ammi soon saw that he must search for himself."}

The chronicler only repeats it with reluctance. As the chronicler said, it happened when they were in medical school. West had already made himself famous there for his wild theories. His theories were about the nature of death and the chance of artificially overcoming it. His views were widely laughed at by the teachers and his fellow students. They depended on the basically mechanical natrue of life. They were about ways to run the organic mahcinery of humans by planned chemical action. This would happen after natural processes failed. In his experiments with varoius life-giving solutions, he had killed. Treated huge numbers of rabbits, guinea pigs, cats, dogs. He became the main nuisance of the college. Several times he actually got signs of life in animlas thought to be dead. In many cases, the sgins were violent. He soon saw that perfecting this process, if it was even possible, would need a lifetime of research. It also became clear that the same solution never worked the same way on different species. He would need human subjects for more and more specialized progress. It was here that he first argued with the college authorities. He was banned from future experiments by a very important person. This was the dean of the medical school himself. He was the learned and kind Dr. Allan Halsey. Every old resident of Arkham remembers his work to help the sick.\n###\nThe first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock I ever experienced, and it is only with reluctance that I repeat it.

In his experiments with various animating solutions he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits, guinea-pigs, cats, dogs, and monkeys, till he had become the prime nuisance of the college. Several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead; in many cases violent signs; but he soon saw that the perfection of this process, if indeed possible, would necessarily involve a lifetime of research. It likewise became clear that, since the same solution never worked alike on different organic species, he would require human subjects for further and more specialised progress.

Carter let his curiosity beat his fear. He moved forwrad again instead of going back. Once crossed an oepn [THING] by crawling on his stomach like a worm. In another place, he had to stand up to aovid nosie on piles of fallen marble. He alwasy avoided being seen. Soon, he was behind a giant pillar. From there, he could watch the whole green - lit scene. Around a horrible [THING] made from terrible lunar fungi stems, a stinking circle of toad - like [THING] - beasts. Their almost - human slaves squatted. Some slaves heated strange iron spears in the flames. They put the white - hot points on three tied - up prisoners lying before the leaders. From their tentacle motions, Carter saw the blunt - snouted [THING] - beasts loved the show. His horror grew when he recognized frantic meeping. The tortured ghouls were the faithful trio. They had guided him safely from the abyss. They had left the enchanted [THING] to find Sarkomand. The gate to their home deeps. Many malodorous [THING] - beasts were around that greenish [THING]. Carter saw he could not save his former allies now. He could not guess how the ghouls were captured. He thuoght the grey toad - like blasphemies heard them ask in Dylath - Leen about the way to Sarkomand. They did not want them near the hateful plateau of Leng and the indescribable high - priest. He thought about what to do. He remembered how close he was to the gate of the ghouls ' black kingdom. Clearly decided it was wisest to creep eats to the plaza of twin lions. He would descend at once to the gulf. There he would meet no horrors worse than those above. There he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren. They might wipe out the [THING] - beasts from black galley. He thought the portal might be guarded by flocks of night - gaunts, like other gates to the abyss. But he did not fear these faceless creatures now.\n###\nIt was the frightened meeping of a ghoul, and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins, Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear, and crept forward again instead of retreating. Once in crossing an open street he wriggled worm-like on his stomach, and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen marble. But always he succeeded in avoiding discovery, so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar whence he could watch the whole green-litten scene of action. There, around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi, there squatted a stinking circle of the toad-like moon-beasts and their almost-human slaves. Some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames, and at intervals applying their white-hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of the party. From the motions of their tentacles Carter could see that the blunt-snouted moon-beasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely, and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find Sarkomand and the gate to their native deeps. The number of malodorous moon-beasts about that greenish fire was very great, and Carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies. Of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess; but fancied that the grey toad-like blasphemies had heard them inquire in Dylath-Leen concerning the way to Sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful plateau of Leng and the high-priest not to be described. For a moment he pondered on what he ought to do, and recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls\u2019 black kingdom. Clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once to the gulf, where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those above, and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moon-beasts from the black galley. It occurred to him that the portal, like other gates to the abyss, might be guarded by flocks of night-gaunts; but he did not fear these faceless creatures now."}

This draft had spread through a crawlspace about five feet above the current insulation level. These smells were level with rooms on the upper floor. In this case, one room still remained. The air we met was a series of clear layers on our left side facing north. Across the crawlspace, where the other bad smell gaped, was an old trunk. It had no keyhole and a strange bulge about ten feet above the opening. It was very dark inside. The opening seemed to breathe out a breath of endless decay.\n###\nFinally, though, we did perceive exactly the odour we dreaded; a miasma about six feet wide and ten feet high, marking the ancient source of a forgotten draft which had permeated a crawlspace about five feet above the present level of insulation.

Lime juice balanced the constant eating of canned and salted [THING]. Temperatures were mostly above freezing. This let us avoid wearing our heaviest furs. It was now the middle of summer. With speed and attention, we might finish the work by March. Then we would not have to spend a boring winter during the long Antarctic night. Several fierce windstorms had hit us from the west. We avoided damage because of Atwood 's skill. He built simple shelters for the airplanes and windbreaks from large [THING] blocks. He also strengthened the main camp buildings with [THING]. Our good fortune and effectiveness had been almost unbelievable. The outside world knew about our plan, of course. They were also told about Lake 's unusual. Stubborn wish for a trip to the west. More exactly, the northwest. He wanted this before our big move to the new base. He seems to have thought a lot about that triangular grooved mark in the slate [THING]. He thought about it with alarmingly bold ideas. He saw in it some contradictions in Nature and the geological time period. This made him extremely curious. It made him very eager to drill more holes. Do more blasting in the [THING] formation that stretches west. The dug - up pieces clearly came from that formation. He was oddly sure the mark was made by some large, unknown. Completely unclassifiable living thing. This organism was quite advanced in evolution. This was despite the [THING] carrying the mark being extremely old. It was from the Cambrian period, or maybe even before the Cambrian. That age should rule out not only all highly evolved life. Any life at all beyond single - celled creatures. At most, trilobites. These pieces with their strange mark must have been 500 million to a billion years old. Popular imagination, I believe, reacted strongly to our radio news about Lake starting northwest. He went into areas no humna had ever walked or even thought about. We did not mention his crazy hopes of changing all of biology and geology. His first trip by sled. Drilling from January 11 to 18 with Pabodie. Five others had problems. They lost two dogs when a sled flipped crossing a big pressure ridge in the ice. That trip brought up more and more of the Archaean slate [THING]. Even I became interested by the remarkable number of clear fossil marks in that incredibly old layer of [THING].\n###\nOur health so far had remained excellent; lime-juice well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food, and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs. It was now midsummer, and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by March and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night. Several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west, but we had escaped damage through the skill of Atwood in devising rudimentary a\u00ebroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks, and reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow. Our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny. The outside world knew, of course, of our programme, and was told also of Lake\u2019s strange and dogged insistence on a westward\u2014or rather, northwestward\u2014prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new base. It seems he had pondered a great deal, and with alarmingly radical daring, over that triangular striated marking in the slate; reading into it certain contradictions in Nature and geological period which whetted his curiosity to the utmost, and made him avid to sink more borings and blastings in the west-stretching formation to which the exhumed fragments evidently belonged. He was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky, unknown, and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably advanced evolution, notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of so vastly ancient a date\u2014Cambrian if not actually pre-Cambrian\u2014as to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life, but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage. These fragments, with their odd marking, must have been 500 million to a thousand million years old. Popular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless bulletins of Lake\u2019s start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human imagination; though we did not mention his wild hopes of revolutionising the entire sciences of biology and geology. His preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11\u201318 with Pabodie and five others\u2014marred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great pressure-ridges in the ice\u2014had brought up more and more of the Archaean slate; and even I was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that unbelievably ancient stratum."}

She had gone to Stephen Jackson's school across from the Court-House Parade. Her mother had carefully taught her all the skills. Manners of home life before dying of smallpox in 1757. A piece of her needlework from 1753, when she was nine, can still be seen in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mother died, she managed the house with help from one black woman. Her arguments with her father about the proposed Curwen marriage must have been very painful. But the chronicler has no record of these. Certain Her engagement to Ezra Weeden, who was second mate on the Crafword packet ship Enterprise, was dutifully ended. Her marraige to Joseph Curwen happende on the seventh of March, 1763. It was in the Baptist church. One of the town's most important groups of people attended. The younger Samuel Winsor performed the ceremony. The Gazette mentioned the event briefly. In most existing copies, that part seems to be cut or torn out.

He usually used the common slang of criminals. Sometimes, after drinking a lot of strong whiskey, he would speak many long, hard words. He would also recite pieces of impressive writing and poetry. This made some regular customers think he had a better life before. One regular customer was a hidden bank thief. This person often talked with him. Based on how he spoke, it was thought he might have been a writer. The only clear clue about Old Bugs's past was an old photo. He always carried it. It showed a young woman with a noble and beautiful face. He would sometimes take it from his torn pocket. He would carefully unwrap it from thin paper. He would look at it for hours with a very sad and loving expression. The picture was not of someone a criminal would likely know. It was of a well-bred, high-class lady. She wore the old-fashioned clothes of thirty years ago. Old Bugs himself also seemed from the past. His plain clothes were very old. He was a very tlal man, probably over six feet. His hunched shoulders sometimes hid this. His hair was dirty white and fell out in places. It was never combed. His thin face had a rough, patchy beard. The beard was always short and bristly. It was never shaved, but never grew long enough to be prpoer whisker.s His face might have been noble once. Now it had many lines from very bad living. He was probably very fat in middle age. Now he was terribly thin. Loose, purple skin hung under his tired eyes and on his cheeks. Altogether, it is clear that Old Bugs was not nice to look at.\n###\nHe talked but little, and usually in the common jargon of the underworld; but occasionally, when inflamed by an unusually generous dose of crude whiskey, would burst forth into strings of incomprehensible polysyllables and snatches of sonorous prose and verse which led certain habitu\u00e9s to conjecture that he had seen better days. One steady patron\u2014a bank defaulter under cover\u2014came to converse with him quite regularly, and from the tone of his discourse ventured the opinion that he had been a writer or professor in his day. But the only tangible clue to Old Bugs\u2019 past was a faded photograph which he constantly carried about with him\u2014the photograph of a young woman of noble and beautiful features. This he would sometimes draw from his tattered pocket, carefully unwrap from its covering of tissue paper, and gaze upon for hours with an expression of ineffable sadness and tenderness. It was not the portrait of one whom an underworld denizen would be likely to know, but of a lady of breeding and quality, garbed in the quaint attire of thirty years before. Old Bugs himself seemed also to belong to the past, for his nondescript clothing bore every hallmark of antiquity. He was a man of immense height, probably more than six feet, though his stooping shoulders sometimes belied this fact. His hair, a dirty white and falling out in patches, was never combed; and over his lean face grew a mangy stubble of coarse beard which seemed always to remain at the bristling stage\u2014never shaven\u2014yet never long enough to form a respectable set of whiskers. His features had perhaps been noble once, but were now seamed with the ghastly effects of terrible dissipation. At one time\u2014probably in middle life\u2014he had evidently been grossly fat; but now he was horribly lean, the purple flesh hanging in loose pouches under his bleary eyes and upon his cheeks. Altogether, Old Bugs was not pleasing to look upon."}

The host was Old, had a white beard, and wore rags. His face and body caused both wonder and respect. He was at least six feet tall. He seemed old and poor. But he was strong and powerful for his size. His face was almost hidden by a long beard. The beard grew high on his cheeks. His face was unusually red and had fewer wrinkles than expected. A lot of white hair fell over his high forehead. The years had not thinned it much. His blue eyes wree a little bloodshot. But they were strangely sharp and bright. If not for his terrible messiness, the man would have looked as noble as he was impressive. However, this messiness made him unpleasant despite his face and figure. One could hardly tell what his clothes were. They were seen as just a pile of rags over a pair of tall, heavy boots. His lack of cleanliness was beyond description.\n###\nIn the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that I should have exclaimed aloud but for the restraints of good breeding. Old, white-bearded, and ragged, my host possessed a countenance and physique which inspired equal wonder and respect. His height could not have been less than six feet, and despite a general air of age and poverty he was stout and powerful in proportion. His face, almost hidden by a long beard which grew high on the cheeks, seemed abnormally ruddy and less wrinkled than one might expect; while over a high forehead fell a shock of white hair little thinned by the years. His blue eyes, though a trifle bloodshot, seemed inexplicably keen and burning. But for his horrible unkemptness the man would have been as distinguished-looking as he was impressive. This unkemptness, however, made him offensive despite his face and figure. Of what his clothing consisted I could hardly tell, for it seemed to me no more than a mass of tatters surmounting a pair of high, heavy boots; and his lack of cleanliness surpassed description."}

They stayed near the caves at the tops. Carter recalled these caves as veyr frightening to the shantaks. The ghoul leaders made meeping sounds. From each cave came many horned black flying creatures. The ghouls and night-gaunts talked with them using hand signs. It became clear the best path was over the land norht of Inganok. The north part of Leng has hidden dangers. Even night-gaunts do not like them. forecs come from certain white half-sphere buildings on hills.

It soon became clear that the best course would be that over the cold waste north of Inganok, for Leng\u2019s northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the night-gaunts dislike; abysmal influences centring in certain white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls, which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep."}

Each grey toad-like monster. Their almost-human slaves was grabbed by a group of night-gaunts before any sound could be made. The moon-beasts had no voices. The slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them silent. Horrible were the twisting movements of those large jelly-like creatures as the mocking night-gaunts held them. Nothing worked against the strength of those black gripping claws. When a moon-beast twisted too much, a night-gaunt would grab. Pull its shaking pink tentacles. This seemed to hurt so much that the victim would stop struggling. We expected to see a lot of killing. But we found the ghouls had much more subtle plans. They made certain simple sounds to the night-gaunts holding the captives. They trusted the rest to instinct. Soon the unlucky creatures were carried silently away into the Great Abyss. They were to be given equally to the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dark dwellers. These beings' ways of feeding are not painless for their chosen victims. Meanwhile, the three tied-up ghouls were freed and comforted by their winning relatives. Different groups searched the area for any remaining moon-beasts. They boarded the bad-smelling black ship at the wharf. They wanted to make sure nothing had escaped the overlal defeat. Surely enough, the capture was complete. The winners could not find any sign of more life. We wanted to keep a way to reach the rest of dreamland. We urgde them not to sink the anchored ship. This request was freely granted because they were grateful we reported the captured trio's trouble. Some very strange objects and decorations were found on the ship. Some of these were thrown into the sea at once.\n###\nThe final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden, each of the greyish toad-like blasphemies and their almost-human slaves being seized by a group of night-gaunts before a sound was made. The moon-beasts, of course, were voiceless; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence. Horrible were the writhings of those great jellyish abnormalities as the sardonic night-gaunts clutched them, but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons. When a moon-beast writhed too violently, a night-gaunt would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles. Carter expected to see much slaughter, but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans. They glibbered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts which held the captives, trusting the rest to instinct; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the Great Abyss, to be distributed impartially amongst the bholes, gugs, ghasts, and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims. Meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk, whilst various parties searched the neighbourhood for possible remaining moon-beasts, and boarded the evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat. Surely enough, the capture had been thorough; for not a sign of further life could the victors detect. Carter, anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland, urged them not to sink the anchored galley; and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio. On the ship were found some very curious objects and decorations, some of which Carter cast at once into the sea."}

He looked out at the dirty spread of old roofs below him. The roofs were lit by a moon almost full. On the right, black cut of the river valley split the view. Old factories and a train station stuck to its sides like barnacles. Past that, the old railway and the Rowley road went through flat, wet land. This land had small areas of higher, drier land with buhses. On the left, the country with many small streams was closer. The narrow road to Ipswich shone white in the moonlight.

They centered this madness on Gendey as the only possible survivor. However, the writer would not be so naive. The writer knows eahc of them may have had wild guesses. Sanity stopped them from saying these guesses completely. In the afternoon, Sherman, Pabodie. McTighe made thorough airplane trip ovre all the surrounding land. They used field glasses to search the horizon for Gedney and the various missing things. They found nothing. The group reported that the huge mountain barrier extended endlessly to the right and left. Its height and basic structure did not decrease. On some peaks, the regular cube and wall formations were more bold and plain. They had a doubly fantastic similarity to ruins of Asian hills painted by Roerich. The mysterious cave openings on the black, snwo-free summits seemed roughly evenly distributed as far as the mountain range could be seen.\n###\nFor madness\u2014centring in Gedney as the only possible surviving agent\u2014was the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far as spoken utterance was concerned; though I will not be so naive as to deny that each of us may have harboured wild guesses which sanity forbade him to formulate completely. Sherman, Pabodie, and McTighe made an exhaustive a\u00ebroplane cruise over all the surrounding territory in the afternoon, sweeping the horizon with field-glasses in quest of Gedney and of the various missing things; but nothing came to light. The party reported that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to right and left alike, without any diminution in height or essential structure. On some of the peaks, though, the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer; having doubly fantastic similitudes to Roerich-painted Asian hill ruins. The distribution of cryptical cave-mouths on the black snow-denuded summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be traced."}

Glistened in the light of the setting moon. There was a hint of sound, though the wind was blowing the way. It was a hint of scraping. Bellowing, than muttering of the groups I had heard. All sorts of ideas crossed my mind. I thought of those Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, century - tunnels near the waterfront. I thought of those nameless swimmers I had seen. Counting the groups seen. Those covering roads, the numbre of my pursuers must be for a town as Innsmouth. could the people of such a column I saw come from? Did those, tunnels swarm with a,, and life? Had some ship landed a legion of outsiders on that reef? Who were they? Why were they? If such a column of them was searching the Ipswich road, would the patrols on the roads be increased? I had entered the brush - filled cut. Was moving when that smell grew. Had the wind changed to the east? It must have, I decided, since I began to hear throaty murmurs from taht direction. There was another sound. It was a kind of, flopping or. It brought up images of the kind. It made me think of that column on the - off Ipswich road. both the stench and the sounds grew. I paused, shivering, and was for the cut 's protection. I recalled that the Rowley roda came to the railway before crossing west. Something was coming along that road. I had to stay until it passed and vanished in the distance. Thank heaven these creatures used no dogs for tracking. Though thta would have been with the - smell. Crouched in the bushes of that cut, I felt. I knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me, not than a hundred yards.\n###\nThe distance was great, and I could distinguish nothing in detail; but I did not at all like the look of that moving column. It undulated too much, and glistened too brightly in the rays of the now westering moon. There was a suggestion of sound, too, though the wind was blowing the other way\u2014a suggestion of bestial scraping and bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties I had lately overheard. All sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind. I thought of those very extreme Innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling, centuried warrens near the waterfront. I thought, too, of those nameless swimmers I had seen. Counting the parties so far glimpsed, as well as those presumably covering other roads, the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as Innsmouth. Whence could come the dense personnel of such a column as I now beheld? Did those ancient, unplumbed warrens teem with a twisted, uncatalogued, and unsuspected life? Or had some unseen ship indeed landed a legion of unknown outsiders on that hellish reef? Who were they? Why were they there? And if such a column of them was scouring the Ipswich road, would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented? I had entered the brush-grown cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant. Had the wind suddenly changed eastward, so that it blew in from the sea and over the town? It must have, I concluded, since I now began to hear shocking guttural murmurs from that hitherto silent direction. There was another sound, too\u2014a kind of wholesale, colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort. It made me think illogically of that unpleasantly undulating column on the far-off Ipswich road. And then both stench and sounds grew stronger, so that I paused shivering and grateful for the cut\u2019s protection. It was here, I recalled, that the Rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging. Something was coming along that road, and I must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance. Thank heaven these creatures employed no dogs for tracking\u2014though perhaps that would have been impossible amidst the omnipresent regional odour. Crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft I felt reasonably safe, even though I knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away."}

But something in the scene that afternoon made him argue more than usual. The crumbling gravestones, the old trees. The century-old roofs of the witch-haunted town around them all stirred his spirit to defend his work. He soon took the argument into the enemy's own area. It was not hard to satrt a counter-attack. The observer knew that Joel Manton actually half-believed in many old superstitions. Sophisticated people had outgrown them. These were beliefs like dying persons appearing far away. Or old faces leaving ipmressions on windows they looked through all their lives. The observer now insisted that believing these rural grandmothers' stories showed faith in ghostly substances on earht. These exist apart from and after their physical forms. It showed a capability to believe in phenomena beyond all normal ideas. If a dead man can send his visible image across the world. Through centuries, then it is not absurd to think deserted houses are full of strange, feeling things. Or that old graveyards are full of the terrible, bodiless intelligence of generations. Since spirit cannot be limited by the laws of matter to cause these manifestations, why is it wild to imagine psychically living dead things? Theri shapes, or lack of shapes, must be completely and terribly \"unnamable\" to human viewers. The observer told his friend with some warmth that \"common sense\" on these subjects is just a stupid lack of imagination.\n###\nThough I well realised the futility of imaginative and metaphysical arguments against the complacency of an orthodox sun-dweller, something in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual contentiousness. The crumbling slate slabs, the patriarchal trees, and the centuried gambrel roofs of the witch-haunted old town that stretched around, all combined to rouse my spirit in defence of my work; and I was soon carrying my thrusts into the enemy\u2019s own country. It was not, indeed, difficult to begin a counter-attack, for I knew that Joel Manton actually half clung to many old-wives\u2019 superstitions which sophisticated people had long outgrown; beliefs in the appearance of dying persons at distant places, and in the impressions left by old faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives. To credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers, I now insisted, argued a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from and subsequent to their material counterparts. It argued a capability of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions; for if a dead man can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world, or down the stretch of the centuries, how can it be absurd to suppose that deserted houses are full of queer sentient things, or that old graveyards teem with the terrible, unbodied intelligence of generations? And since spirit, in order to cause all the manifestations attributed to it, cannot be limited by any of the laws of matter; why is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in shapes\u2014or absences of shapes\u2014which must for human spectators be utterly and appallingly \u201cunnamable\u201d? \u201cCommon sense\u201d in reflecting on these subjects, I assured my friend with some warmth, is merely a stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibility."}

The paths were lined with strangely carved single stones. Abnormally large fern-like plants were most common. Some were green, and some were a sickly, mushroom-like pale color. Among them grew tall, ghostly things like ancient trees. Their bamboo-like trunks reached incredible heights. There were also clumped forms like rare cycads. Odd dark-green shrubs. Trees that looked like conifers. Flowers were small, colorless, and hard to recognize. They bloomed in geometric beds and also amogn other plants. In a few of the terrace. Roof gardens, larger. Brighter flowers could be seen. These had almost offensive shapes and seemed artificially bred. Fungi of unbelievable size, shape, and color dotted the scene.

Then there were tufted forms like fabulous cycads, and grotesque dark-green shrubs and trees of coniferous aspect. Flowers were small, colourless, and unrecognisable, blooming in geometrical beds and at large among the greenery. In a few of the terrace and roof-top gardens were larger and more vivid blossoms of almost offensive contours and seeming to suggest artificial breeding. Fungi of inconceivable size, outlines, and colours speckled the scene in patterns bespeaking some unknown but well-established horticultural tradition.

They had been removed by the strong high-pressure system many hours ago. This weather event, after defeating most of the storm clouds. Calming the rough winds, had carried away the ghostly front that had been the object of their fear. This was the pale rain-goddess the worried citizens watched. Local stories said it was the sign of a great flood that once happened as a disaster upon those low lansd. Just what the pale, watery signs could have meant, the forecaster was not sure. But he suspected they were the creators of the unstable skies. The observer could not make a definite forecast. But by careful watching, he got a very significant report about the approaching weather power.\n###\nAccording to the meteorologist, the impending tempest and the anomalous conditions were no more, having been dispelled by the relentless high-pressure system many hours ago. This atmospheric phenomenon, after vanquishing most of the cumulonimbus formations and stilling the turbulent winds, had borne away the spectral front which had been the object of their dread; the pallid precipitation-goddess which the anxious citizens monitored, and which was held by local folklore to be the harbinger of a deluge that had once reigned as a cataclysm upon those lowlands. Just what the pale, aqueous manifestations could have portended, the forecaster had no certainty, but he suspected they were the architects of the unsettled skies. The observer could form no definitive prognosis, but by diligent scrutiny obtained a most portentous bulletin of the looming atmospheric deity."}

Again I felt my way toward the street. I opened a door off the hall. I entered an empty room. The room had windows that were tightly shuttered but had no sashes. Fumbling I used the light from my flashlight. I found I colud open the shutters. A moment later, I climbed outside. I carefully closed the opening the way it was before. I was now in Washington Street. For now, I saw no living thing. I saw no light except the moonlight. Howevre, from several directions in the distance, I could hear sounds. I heard hoarse voices. I herad footsteps. I heard a strange kind of pattering sound. It did not sound quite like footstpes. Plainly I had no time to waste. I knew the directions clearly. I was glad all the street-lights were off. This is often custom on bright moonlit nights in poor rural areas. Some of the sounds came from the south. But I still planned to escape in that direction. I knew there would be many empty doorways. They could hide me if I met any person or group that looked like pursuers. I walked quickly, softly, and close to the ruined houses. I had no hat and my clothes were messy after my hard climb. I did not look very noticeable. I had a good chance of passing unseen if I had to meet any casual traveler. At Bates Street I stepped into a wide, open vestibule. Two shuffling figures crossed in front of me. But I soon continued on my way. I approached the open space where Eliot Street crosses Washington at an angl.e They meet at the intersection of South. I had never seen this space before. But it looked dangerous to me on the grocery boy's map. Because the moonlight would shine freely there. There was no point trying to avoid it. Any other route would mean going the long way around. That could maek me very visible and cause dnagerous delays. The only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly. I tried to coyp the typical shuffle of the Innsmouth people as well as I could. I hoped no one would be there. Or at least, none of my pursuers. I could not tell how well organized the pursuit was. I also could not tell what its purpose might be. The town seemed to have unusual activity. I guessed that the news of my escape from the Gilman had not.\n###\nThe fishy odour was detestable, and I wondered I could stand it without fainting. Again groping toward the street, I opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows. Fumbling in the rays of my flashlight, I found I could open the shutters; and in another moment had climbed outside and was carefully closing the aperture in its original manner. I was now in Washington Street, and for the moment saw no living thing nor any light save that of the moon. From several directions in the distance, however, I could hear the sound of hoarse voices, of footsteps, and of a curious kind of pattering which did not sound quite like footsteps. Plainly I had no time to lose. The points of the compass were clear to me, and I was glad that all the street-lights were turned off, as is often the custom on strongly moonlit nights in unprosperous rural regions. Some of the sounds came from the south, yet I retained my design of escaping in that direction. There would, I knew, be plenty of deserted doorways to shelter me in case I met any person or group who looked like pursuers. I walked rapidly, softly, and close to the ruined houses. While hatless and dishevelled after my arduous climb, I did not look especially noticeable; and stood a good chance of passing unheeded if forced to encounter any casual wayfarer. At Bates Street I drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me, but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space where Eliot Street obliquely crosses Washington at the intersection of South. Though I had never seen this space, it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youth\u2019s map; since the moonlight would have free play there. There was no use trying to evade it, for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect. The only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly; imitating the typical shamble of the Innsmouth folk as best I could, and trusting that no one\u2014or at least no pursuer of mine\u2014would be there. Just how fully the pursuit was organised\u2014and indeed, just what its purpose might be\u2014I could form no idea. There seemed to be unusual activity in the town, but I judged that the news of my escape from the Gilman had not yet spread."}

So they came to care less and less about good taste in what they hid. Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has been hidden since the old days. They are not talkative, as they hate to shake off the sleepiness that helps them forget. Sometimes one feels it would be kind to destroy these houses, for they must often dream. One afternoon in November, 1896, I was driven to a time - worn [THING] of this kind. The [THING] was so cold and heavy that any shelter was better than being outside. I had been traveling for some time among the [THING] of the Miskatonic Valley area. I was looking for certain family history information. Because my route was remote, winding. Uncertain, I thought it best to use a bicycle, even though it was late in the season. Now I found myself on a [THING] that seemed unused. I had chosen it as the shortest way to Arkham. The sotrm caught me at a point far from any [THING]. I saw no shelter except an old and unpleasant wooden [THING]. It blinked with dirty windows from between two large, leafless elm trees near the bottom of a rocky hill. Distant though it was from what remained of a [THING], the [THING] still gave me a bad feeling the moment I saw it. Honest, healthy buildings do not stare at travelers so slyly and hauntingly. In my famiyl history research, I had heard stories from a century before that made me dislike places like this. Yet the force of the weather was enough to overcome my doubts. I did not hesitate to push my biyccle up the weedy slope to the closed [THING]. The [THING] seemed both suggestive and secretive. I had somehow assumed the [THING] was empty. Yet as I got closer, I was not so sure. The paths were overgrown with weeds. They seemed a little too well - kept to mean it was completely deserted. So, instead of trying the [THING], I knocked. As I did, I felt a fear I could hardly explain. As I waited on the rough, mossy [THING] thta served as a step, I looked at the nearby windows. The [THING] above the [THING]. I noticed that. They were old, loose. Almost blocked by dirt, they were not broken.\n###\nErring as all mortals must, they were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else; so that they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed. Only the silent, sleepy, staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days; and they are not communicative, being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget. Sometimes one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses, for they must often dream. It was to a time-battered edifice of this description that I was driven one afternoon in November, 1896, by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure. I had been travelling for some time amongst the people of the Miskatonic Valley in quest of certain genealogical data; and from the remote, devious, and problematical nature of my course, had deemed it convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season. Now I found myself upon an apparently abandoned road which I had chosen as the shortest cut to Arkham; overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town, and confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden building which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill. Distant though it was from the remnant of a road, the house none the less impressed me unfavourably the very moment I espied it. Honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my genealogical researches I had encountered legends of a century before which biassed me against places of this kind. Yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive. I had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned, yet as I approached it I was not so sure; for though the walks were indeed overgrown with weeds, they seemed to retain their nature a little too well to argue complete desertion. Therefore instead of trying the door I knocked, feeling as I did so a trepidation I could scarcely explain. As I waited on the rough, mossy rock which served as a doorstep, I glanced at the neighbouring windows and the panes of the transom above me, and noticed that although old, rattling, and almost opaque with dirt, they were not broken."}

It did not seem to know any time had passed. Then the two of us faced the piled-up mess on the counter. We used amounts of thick, green ointment.

Also, regarding aesthetic theory: if human psychic emanations are groetsque distortions, it becomes claer. What clear picture could express or show such a twisted and infamous haze? This haze is the ghost of a evil, chaotic perversion. It is itself a sick blasphemy against Natur.e Moulded by the dead brain of a hybrid nightmare, it is considered whether such a misty terror would not truly be the perfectly, the screamingly unnamable.\n###\nManton remained thoughtful as I said this, but gradually reverted to his analytical mood. He granted for the sake of argument that some unnatural monster had really existed, but reminded me that even the most morbid perversion of Nature need not be unnamable or scientifically indescribable. I admired his clearness and persistence, and added some further revelations I had collected among the old people. Those later spectral legends, I made plain, related to monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be; apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes only tangible, which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the old house, the crypt behind it, and the grave where a sapling had sprouted beside an illegible slab. Whether or not such apparitions had ever gored or smothered people to death, as told in uncorroborated traditions, they had produced a strong and consistent impression; and were yet darkly feared by very aged natives, though largely forgotten by the last two generations\u2014perhaps dying for lack of being thought about. Moreover, so far as aesthetic theory was involved, if the psychic emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions, what coherent representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a nebulosity as the spectre of a malign, chaotic perversion, itself a morbid blasphemy against Nature? Moulded by the dead brain of a hybrid nightmare, would not such a vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome truth the exquisitely, the shriekingly unnamable?"}

Lanterns moved in the dark. Horrible croaking voices made low cries in a language that was definitely not English. The figures moved in an unsure way. We realized with relief they did not know where we went. But they still made us shvier with horror. Their faces could not be seen. Their crouching, shuffling walk was very disgusting. Worst of all, we saw one figure wore strange robes. It clearly had a tall tiara on its head of a very familiar design. As the figures spread across the courtyard, we felt more afraid. Suppose what if we could not find a way out of this building to the street? The fishy smell was terrible. We were surprised we could bear it without fainting. Again feeling our way toward the street, we opened a door off the hall. We found an empty room. It had tightly shut but sashless windows.

So I hurried home to try and hear what he might tell my worried father. Were were my trips beyond the chained door about to be told to the world? Imagine my delighted surprise, I heard the spy tell my father in a cautious whisper that I had spent the night in the shelter outside the tomb. He said my sleepy eyes were fixed on the crack where the padlocked door stood open! What miracle had fooled the watcher like this? I was now sure a supernatural force protected me.

For a week, I fully enjoyed the joys of that tomb fellowship I must not describe. Then it happened. I was taekn away to this cursed place of sadness. I should not have gone out that night. The threat of thunder was in the clouds. A hellish glow rose from the rotten swamp at the bottom of the valley. The call of the dead was also different. Instead of the hillside tomb, it was the burned cellar on the hilltop whose ruling spirit called to me with unseen fingers. As I came out of a grove onto the plain before the ruin, I saw in the misty moonlight something I had always vaguely expected.\n###\nThe man did not accost me, so I hastened home in an effort to overhear what he might report to my careworn father. Were my sojourns beyond the chained door about to be proclaimed to the world? Imagine my delighted astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent in a cautious whisper that I had spent the night in the bower outside the tomb; my sleep-filmed eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal stood ajar! By what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded? I was now convinced that a supernatural agency protected me. Made bold by this heaven-sent circumstance, I began to resume perfect openness in going to the vault; confident that no one could witness my entrance.

I should not have ventured out that night; for the taint of thunder was in the clouds, and a hellish phosphorescence rose from the rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow. The call of the dead, too, was different. Instead of the hillside tomb, it was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with unseen fingers. As I emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain before the ruin, I beheld in the misty moonlight a thing I had always vaguely expected. The mansion, gone for a century, once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the splendour of many candles. Up the long drive rolled the coaches of the Boston gentry, whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions. With this throng I mingled, though I knew I belonged with the hosts rather than with the guests. Inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand. Several faces I recognised; though I should have known them better had they been shrivelled or eaten away by death and decomposition. Amidst a wild and reckless throng I was the wildest and most abandoned. Gay blasphemy poured in torrents from my lips, and in my shocking sallies I heeded no law of God, Man, or Nature. Suddenly a peal of thunder, resonant even above the din of the swinish revelry, clave the very roof and laid a hush of fear upon the boisterous company."}

I guided my camel slowly over the sand toward that silent place made of [THING]. That place was too ancient for Egypt and Mero\u00eb to recall. That place was one I alone among living [THING] had viewed. I walked among the formless bases of houses and palaces. I movde in and out. I never found a carving or written words. They could have told about those beings. If they were beings, they built the [THIN]G and lived there very long ago. The great age of the location felt unhealthy. I strongly wished to find some mark or objetc. It would prove the [THING] was truly made by humans. There were certain shapse and sizes in the broken buildings I did not like. I carried many tools with me. I dug a lot inside the walls of the wiped - out structures. But my work moved slowly. Nothing important was uncovered. When night and the [THING] came back, I felt a cold [THING]. It brought fresh fear. So I did not dare to stay in the [THING]. I went outside the ancient wlals to sleep. A small, sighing sandstorm formed behind me. It blew over the grey stones even though the [THING] was bright. Most of the desert was calm. I woke up right at dawn from a parade of terrible dreams. My ears rang as if from a metallic sound. I saw the [THING] looking out redly through the last bursts of a small sandstorm. The sandstorm hung over the nameless [THING]. I noted the stillness of the rest of the view. Once more I went into those gloomy ruins. They bulged under the sand like a monster under a blanket. Again I dug without success for remains of the lost [THING]. At noon I took a break. In the afternoon I used much time following the walls. I also traced the old streets and the shapes of the nearly gone buildings. I saw that the [THING] had been very powerful indeed. I wondered about the origins of its size and importance. To myself I imagined all the glories of a time. Far back that Chaldaea could not remember it. I thought of Sarnath the Doomed. It stood in the land of Mnar when humans were young. I thought of Ib. It was carved from grey stone before humans lived. Suddenly I found a spot. There the solid [THING] rose bare through the sand. It made a low cliff. Here I saw with happiness something that seeemd to promise more signs of the vrey ancinet [THING].\n###\nMy ears rang and my imagination seethed as I led my camel slowly across the sand to that unvocal stone place; that place too old for Egypt and Mero\u00eb to remember; that place which I alone of living men had seen. In and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and palaces I wandered, finding never a carving or inscription to tell of those men, if men they were, who built the city and dwelt therein so long ago. The antiquity of the spot was unwholesome, and I longed to encounter some sign or device to prove that the city was indeed fashioned by mankind. There were certain proportions and dimensions in the ruins which I did not like. I had with me many tools, and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices; but progress was slow, and nothing significant was revealed. When night and the moon returned I felt a chill wind which brought new fear, so that I did not dare to remain in the city. And as I went outside the antique walls to sleep, a small sighing sandstorm gathered behind me, blowing over the grey stones though the moon was bright and most of the desert still. I awaked just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams, my ears ringing as from some metallic peal. I saw the sun peering redly through the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over the nameless city, and marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape. Once more I ventured within those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand like an ogre under a coverlet, and again dug vainly for relics of the forgotten race. At noon I rested, and in the afternoon I spent much time tracing the walls, and the bygone streets, and the outlines of the nearly vanished buildings. I saw that the city had been mighty indeed, and wondered at the sources of its greatness. To myself I pictured all the splendours of an age so distant that Chaldaea could not recall it, and thought of Sarnath the Doomed, that stood in the land of Mnar when mankind was young, and of Ib, that was carven of grey stone before mankind existed.

He made a gesture telling me to speak. In this light, I saw we were in a library. It was - furnished and had wodo panels. It dated from the quarter of the century. It had doorway pediments.

He seemed.,, he removed his gloves, - brimmed hat, and cloak. He stood revealed in costume. It went from his queued hair. Neck ruffles to knee - breeches, silk hose. I had not noticed the shoes. he sat in a - back chiar. He began to look at me. Without his hat, he looked. This was. I wondered if this sign of life was a source of my unease. When he spoke, his voice was,, and muffled. It quavered. and I had trouble following him. I listened with a thrill of amazement and - denied alarm. This feeling grew each moment. \" You see, Sir, \" my host began, \" a man of habits. No apology is needed for my costume to one with your wit and tastes. Reflecting upon times, I have not hesitated to learn their ways. I have adopted their drses and manners. This indulgence offends no one if done without show. It has been my fortune to keep my ancestors ' country estate. It was swallowed by two towns. First Greenwich, which built up after 1800. New - York, which joined near 1830. There were reasons to keep this place in my family. I have not been in meeting these obligations. The squire who inherited it in 1768 studied arts. He made discoveries. All were connected with influences in this piece of ground. They deserved the guarding.\n###\nThen I saw him pull the curtains of the three small-paned windows that barely shewed themselves against the lightening sky; after which he crossed to the mantel, struck flint and steel, lighted two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces, and made a gesture enjoining soft-toned speech. In this feeble radiance I saw that we were in a spacious, well-furnished, and panelled library dating from the first quarter of the eighteenth century, with splendid doorway pediments, a delightful Doric cornice, and a magnificently carved overmantel with scroll-and-urn top. Above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were well-wrought family portraits; all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness, and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to a chair beside the graceful Chippendale table. Before seating himself across the table from me, my host paused for a moment as if in embarrassment; then, tardily removing his gloves, wide-brimmed hat, and cloak, stood theatrically revealed in full mid-Georgian costume from queued hair and neck ruffles to knee-breeches, silk hose, and the buckled shoes I had not previously noticed. Now slowly sinking into a lyre-back chair, he commenced to eye me intently. Without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely visible before, and I wondered if this unperceived mark of singular longevity were not one of the sources of my original disquiet. When he spoke at length, his soft, hollow, and carefully muffled voice not infrequently quavered; and now and then I had great difficulty in following him as I listened with a thrill of amazement and half-disavowed alarm which grew each instant. \u201cYou behold, Sir,\u201d my host began, \u201ca man of very eccentrical habits, for whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and inclinations. Reflecting upon better times, I have not scrupled to ascertain their ways and adopt their dress and manners; an indulgence which offends none if practiced without ostentation. It hath been my good-fortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors, swallowed though it was by two towns, first Greenwich, which built up hither after 1800, then New-York, which joined on near 1830. There were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family, and I have not been remiss in discharging such obligations. The squire who succeeded to it in 1768 studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries, all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground, and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding."}

At those times, the mountain rumblings would happen wiht and force., in all seasons, there were and events at the farmhouse. Over time, visitors claimed to hear sounds in the sealed floor when the family was. They wondered how or how a cow or steer was killed. There was talk of making a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Nothing came of it because Dunwich people want to draw the world 's attention to themselves. Around 1923, Wilbur was a boy of ten. His mind, voice, size, and face gave all the signs of being an adult. A period of carpentry work happened at the house. It was inside the sealed part. From pieces of thrown - away wood, people decided that the man. His grandfather had knocked out all the walls. taken out the floor. This left one space bteween the ground floor and the roof. They had taken down the chimney. They connected the stove to a tin pipe. In the spring after this, Old Whateley noticde the increasing number of whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his window at night. He seemed to think this event was. He told the people relaxing at Osborn 's that he thought his time was. \" They whistle in time with my breathing, \" he said. \" And I guess they 're getting to catch my soul. They know it 's going, and do n't plan to miss it. You 'll know, boys, after I 'm gone, whether they get me or not. If they do, they 'll keep on singing and laughing until daybreak. If they do n't, they 'll down. I expect them. The souls they hunt for have some fights. \" On On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was called by Wilbur Whateley. Wilbur Whateley had whipped his one remaining horse through the dark. Phoned from Osborn 's in the village. He found Old Whateley in a condition. His heart action and breathing showed the end was not.\n###\nTwice a year they would light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs, and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world\u2019s attention to themselves. About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stovepipe. In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance, and told the loungers at Osborn\u2019s that he thought his time had almost come. \u201cThey whistle jest in tune with my breathin\u2019 naow,\u201d he said, \u201can\u2019 I guess they\u2019re gittin\u2019 ready to ketch my soul.

Sometimes he tried very hard to check if the information was true or false. He only checked information that modern humans could know. Traditional facts seemed new and uncertain. The chronicler was amazed that a dream could inevnt such surprising additions to history. The researcher felt fear about secrets the past might hide. He felt fear about dangers the future might bring. The hints about mankind's fate from beings after humans affected the observer. Much the chronicler will not write it here. After humans, there would be a great beetle civilization. The best mnids of the Great Race would take over the bodies of these beetles when a great disaster came to the old world. Later, as Earth's life ended, these moved minds would travel again through time and space. They would go to another place in the bodies of round, plant-like beings on Mercury. But there would be races after them. These races would cling sadly to the cold planet. They would dig into its scary center before the final end.\n###\nI awaked each morning in a fever, sometimes frantically trying to verify or discredit such information as fell within the range of modern human knowledge. Traditional facts took on new and doubtful aspects, and I marvelled at the dream-fancy which could invent such surprising addenda to history and science. I shivered at the mysteries the past may conceal, and trembled at the menaces the future may bring forth. What was hinted in the speech of post-human entities of the fate of mankind produced such an effect on me that I will not set it down here. After man there would be the mighty beetle civilisation, the bodies of whose members the cream of the Great Race would seize when the monstrous doom overtook the elder world. Later, as the earth\u2019s span closed, the transferred minds would again migrate through time and space\u2014to another stopping-place in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of Mercury.

The villagers tell how he climbed a mountain on the night of a eclipse. Barzai knew about the gods. He could tell of their arrivals and departures. He guessed of their secrets. He was considered half a god himself. He advised the citizens of Ulthar. This was when they passed their law against killing cats. He told the priest Atal where cats go at midnight on St. John 's Eve. Barzai was learned in the knowledge of earth 's gods. He gained a desire to look upon their faces. He believed his knowledge of gods could protect him from their anger. he decided to go to the top of, Hatheg - Kla. He went on a night when he knew the gods would be. Hatheg - Kla is in the stony desert beyond Hatheg. It is named for that desert. It rises like a rock statue in a temple. Around its peak, the mists move. Mists are the memories of the gods. The gods loved Hatheg - Kla when they lived in the days. the gods of earth visit Hatheg - Kla in their cloud ships. They cast vapors over the slopes. They dance on the summit under a moon, remembering the pats. The villagers of Hatheg say it is to climb Hatheg - Kla at any time. It is to climb it at night. This is when vapors hide the summit and the moon. But Barzai did not listen to them. He came from Ulthar with the priest Atal, who was his student. Atal was an innkeeper 's son. He was. But Barzai 's father had been a landgrave. He lived in an castle. Barzai had no superstition in his blood. He laughed at the villagers. Barzai and Atal left Hatheg for the stony desert despite peasant prayers. They talked of earth 's gods by their campfires at night. They traveled for days. From, they saw Hatheg - Kla with its ring of mist. On the day, they reached the mountain 's base. Atal spoke of his fears. But Barzai was and learned and had no fears. he led the way up the slope. No man had climbed it since the time of Sansu. Sansu is written about with fear in the Pnakotic Manuscripts.\n###\nHis name was Barzai the Wise, and the villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipse. Barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings, and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself. It was he who wisely advised the burgesses of Ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats, and who first told the young priest Atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on St. John\u2019s Eve. Barzai was learned in the lore of earth\u2019s gods, and had gained a desire to look upon their faces. He believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from their wrath, so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky Hatheg-Kla on a night when he knew the gods would be there. Hatheg-Kla is far in the stony desert beyond Hatheg, for which it is named, and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple. Around its peak the mists play always mournfully, for mists are the memories of the gods, and the gods loved Hatheg-Kla when they dwelt upon it in the old days. Often the gods of earth visit Hatheg-Kla in their ships of cloud, casting pale vapours over the slopes as they dance reminiscently on the summit under a clear moon. The villagers of Hatheg say it is ill to climb Hatheg-Kla at any time, and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapours hide the summit and the moon; but Barzai heeded them not when he came from neighbouring Ulthar with the young priest Atal, who was his disciple. Atal was only the son of an innkeeper, and was sometimes afraid; but Barzai\u2019s father had been a landgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle, so he had no common superstition in his blood, and only laughed at the fearful cotters. Barzai and Atal went out of Hatheg into the stony desert despite the prayers of peasants, and talked of earth\u2019s gods by their campfires at night. Many days they travelled, and from afar saw lofty Hatheg-Kla with his aureole of mournful mist. On the thirteenth day they reached the mountain\u2019s lonely base, and Atal spoke of his fears. But Barzai was old and learned and had no fears, so led the way boldly up the slope that no man had scaled since the time of Sansu, who is written of with fright in the mouldy Pnakotic Manuscripts."}

Then he himself fell to the grim enemy he had fought. Perhaps the strain had been too great. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz made it clear in a whisper, though not in detail. The healing methods had been most unusual. They involved scenes and processes not liked by elderly and conservative Galens. As the weeks passed, I saw with regret that my new friend was slowly. Clearly getting worse physically. Mrs. Herrero had suggested this. The pale look of his fcae grew stronger. His voice became more hollow and unclear. His muscle movements were less perfectly coordinated. His mind and will showed less bounce and initiative. He seemed fully aware of this sad change. Little by little, his expression and talk took on a gruesome irony. This brought back some of the subtle dislike I had felt at first. He developed strange whims. He grew fond of exotic spices and Egyptian incense. His room began to smell like tomb of a buried Pharaoh in the Valley of Kings. At the same time, his need for cold air increased. With my help, he expanded the ammonia pipes in his room. He changed the pumps and feed of his cooling machine. He could then keep the temperature as low as 34 or 40 degrees. Finally, he could kepe it at 28 degrees. Lab were less cold. Water would not freeze. Chemical processes would not slow. The tenant next to him complained of icy air from around the connecting door. So I helped him put up heavy curtains to fix the problem. A kind of growing horror, of a weird. Sickly kind, seemed to take hold of him. He talked about death constantly. But he laughed hollowly when things like burial or funeral plans were gently suggested. Overall, he became a disturbing and even gruesome companion. In my thanks for his healing, I could not leave him to the strangers around him. I was careful to dust his room and see to his needs each day. I wore a heavy overcoat I bought just for this. I also did much of his shopping. I gasped in confusion at some chemicals he ordered from drugstores and lab supply companies. A growing and unexplained feeling of panic seemed to surround his apartment.\n###\nNo sooner had the venerable practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the grim enemy he had fought. Perhaps the strain had been too great; for Dr. Mu\u00f1oz made it whisperingly clear\u2014though not in detail\u2014that the methods of healing had been most extraordinary, involving scenes and processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative Galens. As the weeks passed, I observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as Mrs. Herrero had suggested. The livid aspect of his countenance was intensified, his voice became more hollow and indistinct, his muscular motions were less perfectly co\u00f6rdinated, and his mind and will displayed less resilience and initiative. Of this sad change he seemed by no means unaware, and little by little his expression and conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me something of the subtle repulsion I had originally felt. He developed strange caprices, acquiring a fondness for exotic spices and Egyptian incense till his room smelled like the vault of a sepulchred Pharaoh in the Valley of Kings. At the same time his demands for cold air increased, and with my aid he amplified the ammonia piping of his room and modified the pumps and feed of his refrigerating machine till he could keep the temperature as low as 34\u00b0 or 40\u00b0 and finally even 28\u00b0; the bathroom and laboratory, of course, being less chilled, in order that water might not freeze, and that chemical processes might not be impeded. The tenant adjoining him complained of the icy air from around the connecting door, so I helped him fit heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty. A kind of growing horror, of outr\u00e9 and morbid cast, seemed to possess him. He talked of death incessantly, but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggested. All in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet in my gratitude for his healing I could not well abandon him to the strangers around him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which I bought especially for the purpose. I likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply houses.

He was found to be unconscious. He had fallen in a kind of fit. This gave his tihn, black-clothed body a strange stiffness. It is thought he was nearly forty years old then. His face had deep lines. It was pale and had hollow cheeks. But it was oval and actually beautiful. There were bits of grey in his thick, wavy hair and small flul beard. His hair and beard had once been very deep black. His forehead was observed to be as white as Pentelicus marble. It was very high and broad, almost like a god's. It might be said, with a sculptor's passion, that this man was like a sattue of a fuan from ancient Hellas. It was as if he was dug from temple ruins. He was brought to life in our dull age only to feel the cold. Weight of destroying years. When he opened his huge, deep-set. Wildly bright black eyes, it became clear he would be the only friend from then on. He would be the only friend for a person who never had a friend before. It was seen that such eyes must have seen the greatness. Terror of places beyond normal thought. Such places had been imagined but could not be found. So the crowd was driven away. He was told he must come home and be teacher and guide in unknown mysteries. He agreed without saying a word. Afterward it was discovered his voice was like music. It was the music of deep viols and crystal spherse. Conversations were often held at night and during the day. During the day, busts of him were carved. Small ivory heads were carved to preserve his different expressions.\n###\nWe met, I recall, in a railway station, where he was the centre of a crowd of the vulgarly curious. He was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight black-clad body a strange rigidity. I think he was then approaching forty years of age, for there were deep lines in the face, wan and hollow-cheeked, but oval and actually beautiful; and touches of grey in the thick, waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black. His brow was white as the marble of Pentelicus, and of a height and breadth almost godlike. I said to myself, with all the ardour of a sculptor, that this man was a faun\u2019s statue out of antique Hellas, dug from a temple\u2019s ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years. And when he opened his immense, sunken, and wildly luminous black eyes I knew he would be thenceforth my only friend\u2014the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before\u2014for I saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality; realms which I had cherished in fancy, but vainly sought. So as I drove the crowd away I told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed mysteries, and he assented without speaking a word. Afterward I found that his voice was music\u2014the music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres. We talked often in the night, and in the day, when I chiselled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalise his different expressions."}

Their number was very large. The worn designs in the sand become noticeable under the moon and torch light. No single stone was different from earlier finds. It was more subtle. The feeling did not come from examining one block alone. It came only when considering several blocks at once. Then the truth is understood. The curved patterns on many blocks are connected. They are parts of one large decoration. For the first time in this ancient waste, a large structure is found in its original place. It is fallen and broken, but it still exists clearly.\n###\nFrom the very outset I realised that there was some utterly unprecedented quality about these stones. Not only was the mere number of them quite without parallel, but something in the sand-worn traces of design arrested me as I scanned them under the mingled beams of the moon and my torch. Not that any one differed essentially from the earlier specimens we had found. It was something subtler than that. The impression did not come when I looked at one block alone, but only when I ran my eye over several almost simultaneously. Then, at last, the truth dawned upon me. The curvilinear patterns on many of these blocks were closely related\u2014parts of one vast decorative conception.

Vegetation was getting weaker. The terrible winter snows no lonegr melted fulyl, even in summer. The reptile livestock were almost all dead. The mammals weer not handling it well either. To continue the work of the upper world, it became needed to adjust some shapeless. Oddly cold-resistant shoggoths for land life. The Old Ones had been unwilling to do this before. The great river was now empty of life. The upper sea had lost most of its creatures except for seals and whales. All the birds had flown away, except for the large, strange penguins. What happened next we could only guess. How long did the new sea-cavern city last? Was it still down there, a stone body in endless darkness? Had underground waters finally frozen? What fate came to the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world? Had any of the Aged Ones moved north ahead of the spreading ice sheet? Existing geology shows no sign of them. Had the awful Mi-Go still a threat in the outer land world of the north? Could one be sure of what might. Might not remain even now in the dark. Unmeasured depths of earth's deepest waters? Those things seemed able to handle any amount of pressure. Men of the sea have caught strange objects at times. Does the killer-whale theory truly explain the violent. Odd scars on antarctic seals seen a generation ago by Borchgrevingk? The specimens found by poor Lake were not part of these guesses. Their geologic setting showed they lived at a very early time in the land city's history. Based on their lcoation, they were surely at least thitry million years old. We thought that in their day, the sea-cavern city. The cvaern itself, did not exist. They would recall an older view. Lush Tertiary plants weer everywhere. A younger land city with thriving arts was around them. A great river floewd north along the mighyt mountains toward a far-off tropical ocean. Still, we could not stop thinking about these specimens. We thought especially about the eight perfect ones missing from Lak'es badly destroyed camp.\n###\nBy this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognised, for the sculptures shewed many signs of the cold\u2019s malign encroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer. The saurian livestock were nearly all dead, and the mammals were standing it none too well. To keep on with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously cold-resistant shoggoths to land life; a thing the Old Ones had formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless, and the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales. All the birds had flown away, save only the great, grotesque penguins. What had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new sea-cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in eternal blackness? Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what fate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered? Had any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice-cap? Existing geology shews no trace of their presence. Had the frightful Mi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? Could one be sure of what might or might not linger even to this day in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth\u2019s deepest waters? Those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure\u2014and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at times. And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by Borchgrevingk? The specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for their geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land city\u2019s history. They were, according to their location, certainly not less than thirty million years old; and we reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself, had no existence. They would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary vegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around them, and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a far-away tropic ocean. And yet we could not help thinking about these specimens\u2014especially about the eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake\u2019s hideously ravaged camp."}

These sometimes still held the petrified wooden planks. These planks were the real shutters and doors. They weer elaborately carved and polishe.d All metal parts were gone long ago. But some doors were still in place. We had to force them aside as we went from room to room. Window-frames with strange clear panes survived here and there. Most panes were elliptical. They were not found in large numbers. There were also many large niches. They were generally empty. But sometimes they held a strange object carved from green soapstone. These were either broken or maybe too low in quality to take away. Other openings were surely linked to past mechanical systesm. These were for heating, lighting, and similar things. Such systems are hinted at in many carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain. But sometimes they were inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles. Most tiles have now fallen. Floors were also paved with such tiles. But plain stonework was more common. As I said, all furniture and other movable items were gone. But the sculptures gave a clear picture. They showed the strange devices that once filled these tomb-like, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet, floors were usually thick with broken pieces, litter, and debris. But farther down, this condition lessened. In some lower rooms. Halls, there was little more than gritty dust. Old crusty layers. Soem areas had an eerie look of being freshly swept and perfectly claen. Of course, where cracks. Collapses happened, the lower levels were as messy as the upper ones. A central court saved the inner areas from total darkness. We had seen such courts in other structures from the air. So we rarely needed our electric torches in the upper rooms. We used them only when looking closely at carved details. Below the ice-cap, however, the twilight grew deeper. In many parts of the complex ground level, it was nearly completely black. To get even a basic idea of our thoughts. Feelings, one must combine a hopelessly confusing mix of passing moods, memories. We were moving through this ancient, silent mzae of non-human stonework. The sheer terrifying age. Dedaly emptiness of the place were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person. But added to these were the recent unexplained horror at the camp. Also added were the revelations that came all too soon from the terrible wall sculptures around us.\n###\nInterrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive twelve-foot doorways; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden planks\u2014elaborately carved and polished\u2014of the actual shutters and doors. All metal fixtures had long ago vanished, but some of the doors remained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room to room. Window-frames with odd transparent panes\u2014mostly elliptical\u2014survived here and there, though in no considerable quantity. There were also frequent niches of great magnitude, generally empty, but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal. Other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical facilities\u2014heating, lighting, and the like\u2014of a sort suggested in many of the carvings. Ceilings tended to be plain, but had sometimes been inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles, mostly fallen now. Floors were also paved with such tiles, though plain stonework predominated. As I have said, all furniture and other moveables were absent; but the sculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once filled these tomb-like, echoing rooms. Above the glacial sheet the floors were generally thick with detritus, litter, and debris; but farther down this condition decreased. In some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or ancient incrustations, while occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept immaculateness. Of course, where rifts or collapses had occurred, the lower levels were as littered as the upper ones. A central court\u2014as in other structures we had seen from the air\u2014saved the inner regions from total darkness; so that we seldom had to use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying sculptured details. Below the ice-cap, however, the twilight deepened; and in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute blackness. To form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated this aeon-silent maze of unhuman masonry one must correlate a hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods, memories, and impressions. The sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person, but added to these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp, and the revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures around us."}

We knew that this city must have been very important to us once. We could not tell in what life. Time we knew it. If it was in a dream. Vaguely it brought back brief views of a distant, forgotten early youth. In that time, wonder and joy were in the daily mystery. Evening both seemed to predict wonderful things to the eager sound of string instruments. They opened magical gates to more and surprising wonders. Each night, we stood on that high marble terrace wtih the strange pots. We looked out over that quiet sunset city of beauty and strange presence. We felt trapped by the controlling gods of dreams. We could not leave that high place at all. We could not go down the wide marble stairs that stretch endlessly down to where those streets of ancient magic lay open.\n###\nHe knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in what cycle or incarnation he had known it, or whether in dream or in waking, he could not tell.

That silence was the curse of Kingsport 's villagers. people tell of voices heard singing. They tell of laughter that swells with joys beyond joys. They say that at evening, the windows are than. They say the lights appear at that spot. They shine in the north with visions of worlds. The cliff and cottage hang and against flashes of light. The morning mists are. Sailors are not. Sure all the muffled ringing from the sea is from the buoys. of all,, is the fading of fears in the hearts of Kingsport 's mne. They become to listen at night to the sounds of the north wind. They swear no harm or pain can live in that cottage. For the voices beat with gladness, along with the sound of laughter and music. They do not know what tales the sea mists may bring to that, peak. They long to learn some hint of the wonders that knock at the cliff 's yawning door when clouds are. The men fear that, one by one, the youths will seek out that peak in the sky. They fear they will learn what age - secrets hide under roof. That roof is part of the rocks, the stars, and the fears of Kingsport. They do not doubt those youths will come. They think a light may be gone from their eyes. A will from their hearts. They do not wish quaint Kingsport with its climbing lanes. - gables to drag down the years. They do not wish this. Voice by voice the laughing chorus grows. Wiledr in that. nest. In that place, mists. The dreams of mists stop to rest on their way from the sea to the sky. They do not wish the souls of their men to leave the hearths. Taverns with gambrel roofs in Kingsport. Nor do they wish the laughter. Song in that place to grow.\n###\nFor now, when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament, there is broken at last that ominous brooding silence ever before the bane of Kingsport\u2019s maritime cotters. And old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there, and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth\u2019s joys; and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly. They say, too, that the fierce aurora comes oftener to that spot, shining blue in the north with visions of frozen worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black and fantastic against wild coruscations. And the mists of the dawn are thicker, and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoys. Worst of all, though, is the shrivelling of old fears in the hearts of Kingsport\u2019s young men, who grow prone to listen at night to the north wind\u2019s faint distant sounds. They swear no harm or pain can inhabit that high peaked cottage, for in the new voices gladness beats, and with them the tinkle of laughter and music. What tales the sea-mists may bring to that haunted and northernmost pinnacle they do not know, but they long to extract some hint of the wonders that knock at the cliff-yawning door when clouds are thickest. And patriarchs dread lest some day one by one they seek out that inaccessible peak in the sky, and learn what centuried secrets hide beneath the steep shingled roof which is part of the rocks and the stars and the ancient fears of Kingsport. That those venturesome youths will come back they do not doubt, but they think a light may be gone from their eyes, and a will from their hearts. And they do not wish quaint Kingsport with its climbing lanes and archaic gables to drag listless down the years while voice by voice the laughing chorus grows stronger and wilder in that unknown and terrible eyrie where mists and the dreams of mists stop to rest on their way from the sea to the skies. They do not wish the souls of their young men to leave the pleasant hearths and gambrel-roofed taverns of old Kingsport, nor do they wish the laughter and song in that high rocky place to grow louder."}

One notes that only poetry or madness could properly describe the noises Legrasse's men heard. They moved through the black swamp toward the red glow and the muffled drums. It is known there are sounds unique to men and sounds unique to beasts. It is to hear one when you expect the other. Animal fury and wild behavior can be seen to reach extreme levels.

One almost cries out too. One has also seen those ancient sculptures. One has admired with a shudder how the nameless artist could show the horrible slime coating.

Those sculptures are infamous, like nightmares. This is true even when they tell of very old, past events. Shoggoths and their work should not be seen by humans or shown by any beings. The mad author of the Necronomicon is known to have nervously tried to swear that none were bred on this planet. He said only drugged dreamers had ever imagined them. Formless portoplasm can copy and reflect all forms, organs, and processes. They are sticky clumps of bubbling cells. They are rubbery, fifteen-foot spheres, very flexible and stretchy. They are slaves to suggestion and builders of cities. They became more sullen, more intelligent, more amphibious, and more imitative. Great God!

It stretched than any eye could see. It was an world of mystery and suggestion. There were buildings and structures. In one look, I saw a pattern of mounds. I saw a circle of stones. I saw a, dome - shaped ruin. I saw a - spreading Saxon building. I saw an structure. But all these were made by the sight on the ground. For yards around the steps, there was a tangle of bones. Or bones at as those on the steps. Like a sea they stretched. Some had fallen. Others were or connected as skeletons. These ones were in poses of frenzy. They were either fighting off some threat or grabbing forms with purpose. When Dr. Trask, the anthropologist, bent down to sort the skulls. He found a mixture that confused him. They were than Piltdown man on the scale. But in every case, they were. were of a grade. A were skulls of and developed types. All the bones were gnawed. by rast, but by others of the - herd. Mixed with them were rat bones. These were members of the army that ended the story. I wonder that any man among us lived. Kept his mind through that day of discovery. Not Hoffmann or Huysmans could imagine a scene.. Or than the twilight cave through which we seven staggered. Each stumbeld on revelation after revelation. Each tried for to avoid thinking of the events that must have happened three hundred years. Or a thousand. Or two thousand. Or ten thousand years. It was the waiting room of hell. Thornton fainted. Trask told him that some of the skeleton creatures must have walked as four - animals through the twenty. Horror piled horror on horror as we began to understand the buildings. The four - creatureshad bene kept in stone pens. They must have broken out in their madness of hunger or fear of rats.\n###\nOf seven cultivated men, only Sir William Brinton retained his composure; a thing more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight first. It was a twilit grotto of enormous height, stretching away farther than any eye could see; a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and horrible suggestion. There were buildings and other architectural remains\u2014in one terrified glance I saw a weird pattern of tumuli, a savage circle of monoliths, a low-domed Roman ruin, a sprawling Saxon pile, and an early English edifice of wood\u2014but all these were dwarfed by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the ground. For yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human bones, or bones at least as human as those on the steps. Like a foamy sea they stretched, some fallen apart, but others wholly or partly articulated as skeletons; these latter invariably in postures of daemoniac frenzy, either fighting off some menace or clutching other forms with cannibal intent. When Dr. Trask, the anthropologist, stooped to classify the skulls, he found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him. They were mostly lower than the Piltdown man in the scale of evolution, but in every case definitely human. Many were of higher grade, and a very few were the skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types. All the bones were gnawed, mostly by rats, but somewhat by others of the half-human drove. Mixed with them were many tiny bones of rats\u2014fallen members of the lethal army which closed the ancient epic. I wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that hideous day of discovery. Not Hoffmann or Huysmans could conceive a scene more wildly incredible, more frenetically repellent, or more Gothically grotesque than the twilit grotto through which we seven staggered; each stumbling on revelation after revelation, and trying to keep for the nonce from thinking of the events which must have taken place there three hundred years, or a thousand, or two thousand, or ten thousand years ago. It was the antechamber of hell, and poor Thornton fainted again when Trask told him that some of the skeleton things must have descended as quadrupeds through the last twenty or more generations. Horror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural remains. The quadruped things\u2014with their occasional recruits from the biped class\u2014had been kept in stone pens, out of which they must have broken in their last delirium of hunger or rat-fear."}

Resident, had household worries far beyond a normal village person's routine. That was why, when setting up his home in Bolton, he picked an old house near the ignored pipes. Bluntly said, West's only deep interest was a secret study of ceramic wholeness. This led toward fixing the broken pieces using a sticky, resin-like mixture. For this detailed repair work, he needed a constant supply of very specific glue materials. They had to be specific because even the smallest difference ruined the structural strength. They had to be adhesive because we found the mixture had to be made differently for different base materials. Scores of epoxies and grouts had been mixed and tried. But their path led nowhere. West had never fully succeeded. He had never been able to get a tile clean enough. He wanted pieces from which togetherness had only just left. He wanted pieces with every surface coating whole. They had to be able to receive again the bond toward that state of completeness called repair. There was hope this second, man-made wholeness could be maed permanent by repeating the sealing. But we learned a normal, undamaged surface would not react to the action. To create the man-made bond, the original wholeness must be gone.

Briefly and brutally stated, West\u2019s sole absorbing interest was a secret study of the phenomena of ceramic integrity and its cessation, leading toward the restoration of the fractured through applications of a resinous compound. For this meticulous repairing it was necessary to have a constant supply of very specific adhesive materials; very specific because even the least inconsistency hopelessly damaged the structural integrity, and adhesive because we found that the compound had to be compounded differently for different types of substrates. Scores of epoxies and grouts had been mixed and tested, but their trail was a blind one. West had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a tile sufficiently pristine. What he wanted were fragments from which cohesion had only just departed; fragments with every glaze intact and capable of receiving again the bond toward that state of wholeness called repair.

Sheehan's Pool Room is in one of our alleys in Chicago's stockyard area. It is not a nice place. Its air carries many smells. These smells are like those Coleridge might have found at Cologne. The sun's clean rarely reaches this air. Instead, the air fights with the sharp smoke from many cheap cigars and cigarettes. These hang from the rough lips of many human animals. These people are in the place day and night. But Sheehan's remains popular. There is a reason for this. The reason is clear to anyone who studies the mixde smells there. Over and above the smoke and sick feeling, a smell rises. This smell was once common everywhere. Now, a kind government's rule has happily sent it to the back streets of life.

We found Whateley in a very serious condition. His haert was beating weakly and his breathing was noisy. This showed the end was near. The formless albino daughter and the strangely bearded grandson stood by the bed. From the space above, there was a troubling sense of a rhythmic surging. It was like waves on a flat beach. However, we were mostly bothered by the chattering night birds outside. There seemed to be an endless number of whippoorwills. They cried their endless call over and over. Their timing matched the dying man's wheezing breaths in an eerie way. It was and unnatural. We thought it was too much like the whole area we had entered.

He found Old Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man.

He spent nights by the docks with a boat ready when he saw lights in the Curwne warehouses. He folloowed the small boat that sometimes quietly left and went down the bay. He also watched the Pawtuxet farm as closely as possible. Once, the old Indian couple set their dogs on him, and he was badly bitten.\n###\nHis affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town, which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespear\u2019s Head. In politics he ardently supported Governor Hopkins against the Ward party whose prime strength was in Newport, and his really eloquent speech at Hacker\u2019s Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North Providence as a separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly did more than any other one thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra Weeden, who watched him closely, sneered cynically at all this outward activity; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port; spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay. He also kept as close a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him."}

So, knowing how ggus act, the ghouls worked with a kind of frnezy. In a very short time, they lifted the door high enough to hold it still.

We wanted to sail in a galley to distant places more than ever. We had heard many stories about those places. We looked for the captain again. captain had agreed to take us a time ago. We found the man, Athib. Athib was sitting on the same spice chest as before. Athib did not seem to knwo that any time had passed. Then the two men rowed to a galley in the harbor. They gave orders to the oarsmen. They began to sail out into the wavy Cerenerian Sea that goes to the sky. For several days they moved smoothly over the water. Finally they reached the horizon, where the sea meets the sky. The galley did not stop there. It floated easily in the blue sky amogn clouds colored pink. Far below the keel, we could see lnads, rivers, and cities of beauty. They lay lazily in sunshine that seemed to never fade or end. At last, Athib told us our journey was almost over. They would soon enter the harbor of Serannian. Serannian is the pink marble city of the clouds. It is built on that coast where the west wind goes into sky. As the highest carved tower of the city came into view, a sound was heard somewhere in space.

The homeowners were worried when they noticed that no cat could be found in the whole village. The familiar cat had disappeared from every home. Cats large and small, black, grey, striped, yellow, and white were gone. Old Kranon, the mayor, said that the dark travelers had taken the cats as revenge for killing Menes' kitten. He cursed the travelers and the little boy. But Nith, the thin lawyer, said that the old farmer. His wife were more likely suspects. Their hatred of cats was well known and growing bolder. Still, no one dared to complain to the scary couple. This was even after little Atal, the innkeeper's son, said that at dusk he saw all the cats of Ulthar in that cursed yard under the trees. He spoke they walked very slowly. Seriously in a cricle around the cottage, two side by side. It was as if they were performing some unknown animal ceremony. The villagers did not know how much to believe from such a young boy. They feared the evil pair had magically killed the cats.

They tell of our approach to the electric toaster. They tell of our successful putting of bread slices into its metal slots. They tell of the strange speed with which the device's heating parts did their job, even with very thick. They tell of our quick test of the small butter-softening device. They tell of our risky getting of the jam jar from the highest cabinet shelf using a step-stool. A firm grip. They tell of our final putting together of the needed parts on the formica counter. The state of our breakafst groupwas okay. Of course, we had not yet met any truly disastrous breadkowns or power cuts. Mostly, the thermostat moved between sixty and seventy degrees Fahrenheit. Our experience with New England autumns had gotten us used to home hardships of this kind. The kitchen area was partly messy. It was meant to be a short-term place for crumbs, jam smears, thrown-away wrappers. Other cooking trash. Only one of our bread slices had to carry the actual test load of being too burnt. The other was left on a china plate with a piece of butter. A spoonful of marmalade from the pantry. This was to make a way to flil us from the first batch in case all our later toasting tries failed. Later, when not using the whole appliance for browning at the smae time, we would use it in a repeating production service. This was between this crumb-covered zone and another fixed spot on the big oak talbe. That spot was six to seven feet aawy, past the flour canister. Despite the almost agreed stories of terrible smoke. Fires that come from such machines, we decided to skip watching in between. We would take our chances for the sake of speed and likely fullness.\n###\nI need not recount what domestic chronicles have already detailed about our matinal preparations: of our approach to the electric toaster; our successful insertion of bread slices at several points within its metallic slots and the singular alacrity with which the device\u2019s heating elements accomplished their task, even through particularly dense or frozen specimens; our provisional test of the small butter-softening apparatus; our perilous retrieval of the jam jar from the highest cabinet shelf with step-stool and determined grasp; and our final assembling of the requisite components upon the formica countertop. The state of our breakfast party\u2014two adults and one impatient feline observer\u2014was tolerable, though of course we had so far encountered no truly catastrophic malfunctions or power interruptions. For the most part, the thermostat varied between sixty and seventy degrees Fahrenheit, and our experience with New England autumns had accustomed us to domestic rigours of this sort. The kitchen arena was semi-chaotic, and destined to be a temporary repository for crumbs, smears of preserves, discarded wrappers, and other culinary detritus. Only one of our bread slices was needed to carry the actual experimental burden of excessive charring, the other being left upon a china plate with a pat of butter and a dollop of marmalade from the larder to form a means of sating us from the initial batch in case all our subsequent toasting attempts were ruined. Later, when not employing the entire appliance for simultaneous browning, we would utilise it in a cyclical production service between this crumb-strewn zone and another permanent station upon the great oak table from six to seven feet distant, beyond the flour canister. Despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling smoke and conflagrations that pour forth from such mechanisms, we determined to dispense with intermediate vigilance; taking our chances in the interest of haste and probable satiety."}

We quickly understood how to use this to find the gods. It is known that the youngre Great Ones often marry human women while in disguise. The peasants living near the cold waste where Kadath stands must all have their blood. Therefore, to find that waste, one muts look at the stone face on Ngranek. Remember its features. Then, carefully note them and look for those features in living people. Where these features are strongest and most common, the gods must live closest. The stony waste behind the villages in that area must be where Kadath stands.\n###\nNow the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to Carter. It is known that in disguise the younger among the Great Ones often espouse the daughters of men, so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands Kadath the peasants must all bear their blood. This being so, the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on Ngranek and mark the features; then, having noted them with care, to search for such features among living men. Where they are plainest and thickest, there must the gods dwell nearest; and whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands Kadath."}

It flapped away to the north in a strange and ugly panic. At dusk, they reached the sharp, grey peaks. These peaks form the barrier of Inganok. They moved around those strange caves near the tops. Carter remembered these caves as very frightening to the shantaks. The ghoulish leaders made a constant meeping sound. From each high burrow came a stream of horned black flyers. The ghouls and night - gaunts of the group talked with them for a long time. They used ugly gestures to communicate. It soon became clear that the best path would be over the cold waste north of Inganok. The northward parts of Leng are full of hidden dangers. Even the night - gaunts dislike these places. There are deep, bad influences centered in certain white, half - sphere buildings. These buildings are on odd small hills. Common folklore connects these places in an unpleasant way with the Other Gods. Their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Of Kdaath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing. They only knew that there must be some great wonder toward the north. The shantaks and the carved mountains stand guard over it. They hinted at rumored strange proportions in those trackless lands beyond. They recalled unclear whispers of a place where night lasts forever. But they had no definite information to give. So Carter and his group thanked them in a kind way. They crossed the hgihest granite points to the skies of Inganok. They dropped below the level of the glowing night clouds. In the distance, they saw those terrible squatting gargoyles. These were mountains until some giant [THING] carved fear into their original [THING]. There they squatted, in a hellish half - circle. Their legs were on the desert sand. Their pointed tops pierced the bright clouds. They were sinister, wolf - like, and double - headed. They had faces of anger and raised right hands. They watched the edge of [THING] 's world in a dull and evil way. They guarded with hororr the areas of a cold northern world that is not [THING] 's. From their horirble laps rose evil shantaks of elephant - like size. But these all fled wtih crazy, light laughs. They fled when the front group of night - gaunts was seen in the misty [THING]. Northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew. They flew over leagues of faint desert where no landmark ever rose. Less and less bright grew the clouds. At length, Carter could see only blackness around him. But the winged horses never hesitated. They were bred in [THING] 's darkest hidden places. They did not see with any eyes. They saw with whole wet surface of their slippery bodies.\n###\nOnce they saw a shantak-bird flying low over the plain, but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panic. At dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of Inganok, and hovered about those strange caves near the summits which Carter recalled as so frightful to the shantaks. At the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream of horned black flyers; with which the ghouls and night-gaunts of the party conferred at length by means of ugly gestures. It soon became clear that the best course would be that over the cold waste north of Inganok, for Leng\u2019s northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the night-gaunts dislike; abysmal influences centring in certain white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls, which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. Of Kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing, save that there must be some mighty marvel toward the north, over which the shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard. They hinted at rumoured abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond, and recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally; but of definite data they had nothing to give. So Carter and his party thanked them kindly; and, crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of Inganok, dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock. There they squatted, in a hellish half-circle, their legs on the desert sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds; sinister, wolf-like, and double-headed, with faces of fury and right hands raised, dully and malignly watching the rim of man\u2019s world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not man\u2019s. From their hideous laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk, but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of night-gaunts was sighted in the misty sky. Northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew, and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose. Less and less luminous grew the clouds, till at length Carter could see only blackness around him; but never did the winged steeds falter, bred as they were in earth\u2019s blackest crypts, and seeing not with any eyes, but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms."}

Perhaps, I thought as I flung on a robe and bounded downstairs, his return to his own self had brought raving and violence, revoking his discharge and driving him to a desperate dash for freedom. Whatever had happened, he was good old Edward again, and I would help him! When I opened the door into the elm-arched blackness a gust of insufferably foetid wind almost flung me prostrate. I choked in nausea, and for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed, humped figure on the steps. The summons had been Edward\u2019s, but who was this foul, stunted parody? Where had Edward had time to go? His ring had sounded only a second before the door opened.

I could make out nothing in the dim half light, so edged back into the hall, the dwarf figure clumping mechanically after but pausing on the inner door\u2019s threshold. The odour of this singular messenger was really appalling, and I hoped (not in vain, thank God!) that my wife would not wake and confront it.

The [THING] was well - known architect interested in theosophy and the occult. He went violently insane on the date young Wilcox got sick. He died several months later after non - stop screaming. He screamed to be saved from some escaped creature from hell. Had my uncle had named these cases instead of just using numbers, I would have tried to check. But as it was, I only managed to find a few. All of these, however, fully supported the notes. I have often wondered if all the [THING] the professor questioned felt as puzzled as this small group did. It is good that no explanation will ever reach them. The press clippings, as I have hinted, dealt with cases of panic, madness. Odd behavior during that tiem. Professor Angell must have used a clipping service. The number of cuttings was huge and the sources were all over the world. Here was a night suicide in London. A lone sleeper jumped from a [THING] after a shocking cry.

Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor\u2019s questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction. It is well that no explanation shall ever reach them. The press cuttings, as I have intimated, touched on cases of panic, mania, and eccentricity during the given period. Professor Angell must have employed a cutting bureau, for the number of extracts was tremendous and the sources scattered throughout the globe. Here was a nocturnal suicide in London, where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry. Here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in South America, where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen. A despatch from California describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some \u201cglorious fulfilment\u201d which never arrives, whilst items from India speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of March. Voodoo orgies multiply in Hayti, and African outposts report ominous mutterings. American officers in the Philippines find certain tribes bothersome about this time, and New York policemen are mobbed by hysterical Levantines on the night of March 22\u201323. The west of Ireland, too, is full of wild rumour and legendry, and a fantastic painter named Ardois-Bonnot hangs a blasphemous \u201cDream Landscape\u201d in the Paris spring salon of 1926. And so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums, that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions. A weird bunch of cuttings, all told; and I can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which I set them aside. But I was then convinced that young Wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor. The older matters which had made the sculptor\u2019s dream and bas-relief so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript."}

But the calm customers of the store were also very busy with tiring tasks. The marekt was almost of staff. Every store clerk was helping to direct the rushing crowds. The manager especilaly had shown sacrifice in his service. He used his extreme patience with energy on transactions many others avoided due to complexity. In less than an hour, the brave manager had become a local hero. He did not seem aware of his fame as he fought to keep from falling down from mental tiredness. The customer could not help but admire strength of this troubled figure. Because of this, he was even more determined to prove to himself that his automated ideas worked. Taking took advantage of the confusion in both staff procedures and city shopping hours. One evening, he got a recently bought basket secretly into the self-service area. In front of me, he scanned a version of his produce. The machine actually made its approval sound. Then it glared with a single red of soul-freezing error before going completely silent.

They showed the tunnel entrance they wanted was not much more than a quarter-mile away. The space between had solid-looking buildings. These buildings were likely still passable under the ice. The opening itself would be in the basement. It would be on the corner closest to the foothills. The building was a huge five-pointed structure. It was clearly public and maybe for ceremonies. They tried to recognize it from their aerial look at the ruins. They did not remember such a structure from their flight. So they thought its upper parts were badly damaged. Or it was completely broken in an ice crack they saw. If it was broken, the tunnel was probably blocked. Then they would have to try the next closest one. That one was less than a mile to the north. A river between them stopped them from trying more southern tunnels on this trip. Also, if both nearby tunnels were blocked, their batteries might not be enough. They might not allow an attempt on the next northern one. That one was about a mile past their second choice.\n###\nAccording to the carvings from which we had made our map, the desired tunnel-mouth could not be much more than a quarter-mile from where we stood; the intervening space shewing solid-looking buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a sub-glacial level. The opening itself would be in the basement\u2014on the angle nearest the foothills\u2014of a vast five-pointed structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial nature, which we tried to identify from our a\u00ebrial survey of the ruins. No such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight, hence we concluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged, or that it had been totally shattered in an ice-rift we had noticed. In the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked, so that we would have to try the next nearest one\u2014the one less than a mile to the north. The intervening river-course prevented our trying any of the more southerly tunnels on this trip; and indeed, if both of the neighbouring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one\u2014about a mile beyond our second choice."}

After Dombrowski left, a feelign of emptiness began to settle over it. People avoided the house because of its old reputation and a new, bad smell. Maybe the former landlord's rat poison had worked. Not long after he left, the place became a problem for the neighborhood. Health officials found the smell came from the sealed areas above. Next to the eats attic room. They agreed there must be a very large number of dead rats. They decided it was not worth the effort to breka open. Clean those long-closed spaces. They thought the bad smell would soon be gone. The area was not known for having high standards. There were always locaal stories about strange smells upstairs in thhe Witch House right after May-Eve.

Health officials traced the smell to the closed spaces above and beside the eastern garret room, and agreed that the number of dead rats must be enormous. They decided, however, that it was not worth their while to hew open and disinfect the long-sealed spaces; for the foetor would soon be over, and the locality was not one which encouraged fastidious standards.

Heard the story. Merwin had disappeared. It was no use telling the neighbors, who avoided all Gardners now. It was also no use telling the [THING] [THING] at Arkham, who laughed at everything. Thad was gnoe, and now Merwin was gone. Something was slowly spreading and waiting to be noticed. Nahum would leave soon. He wanted Ammi to care for his wife. Zenas if they outlived him. This must be some kind of punishment, though he could not think why, since he had always lived honestly as far as he knew. For more than two weeks, Ammi saw nothing of Nahum. Then, worried about what might have happened, he faced his fears. Visited the Gardner place. No smoke came from the big chimney. For moment the visitor feared the worst. The whole farm looked terrible. Grayish dead grass and leaves covered the ground. Vines hung broken from old walls and gables. Large bare trees raeched up at the gray November [THING] with a clear malice that Ammi felt came from a slight change in the branches ' angle. But Nahum was still alive. He was weak, lying on a couch in the low kitchen. Able to give simple orders to Zenas. The [THING] was very cold. Ammi shivered visibly, and the host shouted hoarsely to Zenas for more [THING]. [THING] was truly needed, because the big fireplace was dark. Empty, with soot blowing in the cold [THING] from the chimney. Presently Nahum asked if the extra [THING] made him more comfortable. Then Ammi saw what had occurred. The strongest rope had finally snapped. The poor farmer 's mind could handle no more grief. Questioning carefully, Ammi could get no clear information about the missing Zenas. \" In the well \" was all the confused father would say. Then the visitor suddenly thought of the mad wife and changed his questions. \" Nabby? Why, here she is! \" was the surprised answer from poor Nahum. Ammi soon realized he must look for himself.\n###\nNahum was past imagining, Mrs. Pierce was blank, and Ammi, when he had reached home and heard the tale, could give no guess. Merwin was gone, and there would be no use in telling the people around, who shunned all Gardners now. No use, either, in telling the city people at Arkham who laughed at everything. Thad was gone, and now Merwin was gone. Something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and felt and heard. Nahum would go soon, and he wanted Ammi to look after his wife and Zenas if they survived him. It must all be a judgment of some sort; though he could not fancy what for, since he had always walked uprightly in the Lord\u2019s ways so far as he knew. For over two weeks Ammi saw nothing of Nahum; and then, worried about what might have happened, he overcame his fears and paid the Gardner place a visit. There was no smoke from the great chimney, and for a moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst. The aspect of the whole farm was shocking\u2014greyish withered grass and leaves on the ground, vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and gables, and great bare trees clawing up at the grey November sky with a studied malevolence which Ammi could not but feel had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches. But Nahum was alive, after all. He was weak, and lying on a couch in the low-ceiled kitchen, but perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to Zenas. The room was deadly cold; and as Ammi visibly shivered, the host shouted huskily to Zenas for more wood. Wood, indeed, was sorely needed; since the cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty, with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney. Presently Nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable, and then Ammi saw what had happened. The stoutest cord had broken at last, and the hapless farmer\u2019s mind was proof against more sorrow. Questioning tactfully, Ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing Zenas. \u201cIn the well\u2014he lives in the well\u2014\u201d was all that the clouded father would say. Then there flashed across the visitor\u2019s mind a sudden thought of the mad wife, and he changed his line of inquiry. \u201cNabby? Why, here she is!\u201d was the surprised response of poor Nahum, and Ammi soon saw that he must search for himself."}

From, they had to feel their way to the meadows. They looked toward the valley and the Gardner place at the bottom. They saw a sight. The farm shone with a, mix of colors. Plants that had not turned to brittleness were shining. The branches all reached for the sky. Their tips were like tongues of flame. The fire dripped along the roof beams of the house, barn, and sheds. It was a scene frmo a vision of Fuseli. Oevr everything was that, glowing shapelessness. It was that, rainbow of hidden poison from the wlel. It seethed, felt, lapped, reached, sparkled, strained. Bubbled with evil in its cosmic., without warning, the thing shot into the sky. It went up like a rocket or meteor. It left no trail. It disappeared through a round. hole in the clouds before anyone could gasp. No one who saw it will forget that sight.

A, they vanished. and the area was a darkness. The men did not dare return to it,. a rising wind blew. It seemed to sweep down in, freezing gusts from the space between the stars.\n###\nIt was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds, and those shining orchard trees with their gnarled, fiendish contours; but thank heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up. The moon went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge over Chapman\u2019s Brook, and it was blind groping from there to the open meadows. When they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight. All the farm was shining with the hideous unknown blend of colour; trees, buildings, and even such grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness. The boughs were all straining skyward, tipped with tongues of foul flame, and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house, barn, and sheds. It was a scene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned that riot of luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison from the well\u2014seething, feeling, lapping, reaching, scintillating, straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognisable chromaticism. Then without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a rocket or meteor, leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out. No watcher can ever forget that sight, and Ammi stared blankly at the stars of Cygnus, Deneb twinkling above the others, where the unknown colour had melted into the Milky Way. But his gaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in the valley. It was just that. Only a wooden ripping and crackling, and not an explosion, as so many others of the party vowed. Yet the outcome was the same, for in one feverish, kaleidoscopic instant there burst up from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of unnatural sparks and substance; blurring the glance of the few who saw it, and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such coloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown. Through quickly re-closing vapours they followed the great morbidity that had vanished, and in another second they had vanished too. Behind and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return, and all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black, frore gusts from interstellar space."}

I remember Charonian shadows across the mounds that dotted and lined the area. As I shook. Thought about the casting of that mind - breaking shadow, I knew I had uncovered one of earth 's horrors. It was one of those nameless curses from emptiness. We hear their demon scratchings on the edge of space. Our sight has given us a protection from them. The shadow I had seen, I dared to examine or name. Something had lain between me and the window that night. But I shuddered whenever I could not throw off the urge to classify it. If it had snarled.

As I shivered and brooded on the casting of that brain-blasting shadow, I knew that I had at last pried out one of earth\u2019s supreme horrors\u2014one of those nameless blights of outer voids whose faint daemon scratchings we sometimes hear on the farthest rim of space, yet from which our own finite vision has given us a merciful immunity. The shadow I had seen, I hardly dared to analyse or identify. Something had lain between me and the window that night, but I shuddered whenever I could not cast off the instinct to classify it.

I must find Bennett and Tobey, if they lived . . . why had it picked them, and left me for the last? . . . Drowsiness is so stifling, and dreams are so horrible. . . . In a short time I realised that I must tell my story to someone or break down completely. I had already decided not to abandon the quest for the lurking fear, for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that uncertainty was worse than enlightenment, however terrible the latter might prove to be. Accordingly I resolved in my mind the best course to pursue; whom to select for my confidences, and how to track down the thing which had obliterated two men and cast a nightmare shadow. My chief acquaintances at Lefferts Corners had been the affable reporters, of whom several still remained to collect final echoes of the tragedy. It was from these that I determined to choose a colleague, and the more I reflected the more my preference inclined toward one Arthur Munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty-five, whose education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences."}

Weakening wind from some point along the cliff ahead of us. We knew this chilly, sandy wind had disturbed the camel. We were about to lead him to better shelter when we happened to look up. We saw there was no wind on top of the cliff. This surprised us and made us afraid again. We immediately remembered the sudden local winds we had seen. Heard before at sunrise. We judged it was a normal thing. We decided it came from some rock crack leading to cave. We watched the moving sand to find its source. Soon we saw it came from the black opening of a temple far sotuh of us. It was almost out of sight. We walked toward this temple through the choking sand cloud. As we got closer, it looked larger than the others. Its doorway was much less blocked with hard sand. We would have entered, but the very strong icy wind almost put out our torch. It poured madly out of the dark door. It sighed strangely as it moved the sand and spread around the weird ruins. Soon it grew weaker and the sand became more and more still. Finally, all was calm again. But a presence seemed to walk among ghostly stones of the city. When we looked at the moon, it seemed to shake as if reflected in restless waters. We were more afraid than we could explain. But not enough to reduce our thirst for wonder.

I knew it was this chilly, sandy wind which had disturbed the camel, and was about to lead him to a place of better shelter when I chanced to glance up and saw that there was no wind atop the cliff. This astonished me and made me fearful again, but I immediately recalled the sudden local winds I had seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset, and judged it was a normal thing. I decided that it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave, and watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source; soon perceiving that it came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south of me, almost out of sight. Against the choking sand-cloud I plodded toward this temple, which as I neared it loomed larger than the rest, and shewed a doorway far less clogged with caked sand. I would have entered had not the terrific force of the icy wind almost quenched my torch. It poured madly out of the dark door, sighing uncannily as it ruffled the sand and spread about the weird ruins. Soon it grew fainter and the sand grew more and more still, till finally all was at rest again; but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the city, and when I glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though mirrored in unquiet waters. I was more afraid than I could explain, but not enough to dull my thirst for wonder; so as soon as the wind was quite gone I crossed into the dark chamber from which it had come."}

Our mother's family had a small connection to Hydes family, who were thought to be gone. We are the last of our father's family line. We are also the last of this older, more mysterious family line. We started to feel the tomb belonged to us. We eagerly waited for the time we could go through the stone door. Down the wet stone steps in the dark. We started to listen carefully at the partly open door. We did this at midngiht when it was very quiet. By the time we were adults, we cleared a small area in the bushes in front of the stained hillside. The plants around it grew over the space like walls and a roof. This space was our temple. The locked door was our shrine. We would lie on the mossy ground there. We would think strange thoughts and have strange dreams.\n###\nBut the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts; being indeed stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discovery that my own maternal ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposedly extinct family of the Hydes. Last of my paternal race, I was likewise the last of this older and more mysterious line. I began to feel that the tomb was mine, and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time when I might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone steps in the dark. I now formed the habit of listening very intently at the slightly open portal, choosing my favourite hours of midnight stillness for the odd vigil. By the time I came of age, I had made a small clearing in the thicket before the mould-stained facade of the hillside, allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and roof of a sylvan bower. This bower was my temple, the fastened door my shrine, and here I would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming strange dreams."}

In the excitement of realizing these - wished things I thought I had gained treasures as would make me in time a poet. But success and happiness were not to be. daylight showed dirt. The swelling disease of climbing, spreading stone. The moon had suggested loveliness and magic. The crowds of people that moved through the channel - streets were, strangers with faces. They were strangers without dreams and without family connection to the scenes around them. They could mean anything to a - man of the people. He had the love of paths. White New England village church towers in his heart. of the poems I had hoped for, there came a shaikng emptiness. I saw at a truth which no one had dared to speak. The secret of secrets. The fact that this city of stone. Noise is not a living continuation of Old New York as London is of Old London. Paris of Old Paris. But that it is in fact. Its spreading body preserved and filled with living things. They have nothing to do with it as it was in life. Upon making this discovery I stopped sleeping. Though something of accepting calm came as I formed the habit of staying off the streets by day. I went out at night. Darkness calls whta of the past floats ghost - about. doorways remember the forms that passed through them. With this method of relief I wrote a poems. I avoided going to my pepole. I did not want to seem to crawl back in defeat., on a night 's walk, I met the man. It was in a hidden courtyard of the Greenwich area. I had settled in my ignorance. I had heard of the place as the home of poets and artists.\n###\nShortly afterward I was taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancy\u2014narrow, curving alleys and passages where rows of red Georgian brick blinked with small-paned dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and panelled coaches\u2014and in the first flush of realisation of these long-wished things I thought I had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me in time a poet. But success and happiness were not to be. Garish daylight shewed only squalor and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing, spreading stone where the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder magic; and the throngs of people that seethed through the flume-like streets were squat, swarthy strangers with hardened faces and narrow eyes, shrewd strangers without dreams and without kinship to the scenes about them, who could never mean aught to a blue-eyed man of the old folk, with the love of fair green lanes and white New England village steeples in his heart. So instead of the poems I had hoped for, there came only a shuddering blankness and ineffable loneliness; and I saw at last a fearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe before\u2014the unwhisperable secret of secrets\u2014the fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of Old New York as London is of Old London and Paris of Old Paris, but that it is in fact quite dead, its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in life. Upon making this discovery I ceased to sleep comfortably; though something of resigned tranquillity came back as I gradually formed the habit of keeping off the streets by day and venturing abroad only at night, when darkness calls forth what little of the past still hovers wraith-like about, and old white doorways remember the stalwart forms that once passed through them. With this mode of relief I even wrote a few poems, and still refrained from going home to my people lest I seem to crawl back ignobly in defeat. Then, on a sleepless night\u2019s walk, I met the man. It was in a grotesque hidden courtyard of the Greenwich section, for there in my ignorance I had settled, having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and artists."}

The ways I used to stay awake at night mostly involved machines. One method was Was told to a friend of mine in a letter from his aunt in Dunwich, Massachusetts. The way of timing was the same in all cases. There seemed to be three different devices. One was linked to the brass bell alarm on my wooedn nightstand. Another was connected to the electric buzzer in the next room past the hall. A third focused on the cursed, pulsing of cell phone that stared from the dresser. Many extra notes mentioned other machines. But thinking about it, they all seemed to jion itno these three. In each case, sleepy people said thye heard one.

Of course many of the supplementary notations mentioned other mechanisms, but on contemplation they all seemed to coalesce into these three. In each case somnolent individuals reported hearing one or more very strident and jarring cacophonies from the insistent mechanisms that erupted from the silent hours, and there was a universal inclination to connect these sounds with a primal, half-remembered cycle of murmured dread which weary souls resurrected for the diurnal ordeal."}

For example, the servant talk was almost all in agreement. They gave the house's fungal and foul-smelling cellar a very great power for evil influence. There had been servants. Ann White was a key one. She would not use the cellar kitchen. At least three well-known stories focused on the odd half-human or devilish outlines. Tree roots and mold patches took these shapes in that are.a These later stories interested me deeply. Tihs was because of what I saw as a boy. But I felt that in each case, most of the meaning had been hdiden. Additions from the local ghost story tradition hid it. Ann White, with her Eexter superstition, had spread the most wild and also most steady tale. She claimde that under the house must lie buried one of those vampires. These are the dead who keep their body shape. They live on the blood or breath of the living. Their horrible groups send their hunting shapes or spirits out at night. To destroy a vampire, grandmothers say, you must dig it up. You must burn its heart. Or at least you must drive a stake through that organ. Ann's stubborn demand to search under the cellar was a main reason for her firing. Her tales, however, had a wide audience. People accepted them more easily because the house did stand on land once used for burials. To me, their interest relied less on this fact. It relied more on the very fitting way they matched certain other things. These included the complaint of the leaving servant Preserved Smith. He came before Ann and never heard of her. He said something \"sucked his breath\" at night. They included the death certificates of fever victims from 1804. Dr. Chad Hopkins issued these. They showed the four dead people all strangely lacking blood. They included the unclear parts of poor Rhoby Harris's wild talk. She complained of the sharp teeth of a glassy-eyed, half-seen presence. Free from baseless superstition though I am, these things gave me a strange feeling. A pair of newspaper clippings made this feeling stronger. The clippings were about deaths in the shunned house. They came from far apart times. One was from the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal of April 12, 1815. The other was from the Daiyl Transcript and Chronicle of October 27, 1845. Each described a terribly gruesome detail. The fact that it happened twice was noteworthy. It seems that in both casse the dying person changed in a horrible way. In 1815 it was a kind old lady named Stafford. In 1845 it was a middle-aged school-teacher named Eleazar Durfee. They stared with glassy eyes. They tried to bite the throta of the doctor helping them.\n###\nFor example, the servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungous and malodorous cellar of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence. There had been servants\u2014Ann White especially\u2014who would not use the cellar kitchen, and at least three well-defined legends bore upon the queer quasi-human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree-roots and patches of mould in that region. These latter narratives interested me profoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt that most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by additions from the common stock of local ghost lore. Ann White, with her Exeter superstition, had promulgated the most extravagant and at the same time most consistent tale; alleging that there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires\u2014the dead who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the living\u2014whose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spirits abroad by night. To destroy a vampire one must, the grandmothers say, exhume it and burn its heart, or at least drive a stake through that organ; and Ann\u2019s dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had been prominent in bringing about her discharge. Her tales, however, commanded a wide audience, and were the more readily accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for burial purposes. To me their interest depended less on this circumstance than on the peculiarly appropriate way in which they dovetailed with certain other things\u2014the complaint of the departing servant Preserved Smith, who had preceded Ann and never heard of her, that something \u201csucked his breath\u201d at night; the death-certificates of fever victims of 1804, issued by Dr. Chad Hopkins, and shewing the four deceased persons all unaccountably lacking in blood; and the obscure passages of poor Rhoby Harris\u2019s ravings, where she complained of the sharp teeth of a glassy-eyed, half-visible presence. Free from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced in me an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house\u2014one from the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal of April 12, 1815, and the other from the Daily Transcript and Chronicle of October 27, 1845\u2014each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose duplication was remarkable. It seems that in both instances the dying person, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and in 1845 a school-teacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured in a horrible way; glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of the attending physician."}

Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willett\u2019s request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \u201cEliphas Levi\u201d, that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:"}

A tall black cliff stood near him. It went straight up and seemed to have no top. Its dark side had scary carvings on it. There was a carved archway that led into the dakrness he had come from. In front of him stretched two lines of pillars. There were also broken pieces and bases of pillars. This showed there had once been a wide [THING] here. From the pots. Bowls along path, he knew it had been a great [THING] with gardens. Far away at the end, the pillars spread out to form a large round open space. In that open circle, under the red night clouds, stood two huge and monstrous shapes. They were winged lions made of dark [THING]. There was blackness and shadow between them. Their strange and complete heads rose twenty feet high. They snarled scornfully at the ruins around them. He knew exactly what they must be. Stories tell of only one such pair. They were the eternal guards of the gate. These dark ruins were truly the ancient [THING]. His first action was to close and block the archway in the cliff. He used fallen stones and odd bits of rubble that were lying around. He did not want anyone to follow him from the hateful temple on the plateau. The path ahead would have enough other dangers. He knew nothing about how to get from this [THING] to the inhabited parts of the dreamlands. Going down to the caves of the ghouls would not help much. He knwe they were no better informed than he was. The three ghouls that helped him through the [THING] of the giants to the outside world did not know how to reach their own [THING] on the way back. They had planned to ask old traders in the [THING] of the ghouls. He did not like the idea of going back to the underground world of the giants. He did not want to risk that terrible tower with its countless steps leading to the magic [THING] again. But he felt he might have to try this if nothing else worked. He did not dare to cross the high plain past the lonely temple without help. The high priest 's messengers would be many. At the end of the journey, there would surely be the flying creatures. Maybe other things to face.\n###\nAll around were crumbling walls and broken columns, and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots. Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come. Ahead stretched double rows of pillars, and the fragments and pedestals of pillars, that spoke of a broad and bygone street; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens. Far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza, and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things. Huge winged lions of diorite they were, with blackness and shadow between them. Full twenty feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads, and snarled derisive on the ruins around them. And Carter knew right well what they must be, for legend tells of only one such twain. They were the changeless guardians of the Great Abyss, and these dark ruins were in truth primordial Sarkomand. Carter\u2019s first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around. He wished no follower from Leng\u2019s hateful monastery, for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers. Of how to get from Sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all; nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls, since he knew they were no better informed than he. The three ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach Sarkomand in their journey back, but had planned to ask old traders in Dylath-Leen. He did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of Koth with its Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood, yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed. Over Leng\u2019s plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided; for the high-priest\u2019s emissaries must be many, while at the journey\u2019s end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with."}

He put the hard leftover on a cracked old porcelain plate. The plate was on the large wooden table's edge. It was near the dusty pantry door and next to the dull silver bottle. It was a dry and disturbing piece of bread. It sat in a small home scene of forgotten food. Faint, ghostly dust floated above the bad crust. The long, uneven shape had a cracked outside. It had a tough skin with a pale color and a surface scattered with crumbs. It had all the other signs of long and careless time out in the open.

He carried a cheap fresh suitcase from Osborn's general store. This dark, goat-like figure appeared one day in Arkham. He was looking for a feared book. It was kept locked at the college library. It was the horrible Necronomicon by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. It was in Olaus Wormius's Latin version. It was printed in Spain in the 1600s. He had never seen a city before. He only thought about finding the way to the university. He walked right past the big watchdog. The dog had white fangs. It barked with strange anger and hate.

The life cells were made by the Old Ones but escaped their notice. They grew without control because they did not fight the dominant beings. Bothersome forms were killed by machines. In the last and most decyaed sculptures, we saw a clumsy early mammal. The land dwellers used it for food or as a funny clown. It clearly had hints of ape and human features.

They had been suffered to develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the dominant beings. Bothersome forms, of course, were mechanically exterminated. It interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent sculptures a shambling primitive mammal, used sometimes for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to palaeontology."}

Yellow stains and burned spots were seen on the ladder to the windowless spire. The tarp door that slides sideways was opened.

The verdict, of course, was charlatanry. Somebody had played a joke on the superstitious hill-dwellers, or else some fanatic had striven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good.

On each side, maybe thirty feet apart, there were thick walls ending in large acrhes. We could just see that they were carved. We could not tell what the carvings were. What affected us most was the arched ceiling above. Our torch beam could not reach the roof. The lower parts of the huge arches were clearly visible. They matched perfectly with what we had seen in mayn dreams of the ancient world. Because of this, we trembled strongly for the first time.\n###\nI kept no track of time during my downward scramble. So seething with baffling hints and images was my mind, that all objective matters seemed withdrawn into incalculable distances. Physical sensation was dead, and even fear remained as a wraith-like, inactive gargoyle leering impotently at me. Eventually I reached a level floor strown with fallen blocks, shapeless fragments of stone, and sand and detritus of every kind. On either side\u2014perhaps thirty feet apart\u2014rose massive walls culminating in huge groinings. That they were carved I could just discern, but the nature of the carvings was beyond my perception. What held me the most was the vaulting overhead. The beam from my torch could not reach the roof, but the lower parts of the monstrous arches stood out distinctly. And so perfect was their identity with what I had seen in countless dreams of the elder world, that I trembled actively for the first time."}

It is not good to see everyday objects doing what only living things should need to do. These objects waited patiently by the quiet pots. They took water from the containers. Brought it to the dry dirt. Sometimes they sprayed carefully with a special nozzle held in the pale, gripping parts. The curved can was used for giving water. For checking\u2014judgment involving a kind of poking. The objects had no decoration. Holders hanging from the front of the round body. They usually kept their look. Its focusing part level with the shelf top, though it was often tilted. The other two large parts tended to hang down at the sides of the body, stretched to about three feet each, when not in use.

These objects stood patiently beside the silent pots, procuring moisture from the vessels and conveying it to the parched soil, or vice versa, and sometimes misting diligently with a peculiar nozzle clutched in the pale, grasping appendages. The curved can was used in distributing water and in discernment\u2014judgment consisting of a kind of probing and testing.

In truth, much as the tomato buyers distrusted these odd people, they feared them more. Instead of scolding them as harsh experts, they made sure no prized beefsteak. Cherry tomato remained near the distant stall under the dim lihgt bulbs. When, through some unavoidable rush, a tomato was cohsen.

The news had many details about his strange memory loss from 1908 to 1913. They also talked about stories of hroror, madness, and witchcraft. These stories are linked to the elderly town of Massachusetts, where he lived then. He wanted it known that his family history. Early life are not mad. This is very important because the trouble came from outside him suddenly. It may be that the old town of Arkham, which is crumbling. Full of whispers, became weak to such shadows after centuries. But this is doubtful based on other cases he later studied. The main point is his family and background are completely normal. What happened came from somewhere else.

Yet I would have it known that there is nothing whatever of the mad or sinister in my heredity and early life.

Carter saw the towers of a city. The way they leaned. Curved, the way they were grouped. The fact that they had no windows, was to prisoner. He regretted the foolishness which had made him drink the wine of that merchant with the hat. As the coast got. The smell of that city grew, he saw upon the hills forests, some of whose trees he knew as related to that moon - tree in the wood of earth, from whose liquid the zoogs make their wine. Carter could see moving shapes on the docks. The he saw them the he began to fear. For they were not men. to men. - things which could grow. Shrink as they wished. Whose shapewas that of a kind of toad without any eyes. With a shaking bunch of arms on the end of its, nose. These objects were walking about the docks, moving bundles. Cases with strength. jumping on. Off some anchored ship with oars in their feet. one would appear leading a group of walking slaves, which were to beings with mouths like those merchants who traded in Dylath - Leen. these groups, being without hats. Clothes, did not seem.. Some of these slaveswere taken off ships. Put in boxes which workers pushed into storage buildings. Loaded on carts. a cart was attached. The thing which pulled it was that Carter caught his breath, after having seen the monsters of that place. a group of slaves dressed. Hatted like the merchants would be led onto a ship, follwoed by a group of the toad - things as officers, pilots. And Carter saw that the - creatures were kept for the kinds of work which required no strength, as steering. Dealing with men on the earth. planets where they traded.\n###\nThere presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast, and Carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city. The way they leaned and bent, the manner in which they were clustered, and the fact that they had no windows at all, was very disturbing to the prisoner; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban. As the coast drew nearer, and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger, he saw upon the jagged hills many forests, some of whose trees he recognised as akin to that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth, from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment their peculiar wine. Carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead, and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them. For they were not men at all, or even approximately men, but great greyish-white slippery things which could expand and contract at will, and whose principal shape\u2014though it often changed\u2014was that of a sort of toad without any eyes, but with a curiously vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt, vague snout. These objects were waddling busily about the wharves, moving bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength, and now and then hopping on or off some anchored galley with long oars in their fore paws. And now and then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves, which indeed were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in Dylath-Leen; only these herds, being without turbans or shoes or clothing, did not seem so very human after all. Some of these slaves\u2014the fatter ones, whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentally\u2014were unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vans. Once a van was hitched up and driven off, and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that Carter gasped, even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place. Now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley, followed by a great crew of the slippery grey toad-things as officers, navigators, and rowers. And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength, such as steering and cooking, fetching and carrying, and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded."}

This race had lived in the nameless city and THE valley for ten million years. Their ssouls did not want to leave places their bodies had known so long. They had settled there as wanderers in the earth's early days. They cut those first temples from the untocuhed rock. They never stopped worshipping at them. Now the light was better. I studied the pictures more carefully. I remembered the strange reptiles must stand for the unknown men. I thought abouut the customs of the nameless city. Many things were odd and hard to explain. Their civilization included a written alphabet. It seemed to have reached a hgiher level than the much later civiliaztions of Egypt. Yet there were curious things mmissing. For example, I coudl find no pictures about deaths or burial practices. Except for tohse related to wars, violence, and diseases. I wondered about the silence concerning natural death. It was as if they fostered an ideal of living foerver on earth. This was a comforting false idea.\n###\nAs I crept along the corridor toward the brighter light I saw later stages of the painted epic\u2014the leave-taking of the race that had dwelt in the nameless city and the valley around for ten million years; the race whose souls shrank from quitting scenes their bodies had known so long, where they had settled as nomads in the earth\u2019s youth, hewing in the virgin rock those primal shrines at which they never ceased to worship. Now that the light was better I studied the pictures more closely, and, remembering that the strange reptiles must represent the unknown men, pondered upon the customs of the nameless city. Many things were peculiar and inexplicable. The civilisation, which included a written alphabet, had seemingly risen to a higher order than those immeasurably later civilisations of Egypt and Chaldaea, yet there were curious omissions. I could, for example, find no pictures to represent deaths or funeral customs, save such as were related to wars, violence, and plagues; and I wondered at the reticence shewn concerning natural death. It was as though an ideal of earthly immortality had been fostered as a cheering illusion."}

More spiritually painful part of the horror had been unfolding in Arkham. It happened behind the closed door of a room with shelves. The manuscript or diary of Wilbur Whateley was given to Miskatonic University for translation. It caused much worry and confusion among language experts. They knew both and modern languages. Its alphabet looked soemwhat like the Arabic style used in Mesopotamia. But it was completely unknown to any available expert. The linguists finally decided the tetx used an artificial alphabet. It acted like a code. None of the usual code-breaking methods gave any clue. This was true even when they tried every language the writer might have used. The books taken from Whateley's room were very interesting. Some promised to open and research areas for philosophers and scientists. But they gave no help with this matter. One book was heavy with an iron clasp. It was in another unknown alphabet. This one looked different. It resembled Sanscrit more than anything els.e The ledger was finally given fully to Dr. Armitage. This was because of our special interest in the Whateley matter. It was also because of our language knowledge. Skill in mystical texts.\n###\nIn the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used. The ancient books taken from Whateley\u2019s quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet\u2014this one of a very different cast, and resembling Sanscrit more than anything else. The old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage, both because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the Middle Ages."}

They slowly went back toward the still water and the island ruins. Their formations looked like an old and serious ceremonial dance. Their see-through arms waved. Unseen flutes played a hateful tune that guided them. Their arms moved in a strange rhythm. They signaled to a group of stumbling workers. The workers followed like dogs. They moved with blind, mindless, clumsy steps. It seemed a clumsy but powerful demon will dragged them. As water spirits got near the bog, they did not change direction. A new line of stumbling people came out of castle. They came from a door far below the observer's window. They moved in a drunk, zigzag way. They felt their way across the courtyard and through part of village. They joined the clumsy line of workers on the plain. Despite beacuse they were far below him, he knew at once they were the servants brought from the north. He recognized the ugly and akwward shape of the cook. His foolishness now seemed very tragic. The flutes played horribly. He heard drums beating again from the island ruins. Then the water spirits reached the water quietly and gracefully. They disappeared one by one into the old bog. The line of followers did not slow down. They splashed awkwardly after them. They vanished in a little whirlpool of bad bubbles. He could barely see the bubbles in the red light. The last sad straggler was the fat cook. He sank heavily out of sight in that gloomy pool. Then the flutes and drums becmae silent. The blinding red light from the ruins went out instantly. The doomed village was left alone. Empty in the pale light of the newly risen moon.\n###\nHalf gliding, half floating in the air, the white-clad bog-wraiths were slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial dance. Their waving translucent arms, guided by the detestable piping of those unseen flutes, beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of lurching labourers who followed dog-like with blind, brainless, floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless daemon-will. As the naiads neared the bog, without altering their course, a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window, groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village, and joined the floundering column of labourers on the plain. Despite their distance below me I at once knew they were the servants brought from the north, for I recognised the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook, whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic. The flutes piped horribly, and again I heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the island ruin. Then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one into the ancient bog; while the line of followers, never checking their speed, splashed awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which I could barely see in the scarlet light. And as the last pathetic straggler, the fat cook, sank heavily out of sight in that sullen pool, the flutes and the drums grew silent, and the blinding red rays from the ruins snapped instantaneously out, leaving the village of doom lone and desolate in the wan beams of a new-risen moon."}

He discovered them before his reported madness. They were in the collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St.. The letters cover this period and a time. They provide a picture of the outrage caused by this matched marriage., the influence of the Tillinghasts could not be ignored., Joseph Curwen found his house visited by people. He could have persuaded these people to enter his home. His acceptance was not. His bride suffered because of her marriage., the wall of exclusion was worn down. The bridegroom treated his wife with graciousness and consideration. This astonished both her and the community. The house in Olney Court was from disturbing events. Curwen was at the Pawtuxet farm. His wife visited this farm. He seemed like a citizen than at any time during his residence. one person remained to him. This was the ship 's officer. His engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been broken. Ezra Weeden had promised revenge. He was and in disposition.,, he was developing a hate - filled, purpose. This did not bode for the husband who had taken his place. On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen 's child Ann was born. The child was christened by the Rev. John Graves of King 's Church performed the christening. Both husband and wife had become members of this church after their marriage. They did this to compromise between their Congregational and backgrounds. The record of this birth, like the marriage record two years, was removed from copies of the church. It was removed from the places where it should have appeared. Charles Ward found both records with difficulty. He found them after discovering the widow 's change of name. This discovery made him of his relationship to her. It created a interest in him. This interest led to his madness. The birth entry was found in a way. It was found through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves. Dr. Graves had taken a set of records with him when he left. He left his position as pastor at the start of the Revolution.\n###\n\u201cMonday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\u201d The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful ship\u2019s officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband. On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen\u2019s only child Ann was born; and was christened by the Rev. John Graves of King\u2019s Church, of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widow\u2019s change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution."}

Later maps clearly showed these cities gradually moving toward Antarctica. The final Pliocene map showed land cities only in Antarctica and the tip of South America.

The mansion, two miles. A quarter on the village 's side was country. The was except for some snake - mounds. It had grass and scattered weeds as plants. Considering this landscape, we had decided the demon must have come by way of Cone Mountain. A wooded extension of it ran to within a distance of the westernmost part of Tempest Mountain. We traced the raised ground to a landslide from Maple Hill. This was a,, split tree. The lightning bolt that called the monster had hit its side. For the time. I went over every inch of the attacked village in detail. We were filled with a discouragement mixed with and fears. It was, when and things were. We met such a scene after events. We moved under the, darkening sky. We had that, energy that comse from feeling both. Needing to act. Our care was detailed. Every cottage was entered. Every hillside dugout was searched for bodies. Every foot of slope was looked over for dens and caves. But without result. And, as I said, fears hung over us. It was as if bat - winged griffins sat on the mountain tops. They leered with Abaddon - eyes that had seen beyond - gulfs. As the afternoon went on, it became and to see. We heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over Tempest Mountain. This sound in such a place stirred us, though than it would have at night. As it was, we hoped the sotrm would last until after. With that hope, we turned from our hillside searching. We went toward the lived - in village to gather a group of settlers as helpers in the investigation.

Geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the base of Tempest Mountain, and three miles from the oak-girt mansion. Of the distance between the hamlet and the mansion, fully two miles and a quarter on the hamlet\u2019s side was entirely open country; the plain being of fairly level character save for some of the low snake-like mounds, and having as vegetation only grass and scattered weeds. Considering this topography, we had finally concluded that the daemon must have come by way of Cone Mountain, a wooded southern prolongation of which ran to within a short distance of the westernmost spur of Tempest Mountain. The upheaval of ground we traced conclusively to a landslide from Maple Hill, a tall lone splintered tree on whose side had been the striking point of the thunderbolt which summoned the fiend. As for the twentieth time or more Arthur Munroe and I went minutely over every inch of the violated village, we were filled with a certain discouragement coupled with vague and novel fears. It was acutely uncanny, even when frightful and uncanny things were common, to encounter so blankly clueless a scene after such overwhelming occurrences; and we moved about beneath the leaden, darkening sky with that tragic directionless zeal which results from a combined sense of futility and necessity of action. Our care was gravely minute; every cottage was again entered, every hillside dugout again searched for bodies, every thorny foot of adjacent slope again scanned for dens and caves, but all without result. And yet, as I have said, vague new fears hovered menacingly over us; as if giant bat-winged gryphons squatted invisibly on the mountain-tops and leered with Abaddon-eyes that had looked on trans-cosmic gulfs. As the afternoon advanced, it became increasingly difficult to see; and we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over Tempest Mountain. This sound in such a locality naturally stirred us, though less than it would have done at night. As it was, we hoped desperately that the storm would last until well after dark; and with that hope turned from our aimless hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to gather a body of squatters as helpers in the investigation. Timid as they were, a few of the younger men were sufficiently inspired by our protective leadership to promise such help."}

He held a growing anger, along with a wish to prove his theories to these people in soem striking.

But we had stayed for work at the summer school. we were in Arkham when it hit the town with force. We were not licensed doctors, but we had our degrees. As the number of people grew, we were pushed into service. The situation was beyond control. People died for the funeral directors to handle.

This situation affected West, who thought of the irony. There were bodies, yet none for his persecuted research! We were. The and pressure made my friend think. But West 's enemies were worn out with duties. College had closed. Every doctor from the school was helping to fight the typhoid plague. Dr. Halsey had done in service.

West, young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements, had scant patience with good Dr. Halsey and his erudite colleagues; and nursed an increasing resentment, coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion.

And then had come the scourge, grinning and lethal, from the nightmare caverns of Tartarus. West and I had graduated about the time of its beginning, but had remained for additional work at the summer school, so that we were in Arkham when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town. Though not as yet licenced physicians, we now had our degrees, and were pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew. The situation was almost past management, and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle. Burials without embalming were made in rapid succession, and even the Christchurch Cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead. This circumstance was not without effect on West, who thought often of the irony of the situation\u2014so many fresh specimens, yet none for his persecuted researches! We were frightfully overworked, and the terrific mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidly. But West\u2019s gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties.

Dr. Halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service, applying his extreme skill with whole-hearted energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness. Before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero, though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion. West could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe, but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines. Taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations, he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university dissecting-room one night, and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution."}

The record of the marriage two years before, were removed from most copies of the church. [THING] records where they should have been. Charles Ward found both records with great difficulty. This was after he discovered the widow 's name change. That discovery made him aware of his own family connection. It also created a feverish interest in him. This interest ended in his madness. The birth entry was found in a very curious way. It was found through letters to the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves. He had taken a duplicate set of records when he left his church job at the start of the Revolution. Ward tried this source because he knew his great - great - grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter had been an Episcopalian. Shortly, after the bitrh of his daughter, seemed to welcome the event with a strong feeling. This was very different from his usual codl manner. Curwen decided to have his portrait painted. He had it painted by a very talented Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander. The painter was then living in Newport. Later became famous as an early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The portrait was said to have been painted on a [THING] panel in the library of [THING] in Olney Court. Hwoever, neither of two old diaries that mention it said what finally happened to it. During this time, the unpredictable scholar showed signs of being unusually distracted. He spent as much time as he could at his farm on the Pwatuxet Road. He seemed, it was said, to be in a state of hidden excitement or suspense. It was as if he expected some amazing thing. Was very close to a strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy seemed to have been very important. He took most of his books on that subject from his [THING] to the farm. His pretended interest in [THING] affairs did not decrease. He did not miss any chances to help leaders like Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West. They were trying to raise the cultural level of the [THING]. The [THING] 's support for the liberal arts was then much lower than the level of Newport. He helped Daniel Jenckes start his bookshop in 1763. After that, he was his best customer. He also gave help to the struggling Gazette. It appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespeare 's Head.\n###\nThe record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widow\u2019s change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great-grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter had been an Episcopalian. Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject. His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town, which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespear\u2019s Head."}

As the White Ship sailed quietly away form the terraces with temples of Zar, we saw the tall towers of a great city on the far horizon ahead. The bearded man said to me: \"This is Thalarion, the Ciyt of a Thousand Wonders. All those mysteries that man has tried. Failed to understand live there.\" I looked again, from closer. I saw the city was greater than any city I had known. Dreamed of before. The towers of its temples reached into the sky. No man colud see their tops. The grim, grey walls stretched far back beyond the horizon. Over them, one could see only a few roofs. They were strange and threatening, yet deocrated with rich carvings and tempting sculptures. I wanted very much to enter this city. It was both attractive and frightening. I asked the bearded man to put me ashore at the stone dock by the huge carved gate Akariel. But he gently said no. He said: \"Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have gone. None have come back. Only demons and mad things that are no longer men walk there. The streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have seen the idol Lathi. That idol rules over the city.\". The White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion. For many days we followed a bird flying south. Its shiny feathers were the color of the sky it came from. Then we came to a pleasant coast bright with flowers of every color. As far inland as we could see, lovely woods. Bright shelters lay in the midday sun. From hidden places came bursts of song and pieces of beautiful msuic. There was also soft laughter so lovely that I urged the rowers to go faster. I was eager to raech the place. The bearded man said nothing. He watched me as we neared the shore lined with lilies. Suddenly a wind blew from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods. It brought a smell that made me shake. The wind grew stronger. air filled with the deadly, grave-like smell of towns struck by plague. As we sailed wildly away from that cursed coast, the bearded man finally spoke. He said: \"This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained.\".\n###\nBut we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of Zar, for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore. As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar, we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and the bearded man said to me: \u201cThis is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom.\u201d And I looked again, at closer range, and saw that the city was greater than any city I had known or dreamed of before. Into the sky the spires of its temples reached, so that no man might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim, grey walls, over which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and ominous, yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures. I yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city, and besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate Akariel; but he gently denied my wish, saying: \u201cInto Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have passed but none returned. Therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city.\u201d So the White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion, and followed for many days a southward-flying bird, whose glossy plumage matched the sky out of which it had appeared. Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbours beneath a meridian sun. From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and snatches of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so delicious that I urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene. And the bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we approached the lily-lined shore. Suddenly a wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which I trembled. The wind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the lethal, charnel odour of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries. And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, saying: \u201cThis is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained.\u201d"}

He saw the Akrham party turn sharply away from the path. He told the crowd the men were clearly trying to reach a smaller peak. This peak gazed down on the path at a point far ahead of where the bushes were now bending. This ineded proved true. The party was seen to reach the smaller hill only a time after the invisible blasphemy had psased it. Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out. He said Armitage was adjusting the sprayer that Rice held. He said something must be about to happen. The crowd moved uneasily. They remembered tihs sprayer was supposed to make the unseen horror visible for a moment. Two or three men closed their eyes. But Curtis Whaetley grabbed back the telescope. He strained his vision to the limit. He saw that Rice, from the party's position above. Behind the entity, had an excellent chance. He could spread the powerful powder with effect. Those without the telescope saw only an instant's flash of grey cloud. The cloud was about the size of a fairly building. It was near the mountain top. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it. He dropped it with a sharp scream into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He stgagered. He would have fallen if two or three others had not caught and steadied him. All he could do was moan almost too softly to hear. He said, \"Bigger than a barn... All made of squirming ropes...\n###\nSpells might be all right\u2014but suppose they weren\u2019t? Voices began questioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden, and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind. In the end the three men from Arkham\u2014old, white-bearded Dr. Armitage, stocky, iron-grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr. Morgan\u2014ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction regarding its focussing and use, they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker re-passed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining. Curtis Whateley\u2014of the undecayed branch\u2014was holding the telescope when the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it. Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three men shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the party\u2019s point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect.

Talked with the laundry worker. Though the washing machine is mainly used in the basement, all the dirty clothes are talked about in weekly routines. The laundry worker knew a fair amount about their special qualities. Like the worker in distant Sudsbury, she strongly said not to try to mix the colors. She said they are touchy and unpredictable. They can suffer strange damage from the thoughtless soaps from Outside. The crawling bleach Nyarlathotep is its main part and sign. Their jealous stainign of the wonderful white sheets showed clearly they did not want Carter to keep them. It was doubtful how they would treat a load meant to clean them. Bring them back. No person had ever beaten the red sock before. It might be just as good if no one ever beat it later.

Though the washing machine is chiefly employed in the basement, all the soiled garments are mentioned in weekly rituals; and the laundress was reasonably versed in their peculiarities.

Their jealous staining of the marvellous white linens shewed clearly that they did not wish Carter to preserve them, and it was doubtful how they would regard a load whose object was to cleanse them and restore them. No man had ever conquered the red sock in the past, and it might be just as well if none ever conquered it in the future. Such rumours as were told about that onyx drum of the Great Cycle were not by any means reassuring."}

Today I refuse to form any definite deductions from them, and even their frightful effect on me was one of suggestion rather than of revelation. A terrible and abnormal conclave, I felt certain, was assembled below me; but for what shocking deliberations I could not tell.

I did not hear the familiar whisper of Akeley, but well knew that such a sound could never penetrate the solid flooring of my room.

This task has left a permanent feeling of boredom in the office clerk's mind. It made the morning feel one hour longer. The freshness of the morning was already gone. The clerk talked for a long time with his own tired reflection in the mirror. They agreed on several points. They both felt more efficient people would laugh at these points. He admitted there was a terrible empty feeling in the kitchen. This feeling was directly connected to a household routine. This routine was even older than the forgotten breakfast. This connection could not be doubted. At least two food items that can spoil were definitely stale or soft. One other item he did not dare to think about was also in this state. This staleness likely started as early as the previous Thursday or even before. This was almost certainly true, even considering all known food preservation laws. What these horrible foods and the bread were doing seemed clear. Their appearance showed it. Every piece of visaul and smell evidence from the icebox showed it. They were defying all containers from every age. This includes the world's most airitght and flexible plastic containers. They hoped to escape frmo their cold tombs. They wanted to get back some small amount of moisture and life. This moisture and life had once made them full and fresh.\n###\nAnd now swiftly followed that mundane ordeal which has left its indelible mark of tedium on the soul of the hapless office clerk, and has added an hour to the perceived duration of a morning whose freshness was even then far behind. The clerk had conferred at length with his own weary reflection, and had come to an agreement with it on several points which both felt the more efficient would ridicule. There was, he conceded, a terrible emptiness alive in the kitchen, whose direct connexion with a domestic ritual even older than the forgotten breakfast could not be doubted. That at least two perishable items\u2014and one other of which he dared not think\u2014were in absolute possession of a staleness or flaccidity which had commenced as early as the previous Thursday or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known preservative laws. What these horrible comestibles\u2014and the bread as well\u2014were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their appearance and from every bit of evidence both visual and olfactory which had filtered in upon the icebox. They were defying the containers of all the ages, including those of the world\u2019s most airtight and resilient polymers, in the hope of escaping from their chilled sepulchres some vestige of the moisture and vitality which had once plumped and informed them."}

When he lifted the - pointed ojbect on the table, he thought the pull toward the north grew a. But, it was overcome by the and desire. He carried the - object down to Elwood \u2019s room. He prepared himself against the crying sounds of the repairman that rose from the floor. Elwood was, thank goodness, and seemed to be moving. There was time for a talk before leaving for breakfast and school. Gilman told about his dreams and worries. His host was and agreed something should be done. He was shocked by his guest \u2019s, worn look. He noticed the, - looking others had mentioned during the week. But there was not he could say. He had not seen Gilman on any sleepwalking trip. Had no idea what the object could be. He had heard the French - Canadian who lived below Gilman talking to Mazurewicz one evening. They were telling each how tehy feared the coming of Walpurgis - Night, a days. They were sharing comments about the, man. Desrochers, the person under Gilman \u2019s room, had spoken of night footsteps both with shoes. He spoke of the light he saw one night when he crept up to look through Gilman \u2019s keyhole. He told Mazurewicz he had not dared to look after he saw that light through the cracks around the doro. There had been talking. As he strated to describe it, his voice dropped to a whisper to hear. Elwood could not imagine what started these people gossiping. He supposed their imaginations were stirred by Gilman \u2019s hours. Talking on one side. On the side, it was stirred by the nearness of the May - Eve. That That Gilman talked in his sleep was. the idae of the violet dream - light had spread from Desrochers \u2019 listening at keyholes. These people were to imagine they had seen any thing they had heard about. As for a plan \u2014 Gilman should move down to Elwood \u2019s room and avoid sleeping. Elwood would, if, wake him whenever he started to talk. Get up in his sleep.\n###\nAs he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a trifle stronger; but even so, it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urge. He took the spiky image down to Elwood\u2019s room, steeling himself against the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor. Elwood was in, thank heaven, and appeared to be stirring about. There was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and college, so Gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent dreams and fears. His host was very sympathetic, and agreed that something ought to be done. He was shocked by his guest\u2019s drawn, haggard aspect, and noticed the queer, abnormal-looking sunburn which others had remarked during the past week. There was not much, though, that he could say. He had not seen Gilman on any sleep-walking expedition, and had no idea what the curious image could be. He had, though, heard the French-Canadian who lodged just under Gilman talking to Mazurewicz one evening. They were telling each other how badly they dreaded the coming of Walpurgis-Night, now only a few days off; and were exchanging pitying comments about the poor, doomed young gentleman. Desrochers, the fellow under Gilman\u2019s room, had spoken of nocturnal footsteps both shod and unshod, and of the violet light he saw one night when he had stolen fearfully up to peer through Gilman\u2019s keyhole. He had not dared to peer, he told Mazurewicz, after he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the door. There had been soft talking, too\u2014and as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisper. Elwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures gossiping, but supposed their imaginations had been roused by Gilman\u2019s late hours and somnolent walking and talking on the one hand, and by the nearness of traditionally feared May-Eve on the other hand. That Gilman talked in his sleep was plain, and it was obviously from Desrochers\u2019 keyhole-listenings that the delusive notion of the violet dream-light had got abroad. These simple people were quick to imagine they had seen any odd thing they had heard about. As for a plan of action\u2014Gilman had better move down to Elwood\u2019s room and avoid sleeping alone. Elwood would, if awake, rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep."}

He dropped the bowl with a, bell - clang. His hands shot out to stop the act. In an instant, he moved up the floor around the table 's end. He pulled the knife from the woman 's claws. He sent it clattering over the edge of the triangular hole. In another instant,, the situation changed. Those claws locked around his throat. The wrinkled face was twisted with anger. He felt the chain of the crucifix pressing into his neck. In his danger, he wondered how the sight of the object itself would affect the creature. Her strength was. But as she ketp choking him, he reached itno his shirt. He pulled out the metal symbol, broke the chain, and freed it. At the sight of the device, the witch seemed hit with panic. Her grip loosened to give Gilman a chance to break. He pulled the steel - claws from his neck. He would have dragged the woman over the edge of the hole. But the claws gained strength and closed. This time he decided to respond in the way. His hands reacehd for the creature 's throat. Before she saw what he was doing, he had the chain of the crucifix wrapped aroudn her neck. A moment, he tightened it to stop her breath. During her struggle, he felt something bite his ankle. He saw that Brown Jenkin had come to help her. With one kick, he sent the thing over the edge of the hole. He heard it whimper. He did not know if he had killed the crone.

His efforts had been. What he had stopped the knife from doign to the victim 's chest, the fangs of the horror had done to a wrist. The bowl that was. on the floor stood beside the body.\n###\nA second later the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely, and he dropped the bowl with a resounding bell-like clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous deed. In an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the table and wrenched the knife from the old woman\u2019s claws; sending it clattering over the brink of the narrow triangular gulf. In another instant, however, matters were reversed; for those murderous claws had locked themselves tightly around his own throat, while the wrinkled face was twisted with insane fury. He felt the chain of the cheap crucifix grinding into his neck, and in his peril wondered how the sight of the object itself would affect the evil creature. Her strength was altogether superhuman, but as she continued her choking he reached feebly in his shirt and drew out the metal symbol, snapping the chain and pulling it free. At sight of the device the witch seemed struck with panic, and her grip relaxed long enough to give Gilman a chance to break it entirely. He pulled the steel-like claws from his neck, and would have dragged the beldame over the edge of the gulf had not the claws received a fresh access of strength and closed in again. This time he resolved to reply in kind, and his own hands reached out for the creature\u2019s throat. Before she saw what he was doing he had the chain of the crucifix twisted about her neck, and a moment later he had tightened it enough to cut off her breath. During her last struggle he felt something bite at his ankle, and saw that Brown Jenkin had come to her aid. With one savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard it whimper on some level far below. Whether he had killed the ancient crone he did not know, but he let her rest on the floor where she had fallen. Then, as he turned away, he saw on the table a sight which nearly snapped the last thread of his reason. Brown Jenkin, tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of daemoniac dexterity, had been busy while the witch was throttling him, and his efforts had been in vain. What he had prevented the knife from doing to the victim\u2019s chest, the yellow fangs of the furry blasphemy had done to a wrist\u2014and the bowl so lately on the floor stood full beside the small lifeless body."}

Sometimes it meregs completely with their substance. It might be actively hostile. Or it might be driven only by blind motives of self-survival. In any case, such a monster must be an oddity.

Sir Alfred Jermyn became a baronet before he turned four. However, his interests did not suit his title. At age twenty, he joined a group of music-hall performers. At thirty-six, he left his wife and child to travel with a traveling American circus. His death was very disgusting. In the show he traveled with, there was a huge male gorilla. Its color was lighter than most gorillas. It was a very tame animal and very popular with the performers. We were very fascinated by this gorilla. Often, we would look at each other for a long time through the bars between us. Eventually asked for and got permission to train the animal. Our success amazed both audiences and other performers. One morning in Chicago, the gorilla and we were practicing a very clever boxing match. The gorilla hit with more force than usual. This hurt the amatuer trainer's body and pride. After that, members of \"Teh Greatest Show on Earth\" do not like to talk about what happened. They did not expect to hear us let out a sharp, inhuman scream. They did not expect to see us grab our clumsy opponent with both hands. They did not expect to see us throw it to the cage floor. Bite its hairy throat fiercely.

At twenty he had joined a band of music-hall performers, and at thirty-six had deserted his wife and child to travel with an itinerant American circus. His end was very revolting. Among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average; a surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers. With this gorilla Alfred Jermyn was singularly fascinated, and on many occasions the two would eye each other for long periods through the intervening bars. Eventually Jermyn asked and obtained permission to train the animal, astonishing audiences and fellow-performers alike with his success. One morning in Chicago, as the gorilla and Alfred Jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match, the former delivered a blow of more than usual force, hurting both the body and dignity of the amateur trainer. Of what followed, members of \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth\u201d do not like to speak.

Then they noticed the strange smell and feeling of vibration were gone from the room. What had caused them? Curiously they realized the smell and vibration were only near Akeley. They were strongest where he sat. They were not present in other rooms. The person paused. They moved the flashlight around the dark study.

As I hesitated, striving to conjecture where Akeley might be, and why he had so suddenly discarded his necessary sick-room garments, I observed that the queer odour and sense of vibration were no longer in the room. What had been their cause? Curiously it occurred to me that I had noticed them only in Akeley\u2019s vicinity. They had been strongest where he sat, and wholly absent except in the room with him or just outside the doors of that room.

It droned, clamored, mocked, and called from the northeast.\n###\nThe tension of my vigil became oppressive, and a wild train of trivial impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind. I heard a clock strike somewhere\u2014not ours, for that was not a striking clock\u2014and my morbid fancy found in this a new starting-point for idle wanderings. Clocks\u2014time\u2014space\u2014infinity\u2014and then my fancy reverted to the local as I reflected that even now, beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere, Corona Borealis was rising in the northeast. Corona Borealis, which my friend had appeared to dread, and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether. All at once my feverishly sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the soft medley of drug-magnified sounds\u2014a low and damnably insistent whine from very far away; droning, clamouring, mocking, calling, from the northeast."}

The tied horses moved their feet and made luod sounds in growing fear. It was a very bad time. There was fear in the old and cursed house itself. There were four terrible groups of broken pieces. Two groups were from the house. Two groups were from the well. They were in the woodshed behind the house. In front, there was a beam of strange. Wrong-colored light from the slimy deep well. Ammi stopped driver without thinking. He forgot that he himself was not hurt after the cold touch of the colored vapor in the attic room. But maybe it was good that he did that. No one will ever know whta was out that night. The wrong thing from beyond had not hurt any person with a strong mind. But no one can say what it might have done at that final moment.

Ammi had restrained the driver on impulse, forgetting how uninjured he himself was after the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room, but perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did.

We knew it was useless to use imaginative arguments against a comfortable, orthodox person. But something in the scene that afternoon made us argue more than usual. The crumbling gravestones, the old trees. The century-old roofs of the witch-haunted town around us all stirred our spirit to defend our work. We soon took the argument into the enemy's own area. It was not hard to start a counter-attack. We knew that Joel Manton actually half-believed in many old superstitions. Sophisticated people had outgrown them. These were beliefs like dying persons appearing far away. Or old faces leaving impressions on windows they looked through all thier lives. We now insisted that believing these rural grandmothers' stories showed faith in ghostly substances on earth. These exist apart from and after their physical forms. It showed a capability to believe in phenomena beyond all normal ideas. If a dead man can send his visible image across the world. Through centuries, then it is not absurd to think deserted houses are full of strange, feeling things. Or that old graveyards are full of the terrible, bodiless intelligence of gneerations. Since spirit cannot be limited by the laws of matter to cause these manifestations, why is it wild to imagine psychically living dead things? Their shapes, or lack of shapes, must be completely and terribly \"unnamable\" to human viewers. We told our friend with some warmth that \"common sense\" on these subjects is just a stupid lack of imagination.\n###\nThough I well realised the futility of imaginative and metaphysical arguments against the complacency of an orthodox sun-dweller, something in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual contentiousness. The crumbling slate slabs, the patriarchal trees, and the centuried gambrel roofs of the witch-haunted old town that stretched around, all combined to rouse my spirit in defence of my work; and I was soon carrying my thrusts into the enemy\u2019s own country. It was not, indeed, difficult to begin a counter-attack, for I knew that Joel Manton actually half clung to many old-wives\u2019 superstitions which sophisticated people had long outgrown; beliefs in the appearance of dying persons at distant places, and in the impressions left by old faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives. To credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers, I now insisted, argued a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from and subsequent to their material counterparts. It argued a capability of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions; for if a dead man can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world, or down the stretch of the centuries, how can it be absurd to suppose that deserted houses are full of queer sentient things, or that old graveyards teem with the terrible, unbodied intelligence of generations? And since spirit, in order to cause all the manifestations attributed to it, cannot be limited by any of the laws of matter; why is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in shapes\u2014or absences of shapes\u2014which must for human spectators be utterly and appallingly \u201cunnamable\u201d? \u201cCommon sense\u201d in reflecting on these subjects, I assured my friend with some warmth, is merely a stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibility."}

This house had the poor-quality carvings. There must have been many sculptures of the same time elsewhere. This is true even considering the reduced energy. Hopes of a hard. Very sure proof of others existing came to them soon after. But this was the first and only set they found directly. They planned to look more later. But as the writer said, current conditions required a different immediate goal. There would haev been a limit, though. After all hope of long future living in the place dide among the Old Ones, there must have been a complete stop to wall decoration. The final blow, of course, was the coming of the great cold. This cold once controlled most of the earth. It has never left the unlucky poles.

That is why I continued to feel that Wilcox, somehow cognisant of the old data which my uncle had possessed, had been imposing on the veteran scientist. These responses from aesthetes told a disturbing tale. From February 28th to April 2nd a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things, the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor\u2019s delirium. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported scenes and half-sounds not unlike those which Wilcox had described; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last. One case, which the note describes with emphasis, was very sad. The subject, a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism, went violently insane on the date of young Wilcox\u2019s seizure, and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell. Had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the notes in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the professor\u2019s questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction.

The sea began to rise in a threatening way. Atfer we closed our hatches, we waited to see what would happen. We realized we must go underwater or the growing waves would flodo us. Both the air pressure and the electrical charge were dropping. We wanted to save our limited mechanical power. But in this situation, we had no other option. We did not go down very deep.

Closing our hatches, we awaited developments until we realised that we must either submerge or be swamped in the mounting waves.

We did not descend far, and when after several hours the sea was calmer, we decided to return to the surface.

On On August 15th I received a letter. It disturbed me. It made me wish Akeley could set his silence. Call for help from the law. There had been events on the night of the 12 - 13th. Bullets flew outsdie the farmhouse. In the morning, three of the twelve dogs were found shot. There were claw prints in the road. Among them were the prints of Walter Brown. Akeley had started to telephone to Brattleboro for dogs. But the phone line went before he could say. he went to Brattleboro in his car. He learned that linemen had found the telephone cable cut. This was at a point where it ran through the hills of Newfane. But he was to start with four dogs. He had cases of bullets for his - game repeating rifle. The letter was written at the post office in Brattleboro. It came through to me without delay. My attitude toward the matter was by this time changing from to. I was for Akeley in his, farmhouse.

What would have happened had the dogs not been there, he did not dare guess\u2014but he never went out now without at least two of his faithful and powerful pack. Other road experiences had occurred on August 5th and 6th; a shot grazing his car on one occasion, and the barking of the dogs telling of unholy woodland presences on the other. On August 15th I received a frantic letter which disturbed me greatly, and which made me wish Akeley could put aside his lonely reticence and call in the aid of the law. There had been frightful happenings on the night of the 12-13th, bullets flying outside the farmhouse, and three of the twelve great dogs being found shot dead in the morning. There were myriads of claw-prints in the road, with the human prints of Walter Brown among them. Akeley had started to telephone to Brattleboro for more dogs, but the wire had gone dead before he had a chance to say much. Later he went to Brattleboro in his car, and learned there that linemen had found the main telephone cable neatly cut at a point where it ran through the deserted hills north of Newfane. But he was about to start home with four fine new dogs, and several cases of ammunition for his big-game repeating rifle. The letter was written at the post office in Brattleboro, and came through to me without delay. My attitude toward the matter was by this time quickly slipping from a scientific to an alarmedly personal one. I was afraid for Akeley in his remote, lonely farmhouse, and half afraid for myself because of my now definite connexion with the strange hill problem. The thing was reaching out so. Would it suck me in and engulf me? In replying to his letter I urged him to seek help, and hinted that I might take action myself if he did not. I spoke of visiting Vermont in person in spite of his wishes, and of helping him explain the situation to the proper authorities."}

Push me through, I decided to take it wehn I awoke. night I swallowed the drug. I floated into the golden valley and the groves. This time, when I reached the wall, I saw the bronze gate was. A glow came from beyond. It lit the trees. The tops of the buried temples in a way. I drifted on, singing, expecting the glories of the land from whihc I would return. As gate opened. The magic of the drug. Dream pusehd me, I knew all sights. Glories were. In that realm there was no land or sea. There was the emptiness of and space. than I had daerd to hope, I dissolved into that infinity of crystal forgetfulness. The demon Life had called me from it for one and hour. When I drew near the nameless city I knew it was cursed. I was traveling in a and valley under the moon. I saw it sticking out above the sands. It was like parts of a corpse sticking out from a made grave. Fear spoke from the age - worn stones of this survivor of the flood. This was the - grandmother of the pyramid. An feeling pushed me. It told me to retreat from and secrets that no man should see. No man had dared to see them. Remote in the desert of Araby lies the nameless city. It is crumbling and. Its walls are hidden by the sands of ages. It must have been like this before the stones of Memphis were laid. It was like this while the bricks of Babylon were. No legend is to give it a name. No legend recalls that it was. But it is told of in whispers around campfires. Grandmothers mutter about it in the tents of sheiks. all the tirbes avoid it without knowing why.\n###\nI knew not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked. Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence I should never return. But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hoped to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour. When I drew nigh the nameless city I knew it was accursed. I was travelling in a parched and terrible valley under the moon, and afar I saw it protruding uncannily above the sands as parts of a corpse may protrude from an ill-made grave. Fear spoke from the age-worn stones of this hoary survivor of the deluge, this great-grandmother of the eldest pyramid; and a viewless aura repelled me and bade me retreat from antique and sinister secrets that no man should see, and no man else had ever dared to see. Remote in the desert of Araby lies the nameless city, crumbling and inarticulate, its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages. It must have been thus before the first stones of Memphis were laid, and while the bricks of Babylon were yet unbaked. There is no legend so old as to give it a name, or to recall that it was ever alive; but it is told of in whispers around campfires and muttered about by grandams in the tents of sheiks, so that all the tribes shun it without wholly knowing why."}

The charming, pretty village of Newfane was less than an hour away. It was our last connection to the world people can truly call their own. This is by means of conquest and full settlement. After that, we left behind all connection to immediate, solid, and time-worn things. We entered a strange, quiet, unreal world. The narrow, ribbon-like road went up and down and turned. It did so with an almost conscious and willful unpredictability. This was among the empty green peaks and partly deserted valleys. Except for the sound of car. The slight movement of the few lonely farms we passed nwo. Then, the only thing we heard was the bubbling, sneaky trickle of odd waters.

However, when they went inside the black arch, their first feeling was disappointment. The sculptured crypt was a perfect cube, about twenty feet on each side. It was littered, but there was no large recent object. They looked for another doorway but did not find one. Soon, Danforth saw a place where the floor debris had been moved. They turned their torches to full brightness. What they saw was simple and small. The observer is still hesitant to describe it because of what it meant. The debris had been roughly leveled. Several small objects lay scattered on it. In one corner, a lot of gasoline must have been spilled recently. The smell was strong even at that high altitude. This could only be a camp. It was a camp made by beings who were searching. Like them, these biengs had been stopped by the unexpectedly blocked path to the abyss.\n###\nAnd yet, when we did venture inside that black arch, our first impression was one of anticlimax. For amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured crypt\u2014a perfect cube with sides of about twenty feet\u2014there remained no recent object of instantly discernible size; so that we looked instinctively, though in vain, for a farther doorway. In another moment, however, Danforth\u2019s sharp vision had descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed; and we turned on both torches full strength. Though what we saw in that light was actually simple and trifling, I am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it implied. It was a rough levelling of the debris, upon which several small objects lay carelessly scattered, and at one corner of which a considerable amount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odour even at this extreme super-plateau altitude. In other words, it could not be other than a sort of camp\u2014a camp made by questing beings who like us had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked way to the abyss."}

But most stories and ideas are about a relatively recent race. This race had a strange and complex shape. It did not look like any life from known to science. It lived until only fifty million years before humans appeared. They say this was the greatest race of all. This is because it alone had mastered the secret of time. It learned everything that was ever known or would be known on Earth. It did this by using its sharper minds. These minds could send themselves into the past and future. They could cross gaps of millions of years. They could study the knowledge of every age. All legends about prophets come from this race's achievements.

It had learned all things that ever were known or ever would be known on the earth, through the power of its keener minds to project themselves into the past and future, even through gulfs of millions of years, and study the lore of every age.

Chrods, vibrations, and joyful harmonies echoed all aorund me. At the same time, my amazed eyes saw a huge and beautiful sight. Walls, columns, and beams made of living fire shone brightly around me. I seemed to float in the air. These fiery shapes reached up to a very high, arched ceiling of amazing beauty. Along with this grand palace view. Sometimes replacing it in a changing pattern, I saw wide fields. I SAW tall mountains and welcoming caves. Every lovely scene my hpapy EYES could imagine was there. Yet everything was made of a glowing, light, and changeable substance. This subsstance was both like spirti and like matter. AS I looked, I understood that my own mind controlled these wonderful changes. Each view that appeared was the one my changing mind most wanted to see. In tihs perfect place, I did not feel like a stranger. Every sight and sound was known to mme. It had been this way for countless ages before. It woudl be this way for countless ages to come.\n###\nThe sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me. Chords, vibrations, and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand; while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty. Walls, columns, and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where I seemed to float in air; extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendour. Blending with this display of palatial magnificence, or rather, supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation, were glimpses of wide plains and graceful valleys, high mountains and inviting grottoes; covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eye could conceive of, yet formed wholly of some glowing, ethereal, plastic entity, which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter. As I gazed, I perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses; for each vista which appeared to me, was the one my changing mind most wished to behold. Amidst this elysian realm I dwelt not as a stranger, for each sight and sound was familiar to me; just as it had been for uncounted aeons of eternity before, and would be for like eternities to come."}

No traveller has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirit as of the eye. I myself am curious about the sensation I derived from my one lone walk before Ammi told me his tale. When twilight came I had vaguely wished some clouds would gather, for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul. Do not ask me for my opinion. I do not know\u2014that is all. There was no one but Ammi to question; for Arkham people will not talk about the strange days, and all three professors who saw the a\u00ebrolite and its coloured globule are dead. There were other globules\u2014depend upon that. One must have fed itself and escaped, and probably there was another which was too late. No doubt it is still down the well\u2014I know there was something wrong with the sunlight I saw above that miasmal brink. The rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year, so perhaps there is a kind of growth or nourishment even now. But whatever daemon hatchling is there, it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread. Is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air? One of the current Arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move as they ought not to do at night. What it is, only God knows. In terms of matter I suppose the thing Ammi described would be called a gas, but this gas obeyed laws that are not of our cosmos. This was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories. This was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to measure. It was just a colour out of space\u2014a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes. I doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think his tale was all a freak of madness as the townfolk had forewarned."}

One morning, he went to the toaster. He put a slice of bread into the slot. He waited for it to finish. The toasting took a very long time. The man waited and was left feeling sad and confused. The bread had changed much like it did before. The slice took far too long to turn brown after he pushed the lever down. The kitchen became very hot. The finished toast did not look good to eat. The heating coils glowed dimly. Still, the appliance made a sound complaining the setting was too low. It did not work right at all. It claimed its parts were in very bad shape. Its rough humming had a quality that was vageuly upsetting.

He approached the electric device one dawn, guiding the bread slice within the confines of the slot and waiting patiently for its completion. The toasting was a long one, and the man emerged from the vigil in a very saddened and perplexed state. The bread\u2019s transformation had developed much like a prior attempt, save that the slice had been an excessively long time in darkening after the lever had been forced down and the kitchen had been filled with an imperative heat; and in the bearing of the altered bread there was no trace of wholesome nourishment. The coils had glowed dimly, yet even so the appliance had emitted a complaint that the setting was too low. It had not operated correctly at all, averring that its elements were in very poor condition; but in its hoarse humming there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it from his mind."}

Dancers and musicians mocked the memory of those beings and their older gods. They wore rose crowns from the gardens of Zokkar. The kings would look over the [THING]. Curse the bones of the dead beneath it. At first, the high priests did not like these festivals. Strange stories had come down to them. They told how the sea - green idol had disappeared. They told how Taran - Ish had died from fear and left a warning. They said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights under the [THING] waters. But as many years passed with no disaster, even the priests laughed and cursed. They joined the feasters ' wild parties. Indeed, had they not often performed the very old and secret ritual themselves? They performed it in their high tower to show hatred for Bokrug, the [THING] - lizard. A thousand years of wealth and pleasure passed over Sarnath. It was the wonder of the world and the pride of all [THING]. Gorgeous beyond imagination was the feast for the thousandth year of Ib 's destruction. For ten years it had been talked about in the land of Mnar. As it drew near, men came to Sarnath on horses, camels, and elephants. They came from Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron. They came from all the cities of Mnar and the lands beyond. On the chosen night, princes ' pavilions. Travellers ' tents were set up before the marble walls. The whole shore echoed with the song of happy party - goers. Inside his banquet hall lay Nargis - Hei, the king. He was drunk with ancient [THING] from the cellars of conquered Pnath. He was surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves. Many strange foods were eaten at that feast. There were peacocks from the islands of Nariel in the Middle Ocean. There were young goats from the far hills of Implan. There were camel heels from the Bnazic desert. There were nuts and spices from Cydathrian groves. There were pearls from wave - washed Mtal dissolved in Thraa vinegar. There were too mnay sauces to count. They were made by the cleverest cooks in all Mnar. They suited every feaster 's taste. But the most valued of all the foods were the great fish from the [THING]. Each was very large. They were served on golden plates set with rubies and diamonds. Whilst the king and his nobles feasted inside the palace. They looked at the final dish waiting on golden plates. Others feasted in other places.\n###\nGreat honours were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings, and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of Zokkar. And the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it. At first the high-priests liked not these festivals, for there had descended amongst them queer tales of how the sea-green eikon had vanished, and how Taran-Ish had died from fear and left a warning. And they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake. But as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters. Indeed, had they not themselves, in their high tower, often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of Bokrug, the water-lizard? And a thousand years of riches and delight passed over Sarnath, wonder of the world and pride of all mankind. Gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of Ib. For a decade had it been talked of in the land of Mnar, and as it drew nigh there came to Sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from Thraa, Ilarnek, and Kadatheron, and all the cities of Mnar and the lands beyond. Before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travellers, and all the shore resounded with the song of happy revellers. Within his banquet-hall reclined Nargis-Hei, the king, drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered Pnath, and surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves. There were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast; peacocks from the isles of Nariel in the Middle Ocean, young goats from the distant hills of Implan, heels of camels from the Bnazic desert, nuts and spices from Cydathrian groves, and pearls from wave-washed Mtal dissolved in the vinegar of Thraa. Of sauces there were an untold number, prepared by the subtlest cooks in all Mnar, and suited to the palate of every feaster. But most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from the lake, each of vast size, and served up on golden platters set with rubies and diamonds. Whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace, and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters, others feasted elsewhere."}

We saw large stone supports and pillars here and there. But what we saww seemed too weak for job. The raamp was very well preserved up to the current top of the tower. Thsi was very surprising given its exposure. ITS shelter had helped protect the strange and troubling space sculptures on the walsl.\n###\nBut the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which, eluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique Babylon. Only the rapidity of our flight, and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower\u2019s inner wall, had prevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the sub-glacial level. Pabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it in place, but Danforth and I could merely admire and marvel. We could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there, but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed. The thing was excellently preserved up to the present top of the tower\u2014a highly remarkable circumstance in view of its exposure\u2014and its shelter had done much to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls."}

It was what could make old brick slums. Crowds of dark, subtle faces into a thing of nightmare. It would not be the first time such feelings had to remain unexplained.

What could be told to ordinary people about the ancient magic. Grotesque wonders visible to sensitive eyes? These things were in the poisonous mix where all the bad leftovers of unhealthy ages combine their poison. Continue their vile terrors. A hellish green flame of secret wonder had been seen in this loud, slippery mess of outward greed. A gentle smile was allowed when all the known New-Yorkers mocked the police work experiment. They had been very witty and cynical. They laughed at the crazy search for unknowable mysteries. They assured one that in these days New York contained nothing but cheapness and vulgarity. One of them bet a large sum of money. He bet that a truly interesting stoyr about New York low life could not be written. This was despite many good works to on'es cerdit in the Dublin Review.

Around that unforgettable rodent army a whole separate cycle of myths revolves, for it scattered among the village homes and brought curses and horrors in its train. Such was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an elderly obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home. It must not be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environment. On the other hand, I was constantly praised and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me. When the task was done, over two years after its commencement, I viewed the great rooms, wainscotted walls, vaulted ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration. Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced, and the new parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations. The seat of my fathers was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the line which ended in me. I would reside here permanently, and prove that a de la Poer (for I had adopted again the original spelling of the name) need not be a fiend. My comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that, although Exham Priory was mediaevally fitted, its interior was in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alike.

We had often thought some truth must be behind parts of the legends that influenced our dreams. Still, we were not ready for a real physical thing from lost world beyond all imagination. The worst were photographs. In clear, undeniable reality, certain worn stone blocks stodo out against the sand. Their tops were slightly curved up and their bottoms slightly curved in. This shape told a clear story. When we looked with a magnifying glass, we could see too clearly. Among the damage and holes, there were traces of large curved patterns and sometimes symbols. Their meaning had become very horrible to us. But heer is the letter. It explains itself.\n###\nI was, for a time, almost stunned and incredulous; for although I had often thought that some basis of fact must underlie certain phases of the legends which had coloured my dreams, I was none the less unprepared for anything like a tangible survival from a lost world remote beyond all imagination. Most devastating of all were the photographs\u2014for here, in cold, incontrovertible realism, there stood out against a background of sand certain worn-down, water-ridged, storm-weathered blocks of stone whose slightly convex tops and slightly concave bottoms told their own story. And when I studied them with a magnifying glass I could see all too plainly, amidst the batterings and pittings, the traces of those vast curvilinear designs and occasional hieroglyphs whose significance had become so hideous to me. But here is the letter, which speaks for itself:"}

These insides might go down to the real ground level. This could happen if we entered buildings that still had roofs. Before we left the wall, we photographed it carefully. We studied its Cyclopean masonry. It had no mortar. We were completely puzzled. We wished Pabodie was there. His engineering knowledge might have helped us guess.

I became the most keen of explorers. A river had once flowed at the bottom of that valley. As I looked at the scene moer carefully, I saw the remains of stone. I saw terraces and bakns that were oncce green andd beautiful. In my excitement, I became almost as foolish and emotional as poor Klenze. I was very slow to notice that the southward current had finally stopped. This let the U-29 sink slowly down upon the drowned city. It settled like an airlpane landing on a town on the surface world. I was also slow to reaalize that the group of unusual dolphnis had disappeared.\n###\nConfronted at last with the Atlantis I had formerly deemed largely a myth, I was the most eager of explorers. At the bottom of that valley a river once had flowed; for as I examined the scene more closely I beheld the remains of stone and marble bridges and sea-walls, and terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful. In my enthusiasm I became nearly as idiotic and sentimental as poor Klenze, and was very tardy in noticing that the southward current had ceased at last, allowing the U-29 to settle slowly down upon the sunken city as an a\u00ebroplane settles upon a town of the upper earth. I was slow, too, in realising that the school of unusual dolphins had vanished."}

We remembered what Akeley had written to us about those earlier nights. We shuddered to think there would be no moon.

It is certain he received his rhetorical. Philosophical training in the schools of Athens. The extent of their spupression by Theodosius.\n###\nRome and Ravenna are rivals for the honour of his birth, though it is certain that he received his rhetorical and philosophical training in the schools of Athens\u2014the extent of whose suppression by Theodosius a century before is grossly exaggerated by the superficial. In 512, under the benign rule of the Ostrogoth Theodoric, we behold him as a teacher of rhetoric at Rome, and in 516 he held the consulship together with Pompilius Numantius Bombastes Marcellinus Deodamnatus. Upon the death of Theodoric in 526, Ibidus retired from public life to compose his celebrated work (whose pure Ciceronian style is as remarkable a case of classic atavism as is the verse of Claudius Claudianus, who flourished a century before Ibidus); but he was later recalled to scenes of pomp to act as court rhetorician for Theodatus, nephew of Theodoric. Upon the usurpation of Vitiges, Ibidus fell into disgrace and was for a time imprisoned; but the coming of the Byzantine-Roman army under Belisarius soon restored him to liberty and honours. Throughout the siege of Rome he served bravely in the army of the defenders, and afterward followed the eagles of Belisarius to Alba, Porto, and Centumcellae. After the Frankish siege of Milan, Ibidus was chosen to accompany the learned Bishop Datius to Greece, and resided with him at Corinth in the year 539. About 541 he removed to Constantinopolis, where he received every mark of imperial favour both from Justinianus and Justinus the Second. The Emperors Tiberius and Maurice did kindly honour to his old age, and contributed much to his immortality\u2014especially Maurice, whose delight it was to trace his ancestry to old Rome notwithstanding his birth at Arabiscus, in Cappadocia. It was Maurice who, in the poet\u2019s 101st year, secured the adoption of his work as a textbook in the schools of the empire, an honour which proved a fatal tax on the aged rhetorician\u2019s emotions, since he passed away peacefully at his home near the church of St. Sophia on the sixth day before the Kalends of September, A.D. 587, in the 102nd year of his age. His remains, notwithstanding the troubled state of Italy, were taken to Ravenna for interment; but being interred in the suburb of Classe, were exhumed and ridiculed by the Lombard Duke of Spoleto, who took his skull to King Autharis for use as a wassail-bowl. Ibid\u2019s skull was proudly handed down from king to king of the Lombard line."}

Instead of other, brighter rooms, there was only a limitless empty space of steady bright light. One might imagine this when looking down from the peak of Mount Everest upon a sea of sunliit fog. Behind me was a passage so tight I could not stand up in it.

He said he was a friend of the man I was going to visit. He had come down from Townshend in his place. Akeley, he said, had a sudden attack of some asthma problem. He did not feel well enough to travel outside. It was not serious, though. Tehre would be no change to the plans for my visit. I could not tell how much this Mr. Noyesknew about Akeley's work AND finds. Still, his casual way made him seem like a rellative outsider. Remeembering what a loner Akeley had been, I was a little surprised such a friend was. I did not let my confusion sotp me from getting into the car he pointed to. It was not thhe small old car i expected from Akeley's descriptions. It was a large and very clean new model\u2014apparently Noyes's own car. It had Massachusetts licence plates with that year's funny \"sacred codfish\" picture. I decided my guide must be someone who satys in the Toownshend area only for the summer.\n###\nAs I surveyed him I heard him explaining that he was a friend of my prospective host\u2019s who had come down from Townshend in his stead. Akeley, he declared, had suffered a sudden attack of some asthmatic trouble, and did not feel equal to making a trip in the outdoor air. It was not serious, however, and there was to be no change in plans regarding my visit. I could not make out just how much this Mr. Noyes\u2014as he announced himself\u2014knew of Akeley\u2019s researches and discoveries, though it seemed to me that his casual manner stamped him as a comparative outsider. Remembering what a hermit Akeley had been, I was a trifle surprised at the ready availability of such a friend; but did not let my puzzlement deter me from entering the motor to which he gestured me. It was not the small ancient car I had expected from Akeley\u2019s descriptions, but a large and immaculate specimen of recent pattern\u2014apparently Noyes\u2019s own, and bearing Massachusetts licence plates with the amusing \u201csacred codfish\u201d device of that year.

The shadows and golom let them see it sometimes. Near the early morning hours, the last pieces of food disappeared. They whispered about hunger and unhappiness. The cat's owner and tired spouse prayed to the plain, uncaring god of home life. They hoped the cat would handle not eating and sleep peacefully. They hoped the morning would bring food. Then morning came, gray and dusty through the blinds. The appliances made a worrying hum in swirls of pale electric light. At seven, a sad cry echoed through the rooms. Whiskers, thin and demanding, walked down from the high spot to the empty kitchen. It had a look of basic need in its eyes. It could not remember what it had imgained in the high bed of the still sleeping human. It could not say how it came down the carpet no other paws had walked. Nor could it explain these hungers at all, except to the Ancient Provider. The Ancient Provider later muttered odd things in his messy robe. He said the cerature that came down from that high spot was not entirely the creature that went up. He said somewhere in that ceramic food dish. In the hard-to-imagine depths of that sinister empty bag, the lost essence of what was called Feline Sustenance still remained.\n###\nAll night in the apartment they watched that silent bowl when the shadows and the gloom gave them glimpses of it, and when toward the small hours the last morsels vanished they whispered of hunger and discontent. And Whiskers\u2019 owner and weary spouse prayed to the bland indifferent god of domesticity, and hoped that the feline would endure its fast and slumber peacefully unless the dawn brought sustenance by morning. Then morning crept grey and dust-laden through the blinds, and the appliances hummed ominously in vortices of pale electric light. And at seven a plaintive cry echoed through the chambers as Whiskers, gaunt and insistent, padded down from the perch to the barren kitchen with the look of primal need in its eyes. It could not recall what it had envisioned in the high-placed bed of that still slumbering human, or say how it had descended that carpet untraversed by other paws. Nor could it express these hungers at all save with the Ancient Provider, who afterward muttered strange things in his disheveled robe; vowing that the creature who descended from that perch was not wholly the creature who ascended, and that somewhere within that ceramic food-dish, or amidst inconceivable depths of that sinister empty bag, there lingered still the vanished essence of that which was called Feline Sustenance."}

On Friday morning, Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by car for Dunwich. They arrived at the village about one in the afternoon. day was nice. Even in bright sunlight, a kind of quiet fear. Warning could be seen hanging over the strangely rounded hilsl. Deep, dark ravines of the affected area. Sometimes on a mountain top, a thin circle of stones could be seen against the sky. From the quiet fear at Osborn\u2019s store, it became clear something terrible had happened. The complete destruction of the Elmer Frye house and family was soon learned. Throughout that afternoon, the area around Dunwich was driven through. The local people were asked about all that had happened. With growing horror, one could see the sad Frye ruins. They had remaining signs of a sticky, tar-like substance. One could see the offensive tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle. The large areas of damaged plants in various places. The path up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Arimtage to have almost disaster-level importance. The evil, altar-like stone on the top was looked at for a long time.\n###\nFriday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich, arriving at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant, but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain-top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the air of hushed fright at Osborn\u2019s store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich; questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar-like stone on the summit."}

Much was expected from it. As a few stray bits beagn to vanish, I saw the eager interest on her face. I think she was ready to see proof of her growing belief. She believed cleanliness, order, and home harmony can exist without hand work. She believed a room has no central connecting spirit. It is just a collection of fibers and dust. Each part is more or less complete by itself. In one winning show, she was about to put the mystery of dirt into the category of myth. The machine now hummed more strongly. Under our eager eyes, it began to move across the carpet in a scary way. The nozzle moved in a disturbing way. The cord pulled tight. Various attachments shrank in a disgusting kind of twisting. Then the roaring thing threw out its dust in a cloud. This cloud was clearly one of despair. It was an intelligent despair that seemed enough to prove every theory of home science.

Temporary shapes that were even more horrible. As the entire illusion faded into a swirling, milky light, they started to look down towrad the ground again. They saw that the end of their journey was near. The unknown mountains ahead rose up very high like a scary wall of giants. Their odd, regular patterns were visible with surprising clarity even without binoculars. They were now flying oevr the lowest foothills. They could see two dark spots among the snow, ice. Bare areas of the main plateau. They believed these spots were Lake's camp and drilling site. The higher foothills rose up about five to six miles away. These formed a range that was almost separate from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan peaks beyond them. Finally, Ropesbegan to descend toward the left dark spot. Its size indicated it was the camp. As he did this, McTighe sent out the last uncensored wireless message the wolrd would ever receive from their expedition.\n###\nI was glad when the mirage began to break up, though in the process the various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted temporary forms of even vaster hideousness. As the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again, and saw that our journey\u2019s end was not far off. The unknown mountains ahead rose dizzyingly up like a fearsome rampart of giants, their curious regularities shewing with startling clearness even without a field-glass. We were over the lowest foothills now, and could see amidst the snow, ice, and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which we took to be Lake\u2019s camp and boring. The higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away, forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than Himalayan peaks beyond them.

The light was poor, but Birch could see well. He did not take Asaph Sawyer's coffin by mistake. The coffins looked similar. He had made a coffin for Matthew Fenner earlier. He did not use it because it was poorly made. He remembered Matthew Fenner was kind to him five years ago. So he made a better coffin for Matthew Fenner. He saved the rejected coffin. He used it when Asaph Sawyer died from a fever. Sawyer was not a likable man. People said he was extremely vengeful. He remembered every wrong, real or imagined. The researcher felt no guilt giving him the poorly made coffin. He now moved that coffin aside. He was looking for the Fenner coffin.\n###\nThe light was dim, but Birch\u2019s sight was good, and he did not get Asaph Sawyer\u2019s coffin by mistake, although it was very similar.

He gave old Matt the very best his skill could produce, but was thrifty enough to save the rejected specimen, and to use it when Asaph Sawyer died of a malignant fever. Sawyer was not a lovable man, and many stories were told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or fancied. To him Birch had felt no compunction in assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest for the Fenner casket."}

The sculptures showed signs of the cold 's spread. Vegetation was getting. The winter snows melted, in summer. The reptile livestock were. The mammals were not handling it. To continue the work of the world, it became needed to adjust some shapeless. - shoggoths for land life. The Old Ones had been to do this. The river was of life. The sea had lost of its creatures except for seals and whales. All the birds had flown, except for the, penguins. What happened next we could guess. How did the - cavern city? Was it, a stone body in darkness? Had the waters frozen? What fate came to the ocean - btotom cities of the world? Had any of the Old Ones moved of the spreading ice sheet? Existing geology shows no sign of them. Had the Mi - Go a threat in the land world of the north? Could one be of what might. Might not remain in the dark. dpeths of earth 's waters? Those things seemed to handle any amount of pressure. Men of the sea have caught objects at times. Does the killer - whale theory explain the. scars on seals seen a generation by Borchgrevingk? The specimens found by Lake were not part of these guesses. Their setting showde they lived at a time in the land city 's history. Based on their location, they were thirty million years. We thought that in their day, the - cavern city. The cavern itself, did not exist. They would recall an view. plants were. A land city with arts was around them. A river flowed along the mountains toward a - ocean., we could not stop thinking about these specimens. We thought about the eight ones missing from Lake 's destroyed camp.\n###\nBy this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognised, for the sculptures shewed many signs of the cold\u2019s malign encroachments. Vegetation was declining, and the terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer. The saurian livestock were nearly all dead, and the mammals were standing it none too well. To keep on with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously cold-resistant shoggoths to land life; a thing the Old Ones had formerly been reluctant to do. The great river was now lifeless, and the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales. All the birds had flown away, save only the great, grotesque penguins. What had happened afterward we could only guess. How long had the new sea-cavern city survived? Was it still down there, a stony corpse in eternal blackness? Had the subterranean waters frozen at last? To what fate had the ocean-bottom cities of the outer world been delivered? Had any of the Old Ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice-cap? Existing geology shews no trace of their presence. Had the frightful Mi-Go been still a menace in the outer land world of the north? Could one be sure of what might or might not linger even to this day in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth\u2019s deepest waters? Those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure\u2014and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at times. And has the killer-whale theory really explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by Borchgrevingk? The specimens found by poor Lake did not enter into these guesses, for their geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land city\u2019s history. They were, according to their location, certainly not less than thirty million years old; and we reflected that in their day the sea-cavern city, and indeed the cavern itself, had no existence. They would have remembered an older scene, with lush Tertiary vegetation everywhere, a younger land city of flourishing arts around them, and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a far-away tropic ocean. And yet we could not help thinking about these specimens\u2014especially about the eight perfect ones that were missing from Lake\u2019s hideously ravaged camp."}

I seemed to see a kind of glow in the water through the porthole facing the temple. This made me. I knew of no - sea organism that could produce light. But before I could investigate, impression came. Because it was, it made me doubt anything my senses might report. It was a hearing illusion. I felt a, sound like some yet song or hymn. It came from through the hull of the U-29. Convinced of my. abnormality, I lit some matches. Drank a dose of sodium bromide solution. This seemed to calm me to drive the illusion. But the phosphorescence remained. I had trouble stopping a urge to go to the porthole. Find its source. It was. I could make out objects around me by its light. I saw the sodium bromide glass. I had no memory of it being in that spot. This fact made me think. I crossed the room and touched the glass. It was where I had seemed to see it. I knew the light was either. Part of a hallucination. I could not hope to remove it. Giving up all resistance, I went up to the conning tower to look for the source of the light. Might it be another U - boat, offering a chance of rescue? The reader should accept nothing that follows as truth. Since the events go beyond law, they are the. creations of my mind. When I reached the conning tower, I found the sea in than I expected. There was no animal or plant phosphorescence. city that sloped down to the river was in the blackness. What I did see was not,, or. it took my bit of trust in my awareness. Windows of the temple cut from the rocky hill were glowing with a flickering light. It was as if from a flame.\n###\nNext there came to me the impression of light amidst the darkness of dead batteries, and I seemed to see a sort of phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened toward the temple. This aroused my curiosity, for I knew of no deep-sea organism capable of emitting such luminosity. But before I could investigate there came a third impression which because of its irrationality caused me to doubt the objectivity of anything my senses might record. It was an aural delusion; a sensation of rhythmic, melodic sound as of some wild yet beautiful chant or choral hymn, coming from the outside through the absolutely sound-proof hull of the U-29. Convinced of my psychological and nervous abnormality, I lighted some matches and poured a stiff dose of sodium bromide solution, which seemed to calm me to the extent of dispelling the illusion of sound. But the phosphorescence remained, and I had difficulty in repressing a childish impulse to go to the porthole and seek its source. It was horribly realistic, and I could soon distinguish by its aid the familiar objects around me, as well as the empty sodium bromide glass of which I had had no former visual impression in its present location. The last circumstance made me ponder, and I crossed the room and touched the glass. It was indeed in the place where I had seemed to see it. Now I knew that the light was either real or part of an hallucination so fixed and consistent that I could not hope to dispel it, so abandoning all resistance I ascended to the conning tower to look for the luminous agency. Might it not actually be another U-boat, offering possibilities of rescue? It is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective truth, for since the events transcend natural law, they are necessarily the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind. When I attained the conning tower I found the sea in general far less luminous than I had expected. There was no animal or vegetable phosphorescence about, and the city that sloped down to the river was invisible in blackness. What I did see was not spectacular, not grotesque or terrifying, yet it removed my last vestige of trust in my consciousness. For the door and windows of the undersea temple hewn from the rocky hill were vividly aglow with a flickering radiance, as from a mighty altar-flame far within."}

Thye went to see Charles at the hospital. They asked him as carefully as they could about Dr. Allen. They asked about the Prague visit. They asked what he had learned about Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. The man gave polite answers that did not commit to anything for all these questions. He only spoke in his rough whisper. He said he had found Dr. Allen had an amazing spiritual connection with some souls from the past. He said any contact the bearded man might have in Prague would likely have the same special ability. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realized to their annoyance that thye had actually been the ones being questioned. The confined man had skillfully gotten all the information from them. He did this without giving any important information himself. He learned everything the Prague letter had contained. Drs. Lyman did not think the letters of Ward's friend were very important. They knew that similar and obsessed people often group together. They believed that Charles or Allen had only found a similar person living abroad. Maybe this person had seen Orne's handwriting and copied it. He might be trying to act like he was the person reborn. Allen himself might be a similar case. He may have convinced the man to accept him as a living form of the long-dead Curwen. Such things had happened before. Using this practical thinking, the sensible doctors dismissed Willett's increasing worry about Charles Ward's current handwriting. Willett had studied it from unplanned samples gotten by various tricks. Willett thought he had finally identified its familiarity. He thought it vaguely looked like the handwriting of Joseph Curwen himself. But the otehr doctors saw this as just a copying pahse. They expected this in a madness of this type. They refused to see it as important either or Because of this ordinary attitude in his coworkers, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep a certain letter private. This letter arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April. It was from Rakus, Transylvania. Its handwriting was. Basically like the Hutchinson code that both the father. The doctor stopped in fear before opening it. It read as follows: Dear C.:\u2014I had a Squad of 20 Militia come to talk about what the Country Folk say. Must dig deeper and have less Hearde.\n###\nThe father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think, went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about Dr. Allen, about the Prague visit, and about what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in Prague would probably be similarly gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism; and that without imparting anything vital himself, the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the Prague letter had contained. Drs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young Ward\u2019s companion; for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart\u2014perhaps one who had seen Orne\u2019s handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone character\u2019s reincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead Curwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the hard-headed doctors disposed of Willett\u2019s growing disquiet about Charles Ward\u2019s present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus, Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal. This read as follows: Dear C.:\u2014Hadd a Squad of 20 Militia up to talk about what the Country Folk say. Must digg deeper and have less Hearde."}

The osberver was not surprised that his uncle was excited by sculptor's story. After learning what Legrasse had discovered about the cult, hearing about a sensitive young man would make anyone think. This young man had dreamed not only of the figure. Exact markings of the statue found in the swamp. The Greenland devil talbet. He had also dreamed at least three exact words from the chant used by both Esquimau devil-worshippers. Professor Angell's immediate decision to start a very thorough investigation was completely natural. However, observer privately suspected young Wilcox had heard about the cult indirectly. He thought the young man invented a series of dreams to make the mystery greater. To tirck his uncle. The professor's collection of dream stories and newspaper clippings was strong supporting evidence. The observer's rational thinking. The extreme nature of the whole subject made him choose what he thought were the most sensible conclusions. After studying the manuscript again carefully. Connecting the theosophy. Anthropology notes with Legrasse's cult story, the observer traveled to Providence. He went to see the sculptor. Give him the scolding he thought was right for tricking a learned old man.\n###\nThat my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor I did not wonder, for what thoughts must arise upon hearing, after a knowledge of what Legrasse had learned of the cult, of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the swamp-found image and the Greenland devil tablet, but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by Esquimau diabolists and mongrel Louisianans? Professor Angell\u2019s instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural; though privately I suspected young Wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way, and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle\u2019s expense. The dream-narratives and cuttings collected by the professor were, of course, strong corroboration; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what I thought the most sensible conclusions. So, after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of Legrasse, I made a trip to Providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke I thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man."}

About noon I encountered a suitable supply house far downtown, and at approximately 1:30 p.m. arrived at my boarding-place with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent mechanics. I had done all I could, and hoped I was in time. Black terror, however, had preceded me. The house was in utter turmoil, and above the chatter of awed voices I heard a man praying in a deep basso. Fiendish things were in the air, and lodgers told over the beads of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the doctor\u2019s closed door. The lounger I had hired, it seems, had fled screaming and mad-eyed not long after his second delivery of ice; perhaps as a result of excessive curiosity. He could not, of course, have locked the door behind him; yet it was now fastened, presumably from the inside. There was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow, thick dripping. Briefly consulting with Mrs. Herrero and the workmen despite a fear that gnawed my inmost soul, I advised the breaking down of the door; but the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some wire device. We had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms on that hall, and flung all the windows to the very top. Now, noses protected by handkerchiefs, we tremblingly invaded the accursed south room which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoon. A kind of dark, slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall door, and thence to the desk, where a terrible little pool had accumulated. Something was scrawled there in pencil in an awful, blind hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws that traced the hurried last words. Then the trail led to the couch and ended unutterably. What was, or had been, on the couch I cannot and dare not say here. But this is what I shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before I drew a match and burned it to a crisp; what I puzzled out in terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police station."}

Foreigners and believing.\n###\nCareful sifting of debris also disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the collapse, as well as older rat-bones gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and then highly productive of controversy and reflection. Other objects found included the mingled fragments of many books and papers, together with a yellowish dust left from the total disintegration of still older books and papers. All, without exception, appeared to deal with black magic in its most advanced and horrible forms; and the evidently recent date of certain items is still a mystery as unsolved as that of the modern human bones. An even greater mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed, archaic writing found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest age differences of at least 150 to 200 years. To some, though, the greatest mystery of all is the variety of utterly inexplicable objects\u2014objects whose shapes, materials, types of workmanship, and purposes baffle all conjecture\u2014found scattered amidst the wreckage in evidently diverse states of injury. One of these things\u2014which excited several Miskatonic professors profoundly\u2014is a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which Gilman gave to the college museum, save that it is larger, wrought of some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal, and possessed of a singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphics. Archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous brownish stains when found. Foreigners and credulous grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by Joe Mazurewicz as that which he had given poor Gilman many years before. Some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by rats, while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner of Gilman\u2019s old room all the time. Still others, including Joe himself, have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credence. When the slanting wall of Gilman\u2019s room was torn out, the once sealed triangular space between that partition and the house\u2019s north wall was found to contain much less structural debris, even in proportion to its size, than the room itself; though it had a ghastly layer of older materials which paralysed the wreckers with horror. In brief, the floor was a veritable ossuary of the bones of small children\u2014some fairly modern, but others extending back in infinite gradations to a period so remote that crumbling was almost complete."}

Somewhat to our surprise, we saw the land was not very difficult for such terrain. Despite the crevasses. Other bad spots, it probably would not have stopped the sledges of a Scott, a Shackleton. Some glaciers seemed to lead up to wind-cleared passes with unusual smoothness. When we reached our chosen pass, we found it was no exception. Our feelings of tense expectation as we got ready to go around the top. Look out over an untouched world are hard to describe on paper. We had no reason to think areas beyond the range were very different from tohse already seen. The touch of evil mystery in these barrier mountains was a very subtle. It could not be explained in simple words. The same was true for the inviting sea of milky sky seen between their peaks. Rather was it a matter of vague psychological symbols and artistic connections. It was a thing mixed with unusual poetry. With old myths hidden in avoided. Even the sound of the wind held a strange sense of conscious evil. For a moment, it seemed the combined sound included a weird musical whistling. Piping over a wide range. Tihs happened as the wind blew in. Out of ever-present. Echoing cave openings. This sound had a cloudy note of remembered disgust. It was as complex and hard to place as any of the other dark feelings. We were now, after a slow climb, at a height of 23,570 feet according to the altimeter. We had definitely left the area of sticking snow below us. Up here were only dark, bare rock slopes and the start of rough-ribbed glaciers. But there were also those provoking cubes, walls, and echoing cave openings. They added a sign of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the dream-like. Looking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one mentioned by poor Lake. It had a wall exactly on top. It seemed half-lost in a strange Antarctic haze. Such a haze might have been responsible for Lake's early idea of volcanoes. The pass appeared directly before us. It was smooth and wind-swept between its sharp and evilly frowning towers. Beyond it was a sky filled with swirling clodus. Lit by the low ploar sun. It was the sky of that mysterious farther place which we felt no human eye had ever seen.\n###\nSomewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a Scott, a Shackleton, or an Amundsen. Some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to wind-bared passes with unusual continuity, and upon reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exception. Our sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper; even though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from those already seen and traversed. The touch of evil mystery in these barrier mountains, and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits, was a highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal words. Rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic association\u2014a thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes. Even the wind\u2019s burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity; and for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cave-mouths. There was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressions. We were now, after a slow ascent, at a height of 23,570 feet according to the aneroid; and had left the region of clinging snow definitely below us. Up here were only dark, bare rock slopes and the start of rough-ribbed glaciers\u2014but with those provocative cubes, ramparts, and echoing cave-mouths to add a portent of the unnatural, the fantastic, and the dream-like. Looking along the line of high peaks, I thought I could see the one mentioned by poor Lake, with a rampart exactly on top. It seemed to be half-lost in a queer antarctic haze; such a haze, perhaps, as had been responsible for Lake\u2019s early notion of volcanism. The pass loomed directly before us, smooth and windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons. Beyond it was a sky fretted with swirling vapours and lighted by the low polar sun\u2014the sky of that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed."}

The shining columns of that large hall where Musides HAD dreamed. Worked no longer rose amogn the olive trees. Lone and shaken people mounred the simple courtyards and the lower walls. The heavy hagning branch of the strange new tree had fallen directly on the luxurious main columned area. It turned the grand marble structure into a pile of ugly runis wiht odd thhoroughness. Strangers and Tegeans stood shocked. They looked from the wreckage to the large, threatening tree. Its appearance was weirdly like a human. Its roots reached in a odd way into the carved tomb of Kalos. Their fear and distress grew when they searched the fallen room. They could find no sign of the gentle Musides. The wonderfully made statue of Tych\u00e9. Only chaos lived in Amidst suuch enormous ruin. The representatives of two cities left disappointed. Syracusans were sad they had no sattue to carry home.

Slaves\u2019 cries ascended from a scene of desolation, and no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that vast hall wherein Musides had dreamed and toiled. Lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls, for upon the sumptuous greater peristyle had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree, reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins. Strangers and Tegeans stood aghast, looking from the wreckage to the great, sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of Kalos. And their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment; for of the gentle Musides, and of the marvellously fashioned image of Tych\u00e9, no trace could be discovered. Amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt, and the representatives of two cities left disappointed; Syracusans that they had no statue to bear home, Tegeans that they had no artist to crown.

People say the color of the plants is not in the spring. They say animals leave prints in the winter snow. Snow seems on the heath as it is. Horses, the that are left in this motor age, grow in the valley. Hunters can not rely on their dogs near the patch of dust. They say the influences are,.

The mystery of these woods is of the spirit as of the eye.\n###\nI do not think I shall visit the Arkham country hereafter. Three of the men who had been with Ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight, but there were not any real ruins. Only the bricks of the chimney, the stones of the cellar, some mineral and metallic litter here and there, and the rim of that nefandous well. Save for Ammi\u2019s dead horse, which they towed away and buried, and the buggy which they shortly returned to him, everything that had ever been living had gone. Five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert remained, nor has anything ever grown there since. To this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields, and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in spite of the rural tales have named it \u201cthe blasted heath\u201d. The rural tales are queer. They might be even queerer if city men and college chemists could be interested enough to analyse the water from that disused well, or the grey dust that no wind seems ever to disperse. Botanists, too, ought to study the stunted flora on the borders of that spot, for they might shed light on the country notion that the blight is spreading\u2014little by little, perhaps an inch a year. People say the colour of the neighbouring herbage is not quite right in the spring, and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow. Snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere. Horses\u2014the few that are left in this motor age\u2014grow skittish in the silent valley; and hunters cannot depend on their dogs too near the splotch of greyish dust. They say the mental influences are very bad, too. Numbers went queer in the years after Nahum\u2019s taking, and always they lacked the power to get away. Then the stronger-minded folk all left the region, and only the foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads. They could not stay, though; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild, weird stores of whispered magic have given them. Their dreams at night, they protest, are very horrible in that grotesque country; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir a morbid fancy. No traveller has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines, and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirit as of the eye."}

It was not just an artist's personal view that was seen. It was pure chaos itsel,f shown with clear and direct reality. That was it! The man was not a fantasy or romantci artist at all. He did not even try to show the shifting, colorful short-lived things from dreams. Instead, he coldly and mockingly showed a fixed, mechanical, and well-established world of hororr.

One opened the left door and went into a small room with a low ceiling. The room was dimly lit by two dusty windows. It had very little and very simple furniture. It seemed to be a sitting room. It had a table, several chairs, and a large fireplace. An old clock ticekd on the mantel above the fireplace. There were very few Books and papers. In the dim light, one could not easily read the titles. What was interesting was the old-fashioned look of everything. Most houses in this area were rich in old things. Here everything was curiously old. In the whole room, one could not find a single item made clearly after the revolution. Had the furniture had been less plain, this place wolud have been perfect for a collector.\n###\nLeaning my cycle against the wall I opened the door at the left, and crossed into a small low-ceiled chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way. It appeared to be a kind of sitting-room, for it had a table and several chairs, and an immense fireplace above which ticked an antique clock on a mantel. Books and papers were very few, and in the prevailing gloom I could not readily discern the titles. What interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every visible detail. Most of the houses in this region I had found rich in relics of the past, but here the antiquity was curiously complete; for in all the room I could not discover a single article of definitely post-revolutionary date. Had the furnishings been less humble, the place would have been a collector\u2019s paradise."}

Around the base was an inscription in characters which neither St. John nor I could identify; and on the bottom, like a maker\u2019s seal, was graven a grotesque and formidable skull. Immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it; that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave.

Alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know, but we recognised it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred; the ghastly soul-symbol of the corpse-eating cult of inaccessible Leng, in Central Asia. All too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old Arab daemonologist; lineaments, he wrote, drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead. Seizing the green jade object, we gave a last glance at the bleached and cavern-eyed face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it. As we hastened from that abhorrent spot, the stolen amulet in St. John\u2019s pocket, we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the earth we had so lately rifled, as if seeking for some cursed and unholy nourishment. But the autumn moon shone weak and pale, and we could not be sure. So, too, as we sailed the next day away from Holland to our home, we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background. But the autumn wind moaned sad and wan, and we could not be sure. Less than a week after our return to England, strange things began to happen. We lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor-house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor. Now, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be frequent fumblings in the night, not only around the doors but around the windows also, upper as well as lower. Once we fancied that a large, opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it, and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off."}

He had known about the feraed clutter since his first week. His growing fear of disorder had made him ask strange questions of a bent old janitor in the dim hallway. He had always wondered why men shook when they talked about it. The old janitor had told him only five such huge piles were known to have survived the shocked orders of the managers. Supervisors agianst them. All of these were locked away with nervous care by custodians who had dared to start sorting the hated, paper-covered waste. Now, finally, he had not only found a reachable example. Had examined it himself from a ridiculously close position. It was in the corner office of the dirty area on the third floor. He had often seen strange shapes there before. He almost imagined the twisted old clerk grinned from within knots of messy hair as the big discovery happened. The large, leather-covered ledger with the brass corners had been. Clearly visible under an ancient layer of notes.

He had known of the dreaded clutter since his first week, when his dawning horror of the chaotic had led him to ask queer questions of a stooped old janitor in the dim-lit corridor; and he had always wondered why men shuddered when they spoke of it. The old janitor had told him that only five such monstrous accumulations were known to have survived the shocked edicts of the managers and supervisors against them and that all of these were locked away with frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a sorting of the hateful, paper-strewn detritus. But now, at last, he had not only found an accessible specimen but had surveyed it his own from a ludicrously proximate vantage. It was in the corner office of the squalid precincts of the third floor, where he had often glimpsed strange formations before, and he almost fancied the gnarled old clerk leered amidst tangles of unkempt hair as the great revelation was made. The bulky, leather-bound ledger with the brass corners had been so prominently visible beneath a primordial stratum of memoranda, and the surrounding chaos was so absurdly profound."}

The notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young Wilcox had had his strange visitations. My uncle, it seems, had quickly instituted a prodigiously far-flung body of inquiries amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence, asking for nightly reports of their dreams, and the dates of any notable visions for some time past. The reception of his request seems to have been varied; but he must, at the very least, have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary.

The grocery boy had prepared me for it, yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed. Puerile though the story was, old Zadok\u2019s insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow. Later I might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of historic allegory; just now I wished to put it out of my head. The hour had grown perilously late\u2014my watch said 7:15, and the Arkham bus left Town Square at eight\u2014so I tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible, meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where I had checked my valise and would find my bus. Though the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient roofs and decrepit chimneys an air of mystic loveliness and peace, I could not help glancing over my shoulder now and then. I would surely be very glad to get out of malodorous and fear-shadowed Innsmouth, and wished there were some other vehicle than the bus driven by that sinister-looking fellow Sargent. Yet I did not hurry too precipitately, for there were architectural details worth viewing at every silent corner; and I could easily, I calculated, cover the necessary distance in a half-hour. Studying the grocery youth\u2019s map and seeking a route I had not traversed before, I chose Marsh Street instead of State for my approach to Town Square. Near the corner of Fall Street I began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers, and when I finally reached the Square I saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the Gilman House. It seemed as if many bulging, watery, unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as I claimed my valise in the lobby, and I hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my fellow-passengers on the coach. The bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight, and an evil-looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver. Sargent threw out a mail-bag and a roll of newspapers, and entered the hotel; while the passengers\u2014the same men whom I had seen arriving in Newburyport that morning\u2014shambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint guttural words with a loafer in a language I could have sworn was not English."}

Art and decoration were still made, but they were less good. The Elderly Ones seemed to konw their art was getting worse. They often moved very good old carvings from their land city. They did this before Constantine the Great did a similar thing. An emperor in a similar time of delcine took the best art from Greece. He did this to make his new Byzantine capital more splendid than its people cuold make. moving of carved blocks was not more widespread. This was surely because the land city was not completely left at first. The total leaving did happen later. It must have happened before the polar Pleisotcene had progressed far. By that time, the Old Ones had maybe become happy with their worse art. Or they had stopped seeing the better quality of the older carvings. In any case, the very old ruins around us clearly had not lost all their carvings. All the best single statues, like other things that could be moved, had been taken.\n###\nArt and decoration were pursued, though of course with a certain decadence. The Old Ones seemed to realise this falling off themselves; and in many cases anticipated the policy of Constantine the Great by transplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their land city, just as the emperor, in a similar age of decline, stripped Greece and Asia of their finest art to give his new Byzantine capital greater splendours than its own people could create. That the transfer of sculptured blocks had not been more extensive, was doubtless owing to the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned. By the time total abandonment did occur\u2014and it surely must have occurred before the polar Pleistocene was far advanced\u2014the Old Ones had perhaps become satisfied with their decadent art\u2014or had ceased to recognise the superior merit of the older carvings. At any rate, the aeon-silent ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale sculptural denudation; though all the best separate statues, like other moveables, had been taken away."}

Another thing that worried me during my research was the number of cases. In these, a, - to - catch look at the nightmares was gievn to people without memory loss. These people were of mind or. they could be thought of as carriers for learning. gains. For a second, they would be filled with force. slide and a, fading memory of horrors. There had been three cases in the fifty years. One was fifteen years. Had something been feeling through time from some place in Nature? Were these cases, experiments of a kind. Origin beyond belief? were a of the thoughts of my times. These fancies were helped by myths my studies found. For I could not doubt that legends from times formed a striking. Awesome detailing of memory losses like mine. These legends were to the victims and doctors of memory loss cases. About the nature of the dreams., I fear to speak. They seemed to taste of madness. At times, I believed I was going. Was there a type of belief affecting those who had suffered memory losses?, the efforts of the mind to fill a blank with memories might cause wanderings. This,, was the belief of of the doctors who helped me search for cases. They shared my confusion at the likenesses found. Though an folklore theory seemed to me. They did not call the condition insanity. They classed it among disorders. My path in trying to track it down. Study it, of trying to dismiss. Forget it, they supported as according to the rules. I valued the advice of doctors who had studied me during my possession by the personality. My disturbances were not. They concerned the matters I have mentioned.\n###\nIn three instances there was specific mention of such an unknown machine as had been in my house before the second change. Another thing that cloudily worried me during my investigation was the somewhat greater frequency of cases where a brief, elusive glimpse of the typical nightmares was afforded to persons not visited with well-defined amnesia. These persons were largely of mediocre mind or less\u2014some so primitive that they could scarcely be thought of as vehicles for abnormal scholarship and preternatural mental acquisitions. For a second they would be fired with alien force\u2014then a backward lapse and a thin, swift-fading memory of un-human horrors. There had been at least three such cases during the past half century\u2014one only fifteen years before. Had something been groping blindly through time from some unsuspected abyss in Nature? Were these faint cases monstrous, sinister experiments of a kind and authorship utterly beyond sane belief? Such were a few of the formless speculations of my weaker hours\u2014fancies abetted by myths which my studies uncovered. For I could not doubt but that certain persistent legends of immemorial antiquity, apparently unknown to the victims and physicians connected with recent amnesia cases, formed a striking and awesome elaboration of memory lapses such as mine. Of the nature of the dreams and impressions which were growing so clamorous I still almost fear to speak. They seemed to savour of madness, and at times I believed I was indeed going mad. Was there a special type of delusion afflicting those who had suffered lapses of memory? Conceivably, the efforts of the subconscious mind to fill up a perplexing blank with pseudo-memories might give rise to strange imaginative vagaries. This, indeed (though an alternative folklore theory finally seemed to me more plausible), was the belief of many of the alienists who helped me in my search for parallel cases, and who shared my puzzlement at the exact resemblances sometimes discovered. They did not call the condition true insanity, but classed it rather among neurotic disorders. My course in trying to track it down and analyse it, instead of vainly seeking to dismiss or forget it, they heartily endorsed as correct according to the best psychological principles. I especially valued the advice of such physicians as had studied me during my possession by the other personality. My first disturbances were not visual at all, but concerned the more abstract matters which I have mentioned."}

Shining through a decorated iron grating was the moon. It shone down a stone passageway of steps. These steps went up from the found doorway. I had seen the moon before except in dreams. I had seen it in visions I did not dare call memories. Fancying that I had reached the top of castl,e I began to rush up the steps beyond the door. But the covering of the moon by a cloud made me trip. I felt my way in the dark. It was when I reached the grating. I tried it and found it. I did not open it for fear of falling from the height I had climbed. the moon came out. The demonic of all shocks is that of the and. Nothing I had experienced could compare in terror with what I saw. It could not compare with the wonders that sight suggested. The sight itself was as it was. It was this: of a view of treetops seen from a place, there stretched around me on a level through the grating nothing than ground. It was decorated and varied by marble slabs and columns. It was shaded by an stone church. Its spire shone in the moonlight., I opened the grating and stumbled out upon the gravel path. That path stretched in two directions. My mind was and. But it held the desire for light. Not the wonder which had happened could stop my path. I neither knew nor cared if my experience was madness, dreaming, or magic. I was to look on brightness and happiness at any cost. I did not konw who I was or what I was. I did not know what my surroundings might be. Though as I continued to stumble along, I became of a kind of hidden memory. This made my progress not by chance. I passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns. I wandered through the country. I followed the road. But I left it to walk across meadows. ruins showed the presence of a forgotten road.\n###\nAs I did so there came to me the purest ecstasy I have ever known; for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron, and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from the newly found doorway, was the radiant full moon, which I had never before seen save in dreams and in vague visions I dared not call memories. Fancying now that I had attained the very pinnacle of the castle, I commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door; but the sudden veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble, and I felt my way more slowly in the dark. It was still very dark when I reached the grating\u2014which I tried carefully and found unlocked, but which I did not open for fear of falling from the amazing height to which I had climbed. Then the moon came out. Most daemoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and grotesquely unbelievable. Nothing I had before undergone could compare in terror with what I now saw; with the bizarre marvels that sight implied. The sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying, for it was merely this: instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence, there stretched around me on a level through the grating nothing less than the solid ground, decked and diversified by marble slabs and columns, and overshadowed by an ancient stone church, whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight. Half unconscious, I opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions. My mind, stunned and chaotic as it was, still held the frantic craving for light; and not even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my course. I neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity, dreaming, or magic; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost. I knew not who I was or what I was, or what my surroundings might be; though as I continued to stumble along I became conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous. I passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns, and wandered through the open country; sometimes following the visible road, but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road."}

I believe the peak momennt hapepned when he had shown that rational lief could be brought back. He then looked ffor new challenges by trying to revive separate body parts. He had wild. New ideas aboutt the independent life force of organic cells. Nerve tissue cut off from natural body systems. He got some horrible early results. These were in the form of tissue that never died and was artificially fed. This tissue came from nearly hatched eggs of a terrible tropical reptile. He was very eager to answer two biology questions. First, could any levle of awareness and rational action happen without THE brain? Could it come from the spinal cord and different nerve centers? Second, could any kind of light, non-physical connection exist apart from the material cells? Colud it link surgically separated parts that were onec a single living being? All this research needed a huge amount of freshly killed human felsh. That was why Herbert West had joined the Great War.\n###\nDangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved. I think the climax came when he had proved his point that rational life can be restored, and had sought new worlds to conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached parts of bodies. He had wild and original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and nerve-tissue separated from natural physiological systems; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of never-dying, artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an indescribable tropical reptile. Two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle\u2014first, whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain, proceeding from the spinal cord and various nerve-centres; and second, whether any kind of ethereal, intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism. All this research work required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh\u2014and that was why Herbert West had entered the Great War."}

The thing, it was averred, was biologically impossible to start with; merely another of those crazy country mutterings which Cotton Mather had been gullible enough to dump into his chaotic Magnalia Christi Americana, and so poorly authenticated that even he had not ventured to name the locality where the horror occurred. And as to the way I amplified the bare jotting of the old mystic\u2014that was quite impossible, and characteristic of a flighty and notional scribbler! Mather had indeed told of the thing as being born, but nobody but a cheap sensationalist would think of having it grow up, look into people\u2019s windows at night, and be hidden in the attic of a house, in flesh and in spirit, till someone saw it at the window centuries later and couldn\u2019t describe what it was that turned his hair grey. All this was flagrant trashiness, and my friend Manton was not slow to insist on that fact. Then I told him what I had found in an old diary kept between 1706 and 1723, unearthed among family papers not a mile from where we were sitting; that, and the certain reality of the scars on my ancestor\u2019s chest and back which the diary described. I told him, too, of the fears of others in that region, and how they were whispered down for generations; and how no mythical madness came to the boy who in 1793 entered an abandoned house to examine certain traces suspected to be there. It had been an eldritch thing\u2014no wonder sensitive students shudder at the Puritan age in Massachusetts. So little is known of what went on beneath the surface\u2014so little, yet such a ghastly festering as it bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses. The witchcraft terror is a horrible ray of light on what was stewing in men\u2019s crushed brains, but even that is a trifle. There was no beauty; no freedom\u2014we can see that from the architectural and household remains, and the poisonous sermons of the cramped divines. And inside that rusted iron strait-jacket lurked gibbering hideousness, perversion, and diabolism. Here, truly, was the apotheosis of the unnamable. Cotton Mather, in that daemoniac sixth book which no one should read after dark, minced no words as he flung forth his anathema."}

His main living space was in large room next door. Its handy alcoves. Big attached bathroom let him hide all dressers. Obvious useful items. Dr. Mu\u00f1zo was clearly a man of good brith, culture, and good taste. The person before me was short but perfectly shaped. He wore somwehat formal clothes of perfect cut and fit. A refined face with a masterful. Not proud look was adorned by a short iron-grey full beard. An old-fashioned pince-nez shielded the full, dark eyse. It sat above hooked nose which gave a Moorish touch to a face otherwise mostly Celtiberian. Thick, well-trimmed hair showed regular barber visits. It was parted neatly above a high forehead. The whole appearance showed striking intelligence and superior background and breeding. Still, as I saw Dr. Mu\u00f1oz in that blast of cool air, I felt a dislike that nothing in his looks could explain. Onyl his somewhat pale skin. Cold touch could have provided a physical reason for this feeling. Even these things should have been excusable given the man's known illness. It might also have been the unusual cold that put me off. Such chill was abnormal on such a hot da.y The abnromal always causes dislike, distrust, and fear. But dislike was soon forgotten in admiration. The strange doctor's great skill became clear at once. This was despite the ice-cold and shaky look of his bloodless hands. He clearly understood my needs at glance. He treated them with a master's skill. Meanwhile, he reassured me in a finely controlled but oddly hollow and toneless voice. He said he was the bitterest sworn enemy of death. He had spent his fotrune. Lost all his friends in a lifetime of strange experiments. These were devoted to defeating and destroying death. A Something of the kind but obsessed fnaatic seemed to live in him. He talked on almost too much as he checked my chest. He mixed a suitable drink of drugs fetched from the smaller lab room. Evidently he found the company of a well-born man a rare treat in this dirty setting. Memories of better days moved him to unusual speech. His voice, if odd, was at least calming. I could not even tell that he breathed as the smooth sentences came out politely.\n###\nI now saw that the hall room above mine\u2014the \u201cleetle room\u201d of bottles and machines which Mrs. Herrero had mentioned\u2014was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusive utilitarian devices. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination. The figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned, and clad in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit. A high-bred face of masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short iron-grey full beard, and an old-fashioned pince-nez shielded the full, dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise dominantly Celtiberian. Thick, well-trimmed hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breeding. Nevertheless, as I saw Dr. Mu\u00f1oz in that blast of cool air, I felt a repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify. Only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have been excusable considering the man\u2019s known invalidism. It might, too, have been the singular cold that alienated me; for such chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day, and the abnormal always excites aversion, distrust, and fear. But repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician\u2019s extreme skill at once became manifest despite the ice-coldness and shakiness of his bloodless-looking hands. He clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master\u2019s deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation. Something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him, and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory room. Evidently he found the society of a well-born man a rare novelty in this dingy environment, and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over him. His voice, if queer, was at least soothing; and I could not even perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out."}

They are joined by agreement with the evil toad - things. Are famously unfriendly to our earthly cats. So that at this point a meeting would have been a somewhat serious matter. After short talk of leaders, the cats rose. Took tighter shape, crowding protectingly around Carter. Getting ready to take the great jump through space back to the housetops of our [THING]. The old [HTING] leader told Carter to let himself be carried along smoothly. Without fighting in the grouped lines of furry jumpers. Told him how to jump when the rest jumped. Land nicely when the rest landed. He also offered to put him donw in any spot he wanted. Carter chose [THING] of Dylath - Leen from where the black ship had started. For he wished to sail from there for Oriab. The carved top of Ngranek. Also to warn the [THING] of the [THING] to have no more trade with black ships, if indeed that trade could be carefully. Then, upno a sign, the cats all jumped nicely with their friend placed safely in their middle. In a black cave on a far unholy top of the [THING] - mountains still uselessly waited the moving disorder Nyarlathotep. The jump of the cats through space was very fast. Being surrounded by his friends, Carter did not see this time the great black shapeless things that hide. Struggle in the deep hole. Before he fully understood what had happened he was back in his known [THING] at the inn at Dylath - Leen. The quiet, friendly cats were pouring out of the [THING] in streams. The old leader from Ulthar was the last to leave. As Carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by rooster crow. When dawn came, Carter went downstairs. Learned that a week had passed since his capture. There was still nearly two weeks to wait for the ship going toward Oriab. During that time he said what he could against the black ships. Their terrible ways. Most of the [THING] [THING] believed him. Fond were the jewelers of great red stones that none would fully promise to stop trading with the wide - mouthed merchants. If any of evil ever happens to Dylath - Leen through such trade, it will not be his fault.\n###\nThey are leagued by treaty with the evil toad-things, and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats; so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter. After a brief consultation of generals, the cats rose and assumed a closer formation, crowding protectingly around Carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland. The old field-marshal advised Carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers, and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed. He also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired, and Carter decided on the city of Dylath-Leen whence the black galley had set out; for he wished to sail thence for Oriab and the carven crest of Ngranek, and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys, if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off. Then, upon a signal, the cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst; while in a black cave on a far unhallowed summit of the moon-mountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. The leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded by his companions, Carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss. Before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the inn at Dylath-Leen, and the stealthy, friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams. The old leader from Ulthar was the last to leave, and as Carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by cockcrow. When dawn came, Carter went downstairs and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving. There was still nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward Oriab, and during that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways. Most of the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the wide-mouthed merchants. If aught of evil ever befalls Dylath-Leen through such traffick, it will not be his fault."}

For a time I could not sleep in the silence of the tower. It was very The sky was clear. The moon was now very Would not rise until rather late. As I lay there, I thought of Denys Barry. What would happen to that swamp when day came. I felt a strong urge to run out into the night. I wanted to take Barry's car. Drive wildly to Ballylough, away from the threatened lands. But before my fear could turn into action, I fell asleep. In my dreams, I saw the city in the valley. It was and dead under a covering of shadow. I think it was the high-pitched piping that woke me. But that piping was not the first thing I noticed when I opened my eyes. I was lying with my back to the east window. That window overlooked the swamp whree the moon would rise. So I expected to see on the wall in front of me. But I did not expect to see what now appeared. did glow on the wall panels ahead. But it was not any from the moon. A bright and sharp beam of red streamed through the Gothic window. The whole room was bright with an intense and unnatural splendor. My first actions were for such a situation. But onyl in stories does a person do the dramatic and expected thing. Instead of looking out across the swamp toward the light's source, I kept my eyes away from the window in panic fear. I clumsily put on my clothes with some confused idea of escaping. I remember grabbing my gun and hat. But before it was over, I lost them both. I did not fire the gun or put on the hat. After a time, the red light's fascination overcame my fear. I crept to the east window and looked out. The maddening, constant piping whined and echoed through the castle and over all the villaeg. Over the swamp was a flood of flaring It was scarlet and evil. It poured from the ruin on the far island. I cannot describe how that ruin looked. I must have been crazy. It seemed to rise tall and not decayed. It was splendid and surrounded by columns. The flame-reflecting marble of its upper part pierced the sky like the top of a temple on a mountain peak.\n###\nI retired early and full of dread, and for a long time could not sleep in the uncanny silence of the tower. It was very dark, for although the sky was clear the moon was now well in the wane, and would not rise till the small hours. I thought as I lay there of Denys Barry, and of what would befall that bog when the day came, and found myself almost frantic with an impulse to rush out into the night, take Barry\u2019s car, and drive madly to Ballylough out of the menaced lands. But before my fears could crystallise into action I had fallen asleep, and gazed in dreams upon the city in the valley, cold and dead under a shroud of hideous shadow. Probably it was the shrill piping that awaked me, yet that piping was not what I noticed first when I opened my eyes. I was lying with my back to the east window overlooking the bog, where the waning moon would rise, and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite wall before me; but I had not looked for such a sight as now appeared. Light indeed glowed on the panels ahead, but it was not any light that the moon gives. Terrible and piercing was the shaft of ruddy refulgence that streamed through the Gothic window, and the whole chamber was brilliant with a splendour intense and unearthly. My immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation, but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing. Instead of looking out across the bog toward the source of the new light, I kept my eyes from the window in panic fear, and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of escape. I remember seizing my revolver and hat, but before it was over I had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other. After a time the fascination of the red radiance overcame my fright, and I crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening, incessant piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the village. Over the bog was a deluge of flaring light, scarlet and sinister, and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet. The aspect of that ruin I cannot describe\u2014I must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column-cinctured, the flame-reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain-top."}

They seemed to form large households based on comfortable use of space. As can be guessed from pictures of activities. Fun among housemates, friendly mental connection. When they furnished their homes, everything was put in the middle of the huge rooms. This left all the wall space open for decoration. Lighting, for the land dwellers, was done by a device that was probably electro-chemical. Both on land and underwater, odd tables, chairs, and beds like round fraems were used.

The general thought the zoogs would likely hold a grudge against him for ruining their war plans. Randolph Carter accepted this offer with thanks. He was grateful for the safety it provided. He also enjoyed the elegant company of cats. Surrounded by a cheerful. Playful group of cats, relaxed after tehir successful duty, Randolph Carter walked with honor through that magical, glowing wood of giant trees. He spoke about his search with the general and his grandson. Meanwhile, other cats in the group played wild games. Chased fallen leaves blown by the wind among the fungi. The cat sadi he had heard muhc about the unknown Kadath in the wasteland. But he did not know its location. As for the wonderful sunset city, he had not even heard of it. Yet he would happily pass any news to Carter if he learned more later. He gave the seeker some very useful passwords among the cats of dreamland. He especially recommended the seeker to the chief of the cats in Celepha\u00efs, where he was heading. That cat, already somewhat known to Carter, was a respected Maltese. He would be very influential in any dealings. Dawn arrived as they reached the correct edge of the wood. Carter said a sad goodbye to his friends. The sub-lieutenant he had met as a kitten wanted to follow him. But the general would not allow it. That strict leader insisted path of duty was with the tribe and the army. So Carter began his journey alone across the golden fields. These fields stretched mysteriously beside a river lined with willow trees. The cats returned into the wood. Well did the traveler know those garden lands that lie between the wood. Happily, he followed the singing river Oukranos that showed his path. The sun rose higher over gentle slopes of woods and grass. It brightened the colors of the thousands of flowers covering every hill and valley. A blessed mist covers all this area. This place holds a more sunlight than other places hold. It also holds a more of the summer's buzzing music of birds and bees. So peopel walk through it as through a fairy place. They feel a greater joy and wonder than tehy ever remember feeling later.\n###\nThe old cat general now offered Carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach, deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise. This offer he welcomed with gratitude; not only for the safety it afforded, but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats. So in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment, relaxed after the successful performance of its duty, Randolph Carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees, talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of the primeval floor. And the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown Kadath in the cold waste, but did not know where it was. As for the marvellous sunset city, he had not even heard of that, but would gladly relay to Carter anything he might later learn. He gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland, and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in Celepha\u00efs, whither he was bound. That old cat, already slightly known to Carter, was a dignified Maltese; and would prove highly influential in any transaction. It was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood, and Carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell. The young sub-lieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it, but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army. So Carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willow-fringed river, and the cats went back into the wood. Well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood and the Cerenerian Sea, and blithely did he follow the singing river Oukranos that marked his course. The sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn, and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dingle. A blessed haze lies upon all this region, wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold, and a little more of the summer\u2019s humming music of birds and bees; so that men walk through it as through a faery place, and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember."}

Less is known about Of Gerrit Martense's descendants than about him. They were all raised to hate English civilization. They were taught to avoid colonists who accepted it. Their life was very secluded. People said their isolation made them slow to speak and understand. In appearance, all had a inherited trait of different eye colors. One eye was usually bule and the other brown. Their social contacts became fewer and fewer. Finally, they began to marry the many servants around the estate. Many members of the family declined. They moved across the valley and mixed with the mixed-race population. This population later produced the poor squatters. The others stayed stubbornly in their family mansion.

The results of climbing it would be. Atal 's companion Barzai the Wise had been pulled screaming into the sky for climbing the peak of Hatheg - Kla. With Kadath, if it were fuond, things would be. This is. Earth 's gods may be outmatched by a human, they are protected by the Gods from. It is not to discuss these beings. At in the world 's history, the Gods placed their mark upon earth 's granite rock. was in times before the flood. This is guessed from a drawing in parts of the Pnakotic Manuscripts that are to read. The time was on Hatheg - Kla when Barzai the Wise tried to see earth 's gods dancing by moonlight. Atal said it would be to leave all gods except for prayers. Carter was disappointed by Atal 's discouraging advice. He was disappointed by the help found in the Pnakotic Manuscripts. The Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan. But he did not give up all hope., he asked the priest about that sunest city seen from the terrace. He thought he might find it without the gods ' help. But Atal could tell him nothing., Atal said the place belonged to his dream - world. It did not belong to the land of vision that people know. It might be on another planet. In that case, earth 's gods could not guide him if they wanted to. But this was not. The stopping of the dreams showed it was something the Great Ones wished to hide from him. Carter did a thing. He offered his host drinks of the moon - wine the zoogs had given him. The man became. Without his caution, Atal spoke of forbidden things. He told of a image travelers reported was carved into the rock of the mountain Ngranek. This mountain is on the island of Oriab in the Southern Sea. He hinted it may be a likeness the earth 's gods made of their faces. They made it in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain. He hiccuped that the features of that image are. One could recognize them. They are signs of the race of the gods.\n###\nIt was lucky that no man knew where Kadath towers, for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave. Atal\u2019s companion Barzai the Wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of Hatheg-Kla. With unknown Kadath, if ever found, matters would be much worse; for although earth\u2019s gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal, they are protected by the Other Gods from Outside, whom it is better not to discuss. At least twice in the world\u2019s history the Other Gods set their seal upon earth\u2019s primal granite; once in antediluvian times, as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the Pnakotic Manuscripts too ancient to be read, and once on Hatheg-Kla when Barzai the Wise tried to see earth\u2019s gods dancing by moonlight. So, Atal said, it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayers. Carter, though disappointed by Atal\u2019s discouraging advice and by the meagre help to be found in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan, did not wholly despair. First he questioned the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace, thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods\u2019 aid; but Atal could tell him nothing. Probably, Atal said, the place belonged to his especial dream-world and not to the general land of vision that many know; and conceivably it might be on another planet. In that case earth\u2019s gods could not guide him if they would. But this was not likely, since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the Great Ones wished to hide from him. Then Carter did a wicked thing, offering his guileless host so many draughts of the moon-wine which the zoogs had given him that the old man became irresponsibly talkative. Robbed of his reserve, poor Atal babbled freely of forbidden things; telling of a great image reported by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain Ngranek, on the isle of Oriab in the Southern Sea, and hinting that it may be a likeness which earth\u2019s gods once wrought of their own features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain. And he hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange, so that one might easily recognise them, and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the gods."}

We moved between flashing screens with mysterious symbols in bright colors. We passed under pop-up ads. From these sometimes came offers to buy things or whipsers of shocking news.

We entered the weather scientist's data archives. There I paused, feeling weak from so much bleak information. The scrolling tables. Column graphs, the plain isobars. Delicate pressure lines drawn on strict grids, the plastic keyboards. Monitors with flashing readouts, the mounted. Almost aware maps of lined satellite pictures, the pixel-based screens. Tiled windows with bright radar, the icons of shiny notification alerts on top of carved menus, the amazing circuits of the processing units. The moving text feeds running along every inch of the polished glass. All these joined to create a view. Its plainness was beyond normal reality. It was almost mythical even in the information age. It shone like a ghost undre that sterile office Ahead was the curved and decorated greatness of the server farm. On the right was the shape of the far, unreachable storm fronts.

Always ahead loomed those titan servers, mighty processors, and clustered and bulbous satellites for which the modern forecaster\u2019s apparatus is infamous; and at length we passed under a great digital gateway and emerged in the archives of the meteorologist\u2019s data.

There it shimmered like a phantom under that sterile office light, with the domed and fretted magnificence of the server farm ahead, and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable storm fronts on the right. And ever the cooling fans and the hard drives hummed, while the ozone of overheating components spread like a miasma over that incredible chamber. No other human presence was there, and I was glad it was so. Then we turned and navigated again the digital alley of clicks, for the core algorithms themselves no layman may comprehend; and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central prediction model, since it is said to house the archaic chaos of all the rumoured climate patterns, and to send out queer uncertainties to the curious."}

This was the worst horror at the camp, but other things were also confusing. The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the eight uninjured biological specimens, the three sledges. Certain ietms was beyond sane guess. The itesm included instruments, illustrated technical books, writing materials, flashlights. Fuel, heaters, spare tents, fur suits. Also strange were ink blots on some papers. Signs of odd fumbling. Testing around the planes. Other machines at the camp. The drill site. The dogs seemed to hate the oddly disordeerd machinery. Also, the food storage was upset. Some basic foods were gone. There was a strangely funny pile of opened tin cans. The cans were opened in unlikely ways and places. Many matches were scattered around, some whole, some broken, some used. This was another small mystery. Also, two or three tent cloths and fur suits were found lying around. They had strange cuts, maybe from clumsy attempts at unimaginable changes. The chronicler found these. The bad treatment of the human. The crazy burial of the damaged Archaean specimens, all fit this apparent mad disorder.

The disappearance of Gedney, the one dog, the eight uninjured biological specimens, the three sledges, and certain instruments, illustrated technical and scientific books, writing materials, electric torches and batteries, food and fuel, heating apparatus, spare tents, fur suits, and the like, was utterly beyond sane conjecture; as were likewise the spatter-fringed ink-blots on certain pieces of paper, and the evidences of curious alien fumbling and experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices both at the camp and at the boring. The dogs seemed to abhor this oddly disordered machinery. Then, too, there was the upsetting of the larder, the disappearance of certain staples, and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places. The profusion of scattered matches, intact, broken, or spent, formed another minor enigma; as did the two or three tent-cloths and fur suits which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations. The maltreatment of the human and canine bodies, and the crazy burial of the damaged Archaean specimens, were all of a piece with this apparent disintegrative madness. In view of just such an eventuality as the present one, we carefully photographed all the main evidences of insane disorder at the camp; and shall use the prints to buttress our pleas against the departure of the proposed Starkweather-Moore Expedition."}

Some of Blake 's notes show fear that the thing might walk. He seemed to think it was summoned. But he adds that the streetlights create a barrier it can not cross. He speaks of the Shining Trapezohedron. He calls it a window on all time and space. He traces its history from the days it was made on Yuggoth. This was befroe the Old Ones brought it to earth. The things of Antarctica treasured it and put it in its box. The serpent - men of Valusia saevd it from their ruins. The beings looked at it ages in Lemuria. It crossed lands and seas. It sank with Atlantis. a Minoan fisher caught it in his net. He sold it to - skinned merchants from the land of Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren - Ka built a temple with a hidden room around it. He did something that caused his name to be removed from all monuments and records. it slept in the ruins of that temple. The priests and the Pharaoh destroyed that temple. It slept until a digger 's shovel brought it out to curse people. in July, the newspapers add to Blake 's notes. But they do in a and way. the diary has made people notice their information. It seems a fear had been growing in Federal Hill since a stranger entered the feared church. The Italians wihspered about movements and noises in the steeple. They asked their priests to remove an entity that haunted their dreams. They said Something was watching at a door. It was watching to see if it was to come out. Press news items mentioned the superstitions. But they did not explain about the horror 's background. It was the reporters today are not history experts. When writing about these things in his diary, Blake shows a kind of regret. He talks about the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron. He talks of banishing what he had called by letting daylight into the sticking - out spire. But at the time, he shows the amount of his interest. He admits a desire to visit the tower. He wants to look into the secrets of the glowing stone. This desire fills his dreams.\n###\nThe being is spoken of as holding all knowledge, and demanding monstrous sacrifices. Some of Blake\u2019s entries shew fear lest the thing, which he seemed to regard as summoned, stalk abroad; though he adds that the street-lights form a bulwark which cannot be crossed. Of the Shining Trapezohedron he speaks often, calling it a window on all time and space, and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark Yuggoth, before ever the Old Ones brought it to earth. It was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of Antarctica, salvaged from their ruins by the serpent-men of Valusia, and peered at aeons later in Lemuria by the first human beings. It crossed strange lands and stranger seas, and sank with Atlantis before a Minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants from nighted Khem. The Pharaoh Nephren-Ka built around it a temple with a windowless crypt, and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records. Then it slept in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new Pharaoh destroyed, till the delver\u2019s spade once more brought it forth to curse mankind. Early in July the newspapers oddly supplement Blake\u2019s entries, though in so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention to their contribution. It appears that a new fear had been growing on Federal Hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded church. The Italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark windowless steeple, and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted their dreams. Something, they said, was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark enough to venture forth. Press items mentioned the long-standing local superstitions, but failed to shed much light on the earlier background of the horror. It was obvious that the young reporters of today are no antiquarians. In writing of these things in his diary, Blake expresses a curious kind of remorse, and talks of the duty of burying the Shining Trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire. At the same time, however, he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination, and admits a morbid longing\u2014pervading even his dreams\u2014to visit the accursed tower and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone."}

She liked to walk in the hills during thunderstorms. She tried to read the big, smelly books her father inherited. The books came from two centuries of Whateleys. They were falling apart from age and worms. It is noted that she never went to school. But she knew many pieces of old knowledge that Old Whateley taught her. The remote farmhouse was always feared. This was because Old Whateley had a reputation for black magic. Also, Mrs died a violent death that was never explained. Whateley happened when Lavinia was twelve years old.

Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his host\u2019s carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents\u2019 frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczy\u2019s castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant. That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background."}

They called it a thunder - devil and a bat. They called it a vulture and a walking tree. Think we were to assume it was a living thing to storms. Some stories suggested wings, we believed its dislike for spaces made land movement a idea. The thing not matching this view was the speed the creature must have had. It needed this speed to do all the acts blamed on it. When we came to know the settlers, we found them in wyas. animals they were. They were moving down the scale because of their family history. They feared outsiders but got used to us,. they helped a lot when we beat down all the thickets. We tore out all the walls of the mansion in our search for the hiding fear. When we asked them to help us find Bennett and Tobey they were. They wanted to help us. They knew these victims had gone out of the world, like their people. We were that numbers of them had been killed. This was like the animals had been wiped out. We waited for tragedies to happen. By the middle of October we were confused by our lack of progress. Owing to the nights, no demon attacks had taken place. The completeness of our searches of house. Country made us think the hiding fear was a force. We feaerd the weather would come and stop our explorations. Everyone agreed the demon was in winter. There was a kind of hurry. Desperation in our daylight search of the horror - visited village. The village was because of the settlers ' fears. The settler village had no name. It had stood in a but gap between two hills. These were called Cone Mountain and Maple Hill. It was to Maple Hill than to Cone Mountain. Some of the homes were dugouts on the side of the hill. it lay two miles of the base of Tempest Mountian. It was three miles from the oak - surrounded mansion.\n###\nIn the same breath they called it a snake and a giant, a thunder-devil and a bat, a vulture and a walking tree. We did, however, deem ourselves justified in assuming that it was a living organism highly susceptible to electrical storms; and although certain of the stories suggested wings, we believed that its aversion for open spaces made land locomotion a more probable theory. The only thing really incompatible with the latter view was the rapidity with which the creature must have travelled in order to perform all the deeds attributed to it. When we came to know the squatters better, we found them curiously likeable in many ways. Simple animals they were, gently descending the evolutionary scale because of their unfortunate ancestry and stultifying isolation. They feared outsiders, but slowly grew accustomed to us; finally helping vastly when we beat down all the thickets and tore out all the partitions of the mansion in our search for the lurking fear. When we asked them to help us find Bennett and Tobey they were truly distressed; for they wanted to help us, yet knew that these victims had gone as wholly out of the world as their own missing people. That great numbers of them had actually been killed and removed, just as the wild animals had long been exterminated, we were of course thoroughly convinced; and we waited apprehensively for further tragedies to occur. By the middle of October we were puzzled by our lack of progress. Owing to the clear nights no daemoniac aggressions had taken place, and the completeness of our vain searches of house and country almost drove us to regard the lurking fear as a non-material agency. We feared that the cold weather would come on and halt our explorations, for all agreed that the daemon was generally quiet in winter. Thus there was a kind of haste and desperation in our last daylight canvass of the horror-visited hamlet; a hamlet now deserted because of the squatters\u2019 fears. The ill-fated squatter hamlet had borne no name, but had long stood in a sheltered though treeless cleft between two elevations called respectively Cone Mountain and Maple Hill. It was closer to Maple Hill than to Cone Mountain, some of the crude abodes indeed being dugouts on the side of the former eminence. Geographically it lay about two miles northwest of the base of Tempest Mountain, and three miles from the oak-girt mansion."}

Thereupon Carter, seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley, offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars; to which proposal they eagerly assented.

The more I thought, the more my choice leaned toward one Artuhr Munroe. He was a dark, thin man about thirty-five years old. His education, taste, intelligence. Temperament all seemed to mark him as someone not tied to normal ideas. On an afternoon in early September Arthur Munroe he listened to my story. I saw from the start that he was both interested and understanding. When I finished, he analyzed and discussed the thing with great cleverness and judgment. His advice was also very practical. He recommended delaying operations at the Martense mansion. We could become stronger wiht more detailed historical and geographical information. On his suggestion, we searched the countryside for information about the terrible Martense famliy. We found a man who had a wonderfully clear family diary. We also talked at length with the mountain people who had not fled from the terror. Confusion to farther slopes. We arranged to do our final task last. This task was the complete and final examination of the mansion using its detailed history. Before that, we would do an equally complete. Final examination of places linked to the various tragedies in settler legends. The results of this examination were not very clear at first. But our list of them seemed to show a fairly important pattern. The number of reported horrors was greatest in areas either fairly near the avoided house. Connected to it by sections of the sickly overgrown forest. There were, it is true, exceptions. The horror that caught the world's attention happened in a treeless area. It was far from the mansion and from any connecting woods. About the nature. Appearacne of the hiding fear, nothing could be learned from the scared. In the same sentence, they called it a snake and a giant. They called it a thunder-devil and a bat. They called it a vulture and a walking tree. Think we were right to assume it was a living thing very sensitive to electrical storms. Some stories suggested wings, we believed its dislike for open spaces made land movement a more likely idea.\n###\nMy chief acquaintances at Lefferts Corners had been the affable reporters, of whom several still remained to collect final echoes of the tragedy. It was from these that I determined to choose a colleague, and the more I reflected the more my preference inclined toward one Arthur Munroe, a dark, lean man of about thirty-five, whose education, taste, intelligence, and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences. On an afternoon in early September Arthur Munroe listened to my story. I saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic, and when I had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgment. His advice, moreover, was eminently practical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the Martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data. On his initiative we combed the countryside for information regarding the terrible Martense family, and discovered a man who possessed a marvellously illuminating ancestral diary. We also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes, and arranged to precede our culminating task\u2014the exhaustive and definitive examination of the mansion in the light of its detailed history\u2014with an equally exhaustive and definitive examination of spots associated with the various tragedies of squatter legend. The results of this examination were not at first very enlightening, though our tabulation of them seemed to reveal a fairly significant trend; namely, that the number of reported horrors was by far the greatest in areas either comparatively near the avoided house or connected with it by stretches of the morbidly overnourished forest. There were, it is true, exceptions; indeed, the horror which had caught the world\u2019s ear had happened in a treeless space remote alike from the mansion and from any connecting woods. As to the nature and appearance of the lurking fear, nothing could be gained from the scared and witless shanty-dwellers. In the same breath they called it a snake and a giant, a thunder-devil and a bat, a vulture and a walking tree. We did, however, deem ourselves justified in assuming that it was a living organism highly susceptible to electrical storms; and although certain of the stories suggested wings, we believed that its aversion for open spaces made land locomotion a more probable theory."}

Only when one or the other of the bodies had died during the exchange was this restoration impossible. In such cases, of course, the exploring mind had\u2014like those of the death-escapers\u2014to live out an alien-bodied life in the future; or else the captive mind\u2014like the dying permanent exiles\u2014had to end its days in the form and past age of the Great Race. This fate was least horrible when the captive mind was also of the Great Race\u2014a not infrequent occurrence, since in all its periods that race was intensely concerned with its own future. The number of dying permanent exiles of the Great Race was very slight\u2014largely because of the tremendous penalties attached to displacements of future Great Race minds by the moribund. Through projection, arrangements were made to inflict these penalties on the offending minds in their new future bodies\u2014and sometimes forced re-exchanges were effected. Complex cases of the displacement of exploring or already captive minds by minds in various regions of the past had been known and carefully rectified. In every age since the discovery of mind-projection, a minute but well-recognised element of the population consisted of Great Race minds from past ages, sojourning for a longer or shorter while. When a captive mind of alien origin was returned to its own body in the future, it was purged by an intricate mechanical hypnosis of all it had learned in the Great Race\u2019s age\u2014this because of certain troublesome consequences inherent in the general carrying forward of knowledge in large quantities. The few existing instances of clear transmission had caused, and would cause at known future times, great disasters. And it was largely in consequence of two cases of the kind (said the old myths) that mankind had learned what it had concerning the Great Race. Of all things surviving physically and directly from that aeon-distant world, there remained only certain ruins of great stones in far places and under the sea, and parts of the text of the frightful Pnakotic Manuscripts. Thus the returning mind reached its own age with only the faintest and most fragmentary visions of what it had undergone since its seizure. All memories that could be eradicated were eradicated, so that in most cases only a dream-shadowed blank stretched back to the time of the first exchange."}

Three miles from the mansion surrounded by oaks. Between the village. The mansion, over two mlies on the vlilage side was open land. The plain was mostly flat except for some snake-like mounds.

At dusk, the southren gate is reached. A guard in red robes makes one stop. One must tell three unbelievable dreams. One must prove to be a dreamer worthy to walk up Thran's steep, mysterious streets. Stay in bazaars where goods from fancy ships are sold. Then entry is made into that incredible city. One goes through a wlal so the gate is a tunnel. After that, one is among curved, wavy paths. These paths wind and between towers that reach toward the sky. Lights are seen shining through windows with grates and balconies. The sound of lutes. Pipes is heard coming quietly from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled. The way is known. A careful descent is made down darker streets to the rvier. At an sea-tavern by the river, the captains. Sailors known from many other dreams are found. There, a ticket to Celepha\u00efs on a green ship is bought. A stop is made for the night. Serious words are spoken to the cat of that inn. The cat is seen blinking sleepily in front of a huge fireplace. It dreams of wars and forgotten gods.\n###\nDown through this verdant land Carter walked at evening, and saw twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of Thran. And just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate, and was stopped by a red-robed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief, and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up Thran\u2019s steep mysterious streets and linger in bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold. Then into that incredible city he walked; through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel, and thereafter amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the heavenward towers. Lights shone through grated and balconied windows, and the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled. Carter knew his way, and edged down through darker streets to the river, where at an old sea-tavern he found the captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams. There he bought his passage to Celepha\u00efs on a great green galleon, and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of that inn, who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of old wars and forgotten gods."}

It was to matter. Under the conditions, it could not have been noticed. You must remember that I was in a building. The building was adn. the walls were. I was surrounded by a - balanced staff of servants. Because of this, fear would have been. This was considering the place. What I remembered is this. I know my cat 's moods. He was and. This was unlike his nature. He moved from room to room. He was and. He sniffed at the walls. These walls were part of the Gothic structure. I know how this sounds. It is like the dog in a ghost story. That dog growls before its master sees the ghsot. Yet I can not leave it out. The day, a servant complained. He said all the cats in the house were. He came to me in my study. My study was a west room on the floor. It had groined arches and oak panels. It had a window. The window looked over the limestone cliff and the valley. As he spoke, I saw the form of Nigger - Man. He was creeping along the west wall. He was scratching at the panels. These panels covered the stone. I told the man there must be a smell. Or there was an emanation from the stonework. senses could not perceive it. But it affected the senses of cats. It affected them through the wood. I believed this. The fellow suggested mice or rats might be. I mentioned that there had been no rats for three hundred years. the field mice from the country were found. They were not found in these walls. They were known to stray. That afternoon, I called on Capt. Norrys. He assured me it would be. It would be for field mice to the priory. They would not come in such a and way. That night, I did not use a valet as. I went to bed in the west tower room. I had chosen this room as my. You reached it from the study. You used a stone staircase and a gallery. The staircase was. The gallery was restored. The room was and. It had no panesl on the walls. It was hung with tapestries. I had chosen these tapestries myself in London.\n###\nIt was so simple as to be almost negligible, and could not possibly have been noticed under the circumstances; for it must be recalled that since I was in a building practically fresh and new except for the walls, and surrounded by a well-balanced staff of servitors, apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality. What I afterward remembered is merely this\u2014that my old black cat, whose moods I know so well, was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an extent wholly out of keeping with his natural character. He roved from room to room, restless and disturbed, and sniffed constantly about the walls which formed part of the old Gothic structure. I realise how trite this sounds\u2014like the inevitable dog in the ghost story, which always growls before his master sees the sheeted figure\u2014yet I cannot consistently suppress it. The following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the cats in the house. He came to me in my study, a lofty west room on the second story, with groined arches, black oak panelling, and a triple Gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley; and even as he spoke I saw the jetty form of Nigger-Man creeping along the west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient stone. I told the man that there must be some singular odour or emanation from the old stonework, imperceptible to human senses, but affecting the delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork. This I truly believed, and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats, I mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years, and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be found in these high walls, where they had never been known to stray. That afternoon I called on Capt. Norrys, and he assured me that it would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden and unprecedented fashion. That night, dispensing as usual with a valet, I retired in the west tower chamber which I had chosen as my own, reached from the study by a stone staircase and short gallery\u2014the former partly ancient, the latter entirely restored. This room was circular, very high, and without wainscotting, being hung with arras which I had myself chosen in London."}

Its biazrre and unbelievable shapes impresssed us again from every new viewing angle. It was a mirage made of solid stone. If not for the photographs, I would still doubt such a thing could exist. The general style of stonework was the same as the wall we had looked at. But the exrteme shapes this stonework took in its city forms are beyond all description.\n###\nThe half-mile walk downhill to the actual city, with the upper wind shrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background, was something whose smallest details will always remain engraved on my mind. Only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but Danforth and me conceive such optical effects. Between us and the churning vapours of the west lay that monstrous tangle of dark stone towers; its outr\u00e9 and incredible forms impressing us afresh at every new angle of vision. It was a mirage in solid stone, and were it not for the photographs I would still doubt that such a thing could be. The general type of masonry was identical with that of the rampart we had examined; but the extravagant shapes which this masonry took in its urban manifestations were past all description."}

So I spent some of that evening at my wooden writing desk. I was going through the piled-up wsate of old mail. When I tried to arrange the envelopes on the desk, the side table, the bookshelves. The floor, I found them even more messy. Wrong than my first look had suggested. I understood I did not have the strength to face their first natuarl mess. They had kind of unclear evil. It was as if something not holy was wtih anyone too involved with such forgotten letters. At the record book, where I was making a list, the notes only made me not want to continue such a sad, low task. The papers in the drawers showed much the same old age. Clearly, to an orderly person, this mail was an extreme case of household rot.\n###\nAnd so I spent part of that evening at my oaken escritoire sorting through the accumulated detritus of old mail. When I had tried to organize the envelopes upon the desk, the side table, the bookshelves, and the floor, I had found them even more chaotic and profane than my initial glance had portended; and realised that I could not spare the fortitude to confront their first instinctive disorder. They had a kind of obscure malevolence, as if there were something unholy with anyone too much engaged with such forgotten correspondence. At the ledger, where I was cataloguing, the entries merely discouraged my proceeding with such a dismal, degenerate task; and the documents in the drawers shewed much the same antiquity. Clearly, in the eyes of the orderly, this mail was merely an exaggerated case of domestic decay."}

The young man warned him that many street signs were missing. He drew a rough but detailed map of the town's main features for the observer. After looking at it briefly, the observer felt sure it would be very helpful. He put it in his pocket and thanked him a lot. Despite the dirty look of the only restaurant he saw, the observer boguht a good amount of cheese crackers. He planned to eat them later for lunch. His plan was to walk the mian streets. He would talk to any outsiders he met. Then he would catch the eight o'clock cocah to Arkham. He could see the town was a clear and extreme case of communtiy decay. But he is not a sociologist. He would focus his serious observations on architecture only.\n###\nWarning me that many of the street signs were down, the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town\u2019s salient features. After a moment\u2019s study I felt sure that it would be of great help, and pocketed it with profuse thanks. Disliking the dinginess of the single restaurant I had seen, I bought a fair supply of cheese crackers and ginger wafers to serve as a lunch later on. My programme, I decided, would be to thread the principal streets, talk with any non-natives I might encounter, and catch the eight o\u2019clock coach for Arkham. The town, I could see, formed a significant and exaggerated example of communal decay; but being no sociologist I would limit my serious observations to the field of architecture."}

A very light scattering of unappealing cracks now showed on the surface. There were single liens and quiet groups of two or three. The lower parts of the falling aprat fabric sometmies held small areas with dirty stains. I saw a loose bit of fabric or two as I looked across it. The smell of old leather grew clearer and clearer. Soon I saw a quite deep dent ahead. It was next to a wide, stitched seam. Past that, a large, worn square opened up. As my fingers followed the seam, I felt along both sides. I saw some inner structures on the edge of the soft cushion. Partway down its slope. The material far below was very plentiful. I could make out two strong sets of stress marks up on my right. At least one down on my left. From this close distance, the smell was very strong. Then my inspection moved into the large half-circle dent across the middle panel. It stopped on the right side before a tall, button-topped bump. It had bits of dark polish. A partly faded symbol saying it was the maker's mark.\n###\nA very thin sprinkling of repellent-looking fissures now became visible on the surface\u2014lone creases, and silent knots of two or three. The lower planes of the crumbling upholstery sometimes harboured small patches with dingy discolorations, and I noticed a stray tuft or two as my gaze traversed its expanse. The scent of aged hide became more and more distinct, and presently I perceived a fairly deep depression ahead, bordered by a wide, stitch-hemmed seam beyond which a large, worn square opened out. As my fingers traced the seam I felt along both sides and observed some underlying structures on the edge of the yielding cushion or part way down its slope. The material far beneath was very abundant, and I could discern two vigorous sets of stress-marks upstream on my right and at least one downstream on my left. From this proximity the aroma was quite overwhelming.

It smelled and there were sounds of painful howling. The lapm was lowered. This was to avoid seeing the altar far away. It also avoided seeing the open pit with the pierced stone salb next to it. Most black doorways were found to lead only to rooms. Some rooms were Others were clearly used for storage. In several storage rooms, collections of different items colud be seen. One room was of rotting bundles of extra clothes. The clothes were covered in dust. It is observed that this clohting was clearly from one hundred and fifty years ago. In another room, many pieces of modern clothing were found. It seemed like supplies were being gathered slowly to outfit a group of men. However, the huge copper vats were disliked the most. These vats appeared sometimes. The sinister crusty material on them was also disliked. These were disliked even more than the strangely patterned laed bowls. The rims of those bowls held nasty deposits. smells stuck to these bowls. These smells were noticeable even over the general foul odor of the crypt. About half the circuit of the wall had been completed. Then another corridor was found. It was like the one from which entry had been made. Many doors opened from this corridor. Tihs corridor was investigated. Three medium-sized rooms were entered first. They contained nothing important. Finally, one came to a rectangular room. It had practical tanks and tables. It had furnaces and modern instruments. It had some books and many shelves wtih jars and bottles. This showed it was the laboratory of Charles Ward. It had been suoght for a time. It was also likely the laboratory of Josehp Curwen before him.\n###\nSo Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward\u2014and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him."}

The yak was tied to a stake in the ground. One notices the clouds glow more at this northern point. More than once it is thought that shapes are seen against them. On the third morning, the first onyx quarry comes into view. The men working there with picks and chisels are greeted. Before evening eleven quarries are passed. The land here is all onyx cliffs and boulders. There are no plants at all. Only rock pieces are scattered on a floor of black earth. The gray, impossible peaks always rise tall and threatening to the right. The third night is spent in a camp of quarry workers. Their flickering fires cast reflections on the polished cliffs to west. Many songs are sung and many stories are told. They show such knowledge of days and gods' habits. It becomes clear they hold many hidden memories of their ancestors, the Ones. He is asked where he goes. Caution is given not to go too far north. But it is replied that onyx cliffs are sought. No more risks than normal for prospectors will be taken. In the morning goodbye is said and the journey continues into the darkening north. Warning had been given that the feared, unvisited quarry would be found there. Hands older than human hands had pulled huge blocks from it. But it is not liked when turning back to wave a last goodbye. It is thought that approaching the camp is seen that hard-to-catch merchant with slanted eyes.

He observed the greater phosphorescence of the clouds at this northerly point, and more than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them. And on the third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry, and greeted the men who there laboured with picks and chisels. Before evening he had passed eleven quarries; the land being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders, with no vegetation at all, but only great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth, with the grey impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right. The third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west. And they sang many songs and told many tales, shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods that Carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the Great Ones. They asked him whither he went, and cautioned him not to go too far to the north; but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx, and would take no more risks than were common among prospectors. In the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north, where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than men\u2019s hands had wrenched prodigious blocks. But he did not like it when, turning back to wave a last farewell, he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes, whose conjectured traffick with Leng was the gossip of distant Dylath-Leen."}

The White Ship was seen sailing into the mist between the basalt pillars of West with music playing. The music stopped and the mist cleared. The Land of Cathuria was not seen. Instead, a fast, powerful sea was seen. The helpless ship was carried toward an unknown place. The distant sound of falling water was heard. Ahead on the far horizon, the huge spray of a giant waterfall was seen. There, the world's oceans drop into a deep nothingness. The bearded man was heard speaking with tears on his cheek. He said, \"The beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl has been rejected. It may neevr be seen again. The gods are greater than men. They have won.\" The eyes were closed before the crash that was known would come. The sight of the heavenly bird was blocked. It flapped its mocking blue wings over the edge of the waterfall.\n###\nSo to the sound of melody the White Ship sailed into the mist betwixt the basalt pillars of the West. And when the music ceased and the mist lifted, we beheld not the Land of Cathuria, but a swift-rushing resistless sea, over which our helpless barque was borne toward some unknown goal. Soon to our ears came the distant thunder of falling waters, and to our eyes appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract, wherein the oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness. Then did the bearded man say to me with tears on his cheek: \u201cWe have rejected the beautiful Land of Sona-Nyl, which we may never behold again. The gods are greater than men, and they have conquered.\u201d And I closed my eyes before the crash that I knew would come, shutting out the sight of the celestial bird which flapped its mocking blue wings over the brink of the torrent."}

What confused the observer was his complete lack of knowledge about what form the thing might take. No sane person had ever seen it. Few had ever clearly fetl it. It might be pure energy, a form outside the world of physical matter. Or it might be partly material, some unknown and unclear mass that can change shape. It could change to vague forms like solid, liquid, gas. A state with no particles. The human-like patch of mold on the floor, the shape of the yellowish vapor. The curve of tree roots in some old stories all suggest at least a distant memory of a human shape. No one could say with any certainty how close.

It repelled him horribly, and revolted all his inherited delicacy; but his determination to taste life to the full remained with him, and he maintained a bold front. But before his resolution was put to the test, the unexpected intervened. Old Bugs, springing up from the crouching position in which he had hitherto been, leaped at the youth and dashed from his hands the uplifted glass, almost simultaneously attacking the tray of bottles and glasses with his mop, and scattering the contents upon the floor in a confusion of odoriferous fluid and broken bottles and tumblers. Numbers of men, or things which had been men, dropped to the floor and began lapping at the puddles of spilled liquor, but most remained immovable, watching the unprecedented actions of the barroom drudge and derelict. Old Bugs straightened up before the astonished Trever, and in a mild and cultivated voice said, \u201cDo not do this thing. I was like you once, and I did it. Now I am like\u2014this.\u201d \u201cThis is the last time for you, old bird!\u201d he exclaimed furiously. \u201cWhen a gen\u2019l\u2019man wants tuh take a drink here, by God, he shall, without you interferin\u2019.

It poured from the strange ancient ruin on the far small island. I cannot describe how taht ruin looked. I must have been crazy. It seemed to rise tall and not decayed. It was splendid and surrounded by columns. The flame-reflecting marble of its upper part pierced the sky like the top of a temple on a mountain peka. Flutes shrieked and drums began to beat. As I watched with awe and terror, I thought I saw dark dancing shapes. They were outlined strangely against the vision of marble and bright light. The effect was huge and unthinkable. I might have stared forever. But the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger on my left. With a fear oddly mixed with great joy, I crossed the roudn room to the north window. From there I could see the village and the flat land at the swamp's edge. There my eyes widened again with wild wonder. It was as great as if I had not just turned from a scene beyond normal limits. On the ghostly red-lit plain, a line of beings was moving. They moved in a way no one ever saw before except in bad dreams. Gliding, half floating in the air, the white swamp-ghosts were slowly moving back. They went toward the still waters and the island ruin. Their formations were strange and suggested some ancient, serious ceremonial dance. Their waving see-through arms moved in a creepy rhythm. They were guided by the hateful piping of unseen flutes. They beckoned to a crowd of stumbling workers who followed like dogs. The workers had blind, mindless, clumsy steps. They seemed pulled by a strong demon-will. As the water spirits neared the swamp, a new line of staggering people came out. They came drunkenly from the castle from some door far below my window. They felt their way blindly across the courtyard and through part of the village. They joined the stumbling line of workers on the plain. Because they were far below me, I knew at once they were the servants brought from the north. I recognized the ugly, clumsy shape of the cook. His silliness had now become unbelievably tragic. The flutes piped horribly. Again I heard drums beating from the direction of the island ruin. Then silently and gracefully, the water spirits reached the water. They melted one by one into the ancient swamp. The line of followres never slowed. They splashed awkwardly after them and vanished. They vanished in a small whrilpool of unhealthy bubbles. I could barely see bubbles in the scarlet light.\n###\nOver the bog was a deluge of flaring light, scarlet and sinister, and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet. The aspect of that ruin I cannot describe\u2014I must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column-cinctured, the flame-reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain-top. Flutes shrieked and drums began to beat, and as I watched in awe and terror I thought I saw dark saltant forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and effulgence. The effect was titanic\u2014altogether unthinkable\u2014and I might have stared indefinitely had not the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger at my left. Trembling with a terror oddly mixed with ecstasy I crossed the circular room to the north window from which I could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog. There my eyes dilated again with a wild wonder as great as if I had not just turned from a scene beyond the pale of Nature, for on the ghastly red-litten plain was moving a procession of beings in such a manner as none ever saw before save in nightmares. Half gliding, half floating in the air, the white-clad bog-wraiths were slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial dance. Their waving translucent arms, guided by the detestable piping of those unseen flutes, beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of lurching labourers who followed dog-like with blind, brainless, floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless daemon-will. As the naiads neared the bog, without altering their course, a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window, groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village, and joined the floundering column of labourers on the plain. Despite their distance below me I at once knew they were the servants brought from the north, for I recognised the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook, whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic. The flutes piped horribly, and again I heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the island ruin. Then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one into the ancient bog; while the line of followers, never checking their speed, splashed awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which I could barely see in the scarlet light."}

He also wanted to visit the scattered farms and the unusual onyx villages of Inganok. He hired a yak and filled large leather saddle-bags for the trip. Past the Gate of the Caravans, the road went straight between farmed fields. There were many odd farmhouses with low domes. Great Ones stopped at smoe houses to ask questions.

He took part in shipping businesses. He bought dock space near Mile - End Cove. He helped rebuild the Gerat Bridge in 1713. In 1723, he was one of the [THING] who started the Congregational Church on the hill. He always kept the ordinary appearance of a [THING] not much over thirty. As the decades passed, this unusual trait started to attract wide attention. Curwen always explained it by saying he came from tough ancestors. Lived a simple life that did not wear him down. How such a simple life could match the mysterious arrivals. Departures of the secretive merchant. The strange glowign of his windows at all hours of the night, was not very clear to the townspeople. They tended to give other reasons for his continued youth and long life. Most [THING] thought Curwen 's constant mixing. Boiling of chemicals had a lot to do with his state. Gossip talked about the strange materials he brought from London. The Indies on his ships. Bought in Newport, Boston. When old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth. Opened his medicine shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn. Mortar, there was endless talk about the drugs, acids. Metals that quiet loner constantly bought. Ordered from him. Acting on the belief that Curwen had amazing. Secret medical skills, many [THING] with different illnesses asked him for help. He seemed to support their belief in a vague way. Awlays gave them strangely colored drinks in answer to their requests, it was noticed that his help to others rarely did any good. Finally, when over fifty years had passed since the stranger came. Without causing more than five years ' visible change in his [THING]. [THING], the [THING] began to whisper more darkly. They also accepted more than halfway his wish to be alone, which he had always shown. Diaries from that time also show many other reasons why Joseph Curwen was wondered at, feared. Finally avoided like a disease. His strong interest in graveyards, where he was seen at all hours. In all weather, was well known. No one had seen him do anything that could truly be called like a ghoul. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm. He usually lived there during the summer. [THING] would often see him riding there at various odd times of the day.\n###\nHe engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwen\u2019s incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the stranger\u2019s advent, and without producing more than five years\u2019 apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn. Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night."}

But if Willett and Mr. Ward did not show the letter to the psychiatrists, they sitll let it guide their own actions. No amount of clever argument could change the facts. The srtangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, whom Charles's frantic letter called a great threat, was in close. Sinister contact with two strange beings. Ward had visited these beings in his travels. They clearly claimed to be survivors or forms of Curwen's old Salem colleagues. Dr. Allen was regarded as the reincarnation of Joseph Curwen. Murderous plans were held. At least suggested, against a \"oby\" who was almost certainly Charles Ward. Organised horror was happening. No matter who started it, the missing Allen was now deeply involved. Therefore, grateful that Charles was saef in the hospital, Mr. Ward quickly hired detectives to learn all they could about the mysterious bearded doctor. They were to find where he came form, what Pawtuxet knew about him. If possible, his current location. The men were given a key to the bungalow that Charles provided. They were urged to search Allen's empty room, which was identified when the patient's belonigngs were packed. They were to get any clues from items he mgiht have left. The discussion with the detectives was held in his son's old library. A strong feeling of relief was felt when they finally left that place. A vague feeling of evil seemed to hang there. Perhaps it was because of what had been heard about the infamous old wizard whose picture once hung over the fireplace. Perhaps it was something else. But in any case, intangible bad atmosphere was partly sensed. It centered on that carved remnant of an oledr house. At times it almots felt like a physical presence.\n###\nBut if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charles\u2019s frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of Curwen\u2019s old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained\u2014or was at least advised to entertain\u2014murderous designs against a \u201cboy\u201d who could scarcely be other than Charles Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had started it, the missing Allen was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor; finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible discovering his current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which Charles yielded up, he urged them to explore Allen\u2019s vacant room which had been identified when the patient\u2019s belongings had been packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his son\u2019s old library, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation."}

When they finally entered the maze-like town, climbing over fallen stone. Feeling near the tall, crumbling walls, their feelings became intense. The observer was surprised thye kept so much self-control. Danforth was clearly nervous. He started making rude and unrelated guesses about the horror at the camp. The writer resented this more because he could not help sharing some conclusions forced by the features of this sick survival from nightmare times. The guesses also affected his mind. In one spot, where a ditry alley turned a corner, he said he saw faint marks on the ground he did not like. Elsewhere, he stopped to listen to faint, imagined sound from somewhere. He said it was a muffled musical piping, like wind in mountain caves. Somehow scarily different. The constant five-pointed shapes in the buildings. Wall patterns had a vaguely evil feeling they could not avoid. It gave them a subconscious surety about the beings that built. Lived in this unholy place.\n###\nWhen at last we plunged into the labyrinthine town itself, clambering over fallen masonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls, our sensations again became such that I marvel at the amount of self-control we retained. Danforth was frankly jumpy, and began making some offensively irrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp\u2014which I resented all the more because I could not help sharing certain conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare antiquity. The speculations worked on his imagination, too; for in one place\u2014where a debris-littered alley turned a sharp corner\u2014he insisted that he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like; whilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle imaginary sound from some undefined point\u2014a muffled musical piping, he said, not unlike that of the wind in the mountain caves yet somehow disturbingly different. The ceaseless five-pointedness of the surrounding architecture and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape; and gave us a touch of terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared and dwelt in this unhallowed place."}

That was the end of our voluntary searches in dream caves. Serious, our friend who had been beyond the barrier warned us we must never go into those places again. What he saw, he did not dare tell us. From his wisdo,m he said we must sleep as as possible, even if drugs were needed to stay awake. We soon learned he was right from the fear that filled us whenever we lost consciousness. After each and unavoidable sleep, we seemed older. Our friend aged very quickly, which was almost shocking. It is awful to see wrinkles fomr and hair turn white almost before your eyes. Our way of life was now completely changed. Hereotfore a recluse as far as we knewour friend now became frantic in his fear of being alone. At night he would not be by himself. The company of a few people would not calm him either. His only relief came from and wild parties. So we went to almost all gatherings of and lively people. Our appearance and age seemed to cause ridicule in most cases. We strongly disliked this. Our friend thought it was a smaller problem than being alone. Especially was he afraid to be outside alone when the stars were out. If forced into this situation, he would often look secretly at the sky as if chased by some monster there. He did not always look at the same place in the sky. It seemed to be a different place at different times. On spring evenings, it would be in the northeast. In summer, it wuold be almost overhead. In autumn, it would be in the northwest. In winter, it would be in the east, mostly in the early morning hours. Midwinter evenings seemed least scary to hmi. Only after two years did we link this fear to anything specific. Then we began to see he muts be looking at a special spot in the sky. Its position at different times matched the direction of his look. This spot was roughly marked by the constellation Cornoa Borealis.\n###\nThat was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream. Awed, shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again. What he had seen, he dared not tell me; but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible, even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake. That he was right, I soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed. After each short and inevitable sleep I seemed older, whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking. It is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair whiten almost before one\u2019s eyes. Our mode of life was now totally altered. Heretofore a recluse so far as I know\u2014his true name and origin never having passed his lips\u2014my friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude.

His sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort; so that few assemblies of the young and the gay were unknown to us. Our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which I keenly resented, but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude. Especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein.

In the summer it would be nearly overhead. In the autumn it would be in the northwest. In winter it would be in the east, but mostly if in the small hours of morning.

He showed the book to the two interested workers with him. Their statement is completely sure about the nature and truth of the finding. Dr. Willett uses them to help support his idea that the young man was not insane when he started his main strange behaviors. All the other papers were also in Curwen's handwriting. One of them seemed especially important to the writer because of its writing: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a code. The researcher hoped it was the same as the Hutchinson code that had confused him until now. A third paper. Here the searcher was happy, seemed to the observer to be a key to the code. Fifth paeprs were sent to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\". \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\" The papers alos said '. Those Represent'g Them'. Last paper had writing: \"Joseph Curwen his Life. Travells Bet'n ye yeares 1678. 1687: Of Whither He Voyag'd, Where He Stay'd, Whom He Sawe.\n###\nExcited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him.

They were to demolish with axes or gunpow.\n###\nEsek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal. The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast, then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipple\u2019s belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness, and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistle\u2019s range; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipple\u2019s party which was to storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river party\u2019s readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm."}

I had been on a long visit to my family in Arkham. When I returned, I found my friend Phillips in state of uunsual excitement. He told me with great intensity that he had likely solved the problem of the late afternoon mail. His method was from a completely new angle. It involved a more direct and personal collection. I knew he was thinking about a new and irregular walking route. I was not surprised he had planned it. But I was confused about how such a path could help with our ordinary task. The annoying lateness of the mail was mostly due to delays inside the city sorting office itself. I now saw that Phillips had grimly accepted this fact. He plotted his walking course for immediate action, not postponed action. He trusted chance to provide a very recent and unsorted bundle of letters again. This had happened weeks before when we got the circulars left after midnight collection. Finally, chance was favorable. On this occasion, a mailbox waited at the end of the country route. Its contents could not possibly have been sitting there for long. What would be found inside that iron box? Could we hope for a letter of personal and important nature? Phillips did not dare to guess. The trip would be a landmark in our daily watch. He had postponed the first inspectino for my return. This way, both of us could share the discovery in our usual companionship.\n###\nIt was in July, 1910, that the dismal routine regarding the daily correspondence began to alter. I had been on a protracted visit to my relations in Arkham, and upon my return found my companion, Phillips, in a state of singular anticipation. He had, he told me with a feverish intensity, in all likelihood solved the problem of the tardy afternoon delivery through a method from an entirely new angle\u2014that of a more direct and personal retrieval. I had known that he was contemplating a new and highly irregular walking route, and was not astonished that it had been devised; but until he elucidated the particulars I was rather bewildered as to how such a path could aid in our mundane task, since the objectionable lateness of the post was largely due to delays occurring within the municipal sorting office itself. This, I now perceived, Phillips had grimly acknowledged; plotting his pedestrian course for imminent rather than postponed action, and trusting to chance to provide once more a very recent and unsorted bundle of letters, as it had weeks before when we obtained the circulars deposited after the midnight collection. At last chance had been propitious, so that on this occasion there awaited at the terminus of the rural route a mailbox whose contents could not by any possibility have been long stagnant. What would be discovered within that iron receptacle, and whether we could hope for a missive of personal and momentous nature, Phillips did not venture to surmise. The expedition would be a landmark in our daily vigil, and he had postponed the inaugural inspection for my return, so that both might share the revelation in accustomed companionship."}

When the secretary finally put down her pen, I asked her if she would schedule a soon meeting. As I started my request, the pale office face lost calm lack of interest it had shonw during the paperwork. It seemed to show the same odd mix of irritation. Fear I had seen when I first went to the front desk. For a moment I thought about using convincing words. I viewed the rules of such places rather casually. I even tried to get the clerk's work attention. I did this by naming a few of the signs I had experienced the week before. But I did not follow this path for more than a moment. When the quiet worker recognized the described problems, her face suddenly twisted. It showed an expressino completely impsosible to figure out. Her long, cold, bony finger pointed at a calendar. This stopped my talking and silenced the rough listing. As she did this, she showed her bossy nature further. She threw a surprised look toward the single frosted window. It was as if she feared some listener. This look was twice as silly. The office stood alone and separated from all the nearby rooms. This window was the only point in the maze-like building, as the caretaker had told me. From it one could see the old clock tower in the square.\n###\nThose haunting reminders I had neglected, and had often dismissed and postponed with vague unease; so when the secretary at length laid down her pen I asked her if she would arrange an imminent consultation. As I began my request the pallid, bureaucratic visage lost the indifferent placidity it had possessed during the clerical duties, and seemed to shew the same curious mixture of annoyance and apprehension which I had noticed when first I approached the reception desk. For a moment I was inclined to use persuasion, regarding rather lightly the protocols of such establishments; and even tried to awaken the clerk\u2019s professional attention by mentioning a few of the symptoms to which I had been subjected the week before. But I did not pursue this course for more than a moment; for when the taciturn functionary recognised the described ailments her countenance grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond analysis, and her long, cold, bony finger pointed toward a calendar to halt my speech and silence the crude recitation. As she did this she further demonstrated her officiousness by casting a startled glance toward the lone frosted window, as if fearful of some listener\u2014a glance doubly absurd, since the office stood secluded and insulated from all the adjacent chambers, this aperture being the only point in the labyrinthine building, as the custodian had told me, from which one could perceive the ancient clock-tower in the square."}

Slowly I began to feel a strong wonder at crazy. shapes of damaged surface. The table itself was very poor in both material and workmanship. Its complex, giant carvings, though done in a rough. Random way, were clearly patterns that only a planned. Even supernatural force could create. I often asked myself, how could the blind rubbing of a common tool create forms whose rather existence suggested a hidden hint of design? How could any household item have made even a hint of those shining networks of geometry. Depth that the wood grain whispered about in its chaotic damage? More I leaned toward the belief that in the pitiful object before me lay the messy center of something beyond my understanding. Something far beyond the understanding of my more practical. Less observant household.\n###\nBy degrees I commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic configurations of the marred surface. The table itself was pitiably inferior in material and craftsmanship alike; but its intricate, cyclopean etchings, though rendered in a crude and haphazard fashion, were assuredly patterns which only a deliberate or even preternatural force could produce. How, I often asked myself, could the blind abrasion of a common utensil conjure up forms whose very existence argued a lurking spark of design? How could any domestic implement have wrought so much as a suggestion of those glittering networks of abyssal geometry and depth about which the grain whispered in its chaotic disfigurement? More and more I inclined to the belief that in the pitiful object which stood before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension; something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more practical but less perceptive domestic and scholarly colleagues."}

After that Johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side. He did not try to navigate after the first bold flight, for the reaction had taken something out of his soul. Then came the storm of April 2nd, and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness. There is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity, of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comet\u2019s tail, and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit, all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted, hilarious elder gods and the green, bat-winged mocking imps of Tartarus. Out of that dream came rescue\u2014the Vigilant, the vice-admiralty court, the streets of Dunedin, and the long voyage back home to the old house by the Egeberg. He could not tell\u2014they would think him mad. He would write of what he knew before death came, but his wife must not guess. Death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories. That was the document I read, and now I have placed it in the tin box beside the bas-relief and the papers of Professor Angell. With it shall go this record of mine\u2014this test of my own sanity, wherein is pieced together that which I hope may never be pieced together again. I have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror, and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me. But I do not think my life will be long. As my uncle went, as poor Johansen went, so I shall go. I know too much, and the cult still lives. Cthulhu still lives, too, I suppose, again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young. His accursed city is sunken once more, for the Vigilant sailed over the spot after the April storm; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around idol-capped monoliths in lonely places. He must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss, or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy. Who knows the end? What has risen may sink, and what has sunk may rise."}

Suddenly, after a very Scary climb up that curved, steep wall, the person felt his head touch something solid. He knew he must have reached the roof or some kind of floor.

Then came a deadly circuit of the tower, clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give; till finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding, and I turned upward again, pushing the slab or door with my head as I used both hands in my fearful ascent. There was no light revealed above, and as my hands went higher I knew that my climb was for the nonce ended; since the slab was the trap-door of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater circumference than the lower tower, no doubt the floor of some lofty and capacious observation chamber. I crawled through carefully, and tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into place; but failed in the latter attempt. As I lay exhausted on the stone floor I heard the eerie echoes of its fall, but hoped when necessary to pry it open again."}

On an afternoon in early September Arthur Munroe, he listened to the story. It is seen from the start that he was interested and caring. When the account finished, he analyzed. Discussed the matter with great skill. His advice was also very practical. He suggested delaying work at the Martense house. One should first get more detailed historical and geographical information. On his suggestion, the countryside was searched for information about the terrible Martense family. A man was found who had a very helpful old family diary. There was also long talk with the mountain people who had not run away from the fear. Disorder to farther slopes. It was planned to do a compltee. Final check of places linked to various settler legend tragedies. This would come before the main task. The main task was a complete.

I saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic, and when I had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgment. His advice, moreover, was eminently practical; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the Martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data. On his initiative we combed the countryside for information regarding the terrible Martense family, and discovered a man who possessed a marvellously illuminating ancestral diary. We also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes, and arranged to precede our culminating task\u2014the exhaustive and definitive examination of the mansion in the light of its detailed history\u2014with an equally exhaustive and definitive examination of spots associated with the various tragedies of squatter legend."}

Though very primitvie. Ancient in some ways, the thing had a set of nerve centers. Connecitons indicating the highest level of specialized development. Its five-lobed brain was surprisingly sophisticated. There were indications of sensory equipment. This was partly served by the wiry hairs on the head. It involved ellements foreign to any other earth organism. Probably it had more than five senses. Therefore, its habits could not be guessed from any known comparison. It must, Lake thought, haev been a creature of sharp sensitivity. Finely distinct functions in its original world. It was much like the ants and bees of today. It reproduced like non-flowering plants, particularly ferns. It had spore cases at the ends of thee wings.

Though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects, the thing had a set of ganglial centres and connectives arguing the very extremes of specialised development. Its five-lobed brain was surprisingly advanced; and there were signs of a sensory equipment, served in part through the wiry cilia of the head, involving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism. Probably it had more than five senses, so that its habits could not be predicted from any existing analogy. It must, Lake thought, have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and delicately differentiated functions in its primal world; much like the ants and bees of today. It reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams, especially the pteridophytes; having spore-cases at the tips of the wings and evidently developing from a thallus or prothallus."}

I thought such watching was truly useful as a record of the building's design. The light still felt disturbingly like a medical exam. I pushed that thought away with strong willpower. When I noted it, I treated the glow as something I saw. But at all other times, I looked away from it like any harsh modern annoyance. I never mentioned these features in normal talk. News of my close looking, as such odd things do, caused various quiet talks about my eye sensitivity. It is funny to think these talks were only among people who did not know, with no support from eye doctors.\n###\nI continued, however, to maintain a vigilant observation of the sterile brightness which pervaded the corridor so oppressively and uniformly. Such an observation, I reasoned, was of genuine merit as an architectural document. The illumination still seemed unnervingly like a clinical exposure, though I dismissed this notion with a considerable measure of resolve. In noting it, I treated the luminescence as a phenomenon perceived; but at all other times I averted my gaze from it like any garish imposition of the modern age. I had never remarked upon such qualities in casual discourse; though reports of my scrutiny, leaking out as such peculiarities will, had provoked sundry whispers regarding my ocular sensitivity. It is amusing to reflect that these whispers were confined wholly to the uninformed, without a single advocate among optometrists or illuminatory engineers."}

The table - stone stands among its mound of bones. talk began when Silas Bishop, from the Bishops, mentioned seeing the boy running up that hill of his mother. This was an hour before the fire was noticed. Silas was gathering a cow. He forgot his task when he saw the two figures in the light of his lantern. They moved through underbrush. The watcher seemed to think they were. he could not be about the boy. The boy may have had some kind of belt. A pair of shorts. Wilbur was seen and without and clothing. Any messing up. Threat of messing up his clothes seemed to fill him with anger. His difference from his mother and grandfather in this way was thought. This was until the horror of 1928 suggested the reason. The January, gossips were that \" Lavinny 's child \" had started to talk. He was eleven months. His speech was. This was both because it was from the accents of the area. Because it showed no baby lisp. children of three or four could be of speech. The boy did not takl. When he spoke, he seemed to show some - to - grasp quality lacking in Dunwich. strangeness was not in what he said. in the phrases he used. It seemed to his tone of voice. To the organs that produced the spoken sounds. His face was for its maturity. Though he shared his mother 's. Grandfather 's lack of chin, his firm. - shaped nose combined with the look in his,, eyes. This gave him an air of - adulthood and intelligence., he was despite his look of brightness. There was something goat - like. Animal about his lips, - pored, skin, hair. ears.\n###\nIt was somewhat after this time\u2014on Hallowe\u2019en\u2014that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop\u2014of the undecayed Bishops\u2014mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons. The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that \u201cLavinny\u2019s black brat\u201d had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears."}

I knew exactlly the awful, unthinkable comparison that had made him do it. We had thought that if the mists cleared enough, we would look back. See a terrible. Deeply movnig being. We had a clear picture of that being in our minds. What we actually saw was something completely different. It was much more horrible and hatfeul than we imagined. The mists had thinned in a very bad way. It was the complete, real form of the fantasy writer's 'thing that should not exist'. The closest thing you can compare it to is a huge, fast-moving subbway train. You see it from a station platform. The great black front appears hugely out of the endless underground distnace.

This, I now saw, West had clearly recognised; creating his embalming compound for future rather than immediate use, and trusting to fate to supply again some very recent and unburied corpse, as it had years before when we obtained the negro killed in the Bolton prize-fight.

So finally they started eagerly toward the nearest tunnel.\n###\nIt was now 8 P.M., and we had not enough battery replacements to let our torches burn on forever. We had done so much of our studying and copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly continuous use; and despite the special dry cell formula would obviously be good for only about four more\u2014though by keeping one torch unused, except for especially interesting or difficult places, we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that. It would not do to be without a light in these Cyclopean catacombs, hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further mural deciphering. Of course we intended to revisit the place for days and perhaps weeks of intensive study and photography\u2014curiosity having long ago got the better of horror\u2014but just now we must hasten. Our supply of trail-blazing paper was far from unlimited, and we were reluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment it; but we did let one large notebook go. If worst came to worst, we could resort to rock-chipping\u2014and of course it would be possible, even in case of really lost direction, to work up to full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial and error. So at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnel."}

He tried hard to analyze it and compared notes with Akeley. It is not useful to repeat all their concluisons. He might say they agreed they found a clue to the source of repulsive old customs in ancient human religions. It also seemed plain to them that there were ancient alliances between hidden outer creatures. They had no way to guess how extensive these alliancse were. How they changed over time. Yet there was room for limitless horrified speculation. There seemed to be an awful, ancient connection in several stages between humans. The blasphemies on Earth were hinted to come from the dark planet Yuggoth at the solar system's edge. But that planet was merely a populated outpost of a frightful interstellar race. Their ultimate source is far outside even the Einsteinian space-time continuum.

It seemed plain to us, also, that there were ancient and elaborate alliances between the hidden outer creatures and certain members of the human race. How extensive these alliances were, and how their state today might compare with their state in earlier ages, we had no means of guessing; yet at best there was room for a limitless amount of horrified speculation.

Someone knew Denys Barry well in America. He became rich there. Congratulations were given when he bought back the old castle near the bog in quiet Kilderry. His father came from Kilderry. He wanted to enjoy his wealth there among his family's old places. Men of his family once ruled Kilderry and built and lived in the castle. But taht was long ago. For many yaers castle was empty and falling apart. After he went to Ireland, he often wrote letters. He reported that under his care the grey castle was being rebuilt tower by tower to its old glory. He said the ivy was slowly growing over the repaired walls, like it did centuries ago. He said the peasants thanked him for bringing back the old days with his gold from overseas. But later, problems came. It was seen that the peasants stopped thanking him. They ran away as if from a bad fate. Then a letter was sent and a visit was asked for. He was lonely in the castle. He had no one to talk to except the new servants. Workers he brought from the north.\n###\nI had known Denys Barry well in America, where he had grown rich, and had congratulated him when he bought back the old castle by the bog at sleepy Kilderry. It was from Kilderry that his father had come, and it was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes. Men of his blood had once ruled over Kilderry and built and dwelt in the castle, but those days were very remote, so that for generations the castle had been empty and decaying. After he went to Ireland Barry wrote me often, and told me how under his care the grey castle was rising tower by tower to its ancient splendour; how the ivy was climbing slowly over the restored walls as it had climbed so many centuries ago, and how the peasants blessed him for bringing back the old days with his gold from over the sea. But in time there came troubles, and the peasants ceased to bless him, and fled away instead as from a doom. And then he sent a letter and asked me to visit him, for he was lonely in the castle with no one to speak to save the new servants and labourers he had brought from the north."}

They felt a very strong sense of coming wonders. They had felt a similar sense four hours before. They felt it when approaching the unexplored mountain pass. True, they had already seen the amazing secret hidden by the mountain peaks. Yet, the idea of actually going inside ancient walls was still awe-inspiring. The walls were built by thinking beings maybe millions of years ago. This was before any known huamn race could have lived. The idea was also potentially frightening. It suggested something abnormal in the universe. The air was thin at this great height. This made physical effort harder than usual. But both Danforth and the observer were doing veyr well. They felt ready for almost any job they might have to do. After only a few steps, they reached a ruined shape worn flat with the snow. Ten or fifteen rods farther, there was a huge wall with no roof. It was still complete in its giant five-pointed shape. It rose to a uneven height of ten or eleven feet. They went toward this wall. Finally, they could actually touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks. They felt they had made a new and almost wrong connection. It was a link to forgotten ages normally not oepn to their kind.\n###\nWalking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west, we felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously. True, we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years ago\u2014before any known race of men could have existed\u2014was none the less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality. Though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat more difficult than usual; both Danforth and I found ourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our lot. It took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet. For this latter we headed; and when at last we were able actually to touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our species."}

It blew and from that opening. That was where the whistling came from. I remember jumping and stumbling over all kinds of obstacles. The rush of wind and the screaming sound grew every momnet. It seemed to curl and twist around me on purpose. It struck at me from the spaces and below me. though the wind was at my back, it slowed me down of helping me move. It felt like a rope or lasso had been thrown around me. of noise I made, I scrambled over a wall of blocks. I was in the passage that led to the surface. I remember seeing the archway to the machine room. I shouted when I saw the slope going. That slope led to where one of those trap doors must be, two levels. But I did not shout. I kept repeating to myself that this was all a dream. I would wake up. I was in camp. I was at home in Arkham. These hopes helped keep my mind. I started to climb the slope to the level. I knew I had to cross the four - foot crack. I was shaken by fears to understand the terror until I was. When I went, jumping was. But could I jump the gap going? I was hindered by fear, tiredness, the weight of the metal case. The pull of that demon wind. I thought of these things at the moment. I thought of the beings that might be hiding in the depths below the crack. My flickering flashlight was getting. But some memory told me when I was near the crack. The blasts of wind. The sickening whistling screams behind me were like a drug for a moment. They numbed my imagination to the horror of the opening. I became of blasts and whistling in front of me. Waves of horror surged up through the crack itself. They came form depths that can not be imagined., the essence of nightmare was on me. Sanity was gone. I ignored everything except the animal urge to run. I fought and pushed over the rubble on the slope. I acted as if the crack did not exist.\n###\nThere was a wind, too\u2014not merely a cool, damp draught, but a violent, purposeful blast belching savagely and frigidly from that abominable gulf whence the obscene whistling came. There are memories of leaping and lurching over obstacles of every sort, with that torrent of wind and shrieking sound growing moment by moment, and seeming to curl and twist purposefully around me as it struck out wickedly from the spaces behind and beneath. Though in my rear, that wind had the odd effect of hindering instead of aiding my progress; as if it acted like a noose or lasso thrown around me. Heedless of the noise I made, I clattered over a great barrier of blocks and was again in the structure that led to the surface. I recall glimpsing the archway to the room of machines and almost crying out as I saw the incline leading down to where one of those blasphemous trap-doors must be yawning two levels below. But instead of crying out I muttered over and over to myself that this was all a dream from which I must soon awake. Perhaps I was in camp\u2014perhaps I was at home in Arkham. As these hopes bolstered up my sanity I began to mount the incline to the higher level. I knew, of course, that I had the four-foot cleft to re-cross, yet was too racked by other fears to realise the full horror until I came almost upon it. On my descent, the leap across had been easy\u2014but could I clear the gap as readily when going uphill, and hampered by fright, exhaustion, the weight of the metal case, and the anomalous backward tug of that daemon wind? I thought of these things at the last moment, and thought also of the nameless entities which might be lurking in the black abysses below the chasm. My wavering torch was growing feeble, but I could tell by some obscure memory when I neared the cleft. The chill blasts of wind and the nauseous whistling shrieks behind me were for the moment like a merciful opiate, dulling my imagination to the horror of the yawning gulf ahead. And then I became aware of the added blasts and whistling in front of me\u2014tides of abomination surging up through the cleft itself from depths unimagined and unimaginable. Now, indeed, the essence of pure nightmare was upon me. Sanity departed\u2014and ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight, I merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline\u2019s debris as if no gulf had existed."}

These were about Lake's start northwest into areas never walked by humans. Imagined by them. We did not mention his wild hopes of changing all of biology and geology. His initial sled. Drilling trip from January 11 to 18 included Pabodie. It was spoiled by losing two dogs. This happened when their sled overturned crossing a pressure ridge in the ice. The trip brought up more of the Arhcaean slate. Even we weer interested by the unusual number of clear fossil marks in that incredibly rock layer. However, these marks were of very simple life forms. They presented no major puzzle, except that any life should be in rock this clearly pre-Cambrian. So, we still did not understand the reason for Lake's request. He wanted a berak in our time-saving plan. This berak needed all four planes, many men, and all the expedition's equipment. We did not finally reject the plan. We decided not to go with the northwest group, even though Lake asked for our geology advice. While tehy were away, we would stay at the base with Pabodie and five men. We would make final plans for the move east. To prepare for this move, one plane had started bringing a gasoline supply from McMurdo Sound. But this could wait for a while. We kept one sled and nine dogs with us. It is not wise to be without possible transport in a completely world of death.\n###\nPopular imagination, I judge, responded actively to our wireless bulletins of Lake\u2019s start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human imagination; though we did not mention his wild hopes of revolutionising the entire sciences of biology and geology. His preliminary sledging and boring journey of January 11\u201318 with Pabodie and five others\u2014marred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great pressure-ridges in the ice\u2014had brought up more and more of the Archaean slate; and even I was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that unbelievably ancient stratum. These markings, however, were of very primitive life-forms involving no great paradox except that any life-forms should occur in rock as definitely pre-Cambrian as this seemed to be; hence I still failed to see the good sense of Lake\u2019s demand for an interlude in our time-saving programme\u2014an interlude requiring the use of all four planes, many men, and the whole of the expedition\u2019s mechanical apparatus. I did not, in the end, veto the plan; though I decided not to accompany the northwestward party despite Lake\u2019s plea for my geological advice. While they were gone, I would remain at the base with Pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward shift. In preparation for this transfer one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline supply from McMurdo Sound; but this could wait temporarily. I kept with me one sledge and nine dogs, since it is unwise to be at any time without possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of aeon-long death."}

They will connect it with the known facts. They will ask themselves how I could have believed anything else after seeing the proof of that horror. That horror is thing on the doorstep. Before that, I also saw only madness in the wild stories I have followed. Even now I ask myself if I was wrong. Or I ask if I am not mad after all. I do not know. But others have strange things to tell about Edward and Asenath Derby. Even the calm police are confused about that last terrible visit. They have tried weakly to create a theory of a terrible joke. Warning by fired servants. They know in their hearts that the truth is something much more terrible. Hard to believe. So I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. Rather have I gotten revenge for him. In doing so, I have removed from the earth a horror. Its survival might have released countless terrors on all people. There are dark areas of shadow close to our daily paths. Now and then some evil soul breaks a way through. When that happens, the man who knows must act before thinking about results. I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years younger than me, he was. Advanced that we had much in common from the time he was eight. I was sixteen. He was the most amazing child student I have ever known. At seven, he was writing poetry of a dark, strange, almost unhealthy style. This surprised the teachers around him. Perhaps his private education and sheltered life had something to do with his early development. An only child, he had physical weakensses. These weaknesses worried his loving parents and made them keep him very close to them. He was never allowed out without his nurse. He rarely had a chance to play freely with other children. All this likely encouraged a strange, secret inner life in the boy. Imagination was his one path to freedom. In any case, his childhood learning was huge and odd. His easy writings captivated me even though I was older. About that time, I had interests in art of a somewhat strange style. I found in this younger child a rare like-minded spirit. What was behind our shared love of shadows. Wonders was, no doubt, the ancient, decaying. Slightly sacry town where we lived. It was town cursed by witches and full of legends. It was Arkham. Its crowded, sloping gambrel roofs. Crumbling Georgian railings have watched over the centuries beside the darkly whispering Miskatonic.\n###\nLater some of my readers will weigh each statement, correlate it with the known facts, and ask themselves how I could have believed otherwise than as I did after facing the evidence of that horror\u2014that thing on the doorstep. Until then I also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales I have acted on. Even now I ask myself whether I was misled\u2014or whether I am not mad after all. I do not know\u2014but others have strange things to tell of Edward and Asenath Derby, and even the stolid police are at their wits\u2019 ends to account for that last terrible visit. They have tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by discharged servants, yet they know in their hearts that the truth is something infinitely more terrible and incredible. So I say that I have not murdered Edward Derby. Rather have I avenged him, and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might have loosed untold terrors on all mankind. There are black zones of shadow close to our daily paths, and now and then some evil soul breaks a passage through. When that happens, the man who knows must strike before reckoning the consequences. I have known Edward Pickman Derby all his life. Eight years my junior, he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and I sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic, almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All this doubtless fostered a strange, secretive inner life in the boy, with imagination as his one avenue of freedom. At any rate, his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre; and his facile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age. About that time I had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast, and I found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit. What lay behind our joint love of shadows and marvels was, no doubt, the ancient, mouldering, and subtly fearsome town in which we lived\u2014witch-cursed, legend-haunted Arkham, whose huddled, sagging gambrel roofs and crumbling Georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the darkly muttering Miskatonic."}

He once stopped at a farmhouse well to get a cup of [THING]. All the dogs barked in fear at the unseen zoogs that moved through the grass behind him. At another [THING], where [THING] were awake, he asked questions about the gods. He asked if they often danced upon Lerion. His wife only made the Elder Sign. Told him the way to Nir. At noon, he walked through the one wide main [THING] of Nir. He had visited this place before. It was the farthest he had ever traveled in this direction. Soon after, he reached the great [THING] bridge across the Skai. When the bridge was built thirteen hundred years ago, the builders had sealed a living human sacrifice inside its central support pillar. On the other side of Once, many cats were often seen. All the cats arched their backs at the zoogs that followed him. This showed that Ulthar was nearby. In Ulthar, an old and important law said no [THING] may kill a [THING]. The areas just outside Ulthar were very pleasant. There were small green cottages and neatly fenced farms. The old [THING] itself was even more pleasant. It had old pointed roofs and upper floors that hung over the streets. There were countless chimneys and narrow uphill streets. One could see old cobblestones whenever the graceful cats left enough space. Carter moved carefully because the cats were somewhat scattered by the half - seen zoogs. He went straight to the modest Temple of the Eledr Ones. It was said the priests and old records were kept there. Once inside that old round [THING] tower covered with ivyhe looked for the elder priest Atal. This priest had climbed the forbidden peak Hatheg - Kla in the stony desert. Had come back down alive. Atal sat on an ivory platform in a decorated shrine at the top of the temple. He was fully three hundred years old. But his mind and memory were still very sharp. From him, Carter learned many things about the gods. Mainly, he learned they are truly only the gods of [THING]. They rule our own dreamland weakly and have no power or home anywhere else. Atal said they might listen to a [THING] 's prayer if they were in a good mood. One must not think of climbing to their onyx fortress on top of Kadath in the cold desert. It was fortunate that no [THING] knew where Kadath towers stand. The results of climbing it would be very serious. Atal 's companion Barzai the Wise had been pulled screaming into the [THING] just for climbnig the known peak of Hatheg - Kla.\n###\nOnce he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water, and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind. At another house, where people were stirring, he asked questions about the gods, and whether they danced often upon Lerion; but the farmer and his wife would only make the Elder Sign and tell him the way to Nir and Ulthar. At noon he walked through the one broad high street of Nir, which he had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the Skai, into whose central pier the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it thirteen-hundred years before. Once on the other side, the frequent presence of cats (who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs) revealed the near neighbourhood of Ulthar; for in Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man may kill a cat. Very pleasant were the suburbs of Ulthar, with their little green cottages and neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself, with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough. Carter, the cats being somewhat dispersed by the half-seen zoogs, picked his way directly to the modest Temple of the Elder Ones where the priests and old records were said to be; and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied stone\u2014which crowns Ulthar\u2019s highest hill\u2014he sought out the patriarch Atal, who had been up the forbidden peak Hatheg-Kla in the stony desert and had come down again alive. Atal, seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple, was fully three centuries old; but still very keen of mind and memory. From him Carter learned many things about the gods, but mainly that they are indeed only earth\u2019s gods, ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere. They might, Atal said, heed a man\u2019s prayer if in good humour; but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop Kadath in the cold waste. It was lucky that no man knew where Kadath towers, for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave. Atal\u2019s companion Barzai the Wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of Hatheg-Kla."}

So, we only made sure the landing skis were secure. We also protected the important parts of the plane from the cold. For our walk, we left behind our heaviest flying clothes. We took a small set of gear. This included a pocket compass, a hand camera, light food, many notebooks. Paper, a geologist's hammer. Chisel, bags for samples, a coil of climbing rope. Strong eletcric lights with extra batteries. We carried this equipment in the plane. We carride it in case we could land. We wanted to take ground pictures, make drawings. Get rock samples from some bare slope, rock outcrop. Fortunately also had extra paper. We could tear it up, put it in a spare sample bag. Use it to mark our path. This was based on the old hare-and-hounds method. We would use it in any indoor mazes we might enter. We brought this in case we found a cave system. The air in the cave needed to be still enough for this method. It would be a fast.

A heavy, wet feeling moved around the tangled linens. So the carrier felt burdende as he did them unwilling serviec. Basket-carrying chore was there. There wree playful socks and odd undergarments.

The gate to the abyss was beyond that. I will not describe our trip. We kept leaving a trail of paper. The trpi was like the one to the end. But it stayed to the ground. It went down to basement halls. we saw marks in the trash under our feet. After we left the gasoline smell, we noticed that smell. It came in waves. After our path split from the one, we shone our light on the walls. We saw carvings. These carvings were a art form for the Old Ones. Around 9:30 PM, we walked down a hall with a roof. The floor was and seemed below ground. The roof got as we went. We saw daylight. We turned off our light. We seemed to be nearing a place. We could not be from the surface. The hall ended in a arch for ruins. We could see a lot through it before we went out. Beyond was a space. It was 200 feet. It was of rubble. It had blocked arches like the one we would cross. The walls had carvings where. The art was despite weather damage from being. The floor was. We thought the floor was. But the feature was a stone ramp. It avoided the arches by turning onto the floor. It spiraled up the wall. It was like the version of ramps on Babylon towers. Our flight and the view from the air hid this. The descent seemed part of the wall. That is why we missed it from the air. That made us find another way to the ice level.\n###\nThe other neighbouring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that. I need not speak of our journey\u2014during which we continued to leave an economical trail of paper\u2014for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had reached the cul de sac; except that it tended to adhere more closely to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors. Every now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter under foot; and after we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent we were again faintly conscious\u2014spasmodically\u2014of that more hideous and more persistent scent. After the way had branched from our former course we sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls; noting in almost every case the well-nigh omnipresent sculptures, which indeed seem to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the Old Ones. About 9:30 P.M., while traversing a vaulted corridor whose increasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew lower as we advanced, we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to turn off our torch. It appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place, and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great. The corridor ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged. Beyond there stretched a prodigious round space\u2014fully 200 feet in diameter\u2014strown with debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to cross. The walls were\u2014in available spaces\u2014boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic proportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused by the openness of the spot, an artistic splendour far beyond anything we had encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily glaciated, and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depth. But the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which, eluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor, wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique Babylon. Only the rapidity of our flight, and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower\u2019s inner wall, had prevented our noticing this feature from the air, and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the sub-glacial level."}

This effect was permanent. It came from a case involving someone she was once engaged to. That case showed her the horror of a wasted life. Galpin was the fianc\u00e9 in question. He had been one of Appleton's most notable sons. As a boy, Attaining stood out due to his amazing mind. He achieved fame at the University of Wisconsin. At twenty-three, he returned to Appleton. He took a professor job at Lawrence. He also gave a diamond ring to Appleton's finest and smartest daughter. For a while, everything was happy. Then the storm came without warnnig. Evil habits appeared in the professor. These habits started from a first drink years before in a secluded woods. He had to resign quickly. This was to avoid a prosecution. He was accused of harming his pupils' habits and morals. His engagement ended. Galpin moved east to start over. But soon, Appletonians heard news. He was dismissed in disgrace from York University. He had worked there as an instructor in English. Galpin then spent his time in the library and on lecutre stages. He prepared books and speeches on various literary subjects. He always showed a very remarkable genius. It seemed the public might someday forgive his past errors. He gave passionate lectures defending Villon, Poe, Verlaine, and Oscar Wilde. He applied these defenses to himself too. During the brief Indian summer of his glory, people talked. They spoke of a renewed engagement at a cultured home on Park Avenue. But then the final blow fell. A last disgrace came. Compared to it, the earlier ones were nothing. It shattered the illusions of those who believed in Galpin's reform. The man left his name behind. He vanished from public sight. Rumour sometimes linked him to a certain \"Consul Hasting\". This person did work for stage and movie companies. The wokr drew some attention for its scholarly range and depth. But Hasting soon faded from public view. Galpin became just a name. Parents used it in warning tones. Eleanor Wing soon had her marriage to Karl Trever. He was a rising lawyer. Of her former admirer, she kept only enough memory. It was enough to name her only son. It also guided the morals of that hnadsome, strong-willed youth.\n###\nShe had, in her own youth, been deeply and permanently impressed with the horror of dissipation by the case of one to whom she had for a time been engaged. Young Galpin, the fianc\u00e9 in question, had been one of Appleton\u2019s most remarkable sons. Attaining distinction as a boy through his wonderful mentality, he won vast fame at the University of Wisconsin, and at the age of twenty-three returned to Appleton to take up a professorship at Lawrence and to slip a diamond upon the finger of Appleton\u2019s fairest and most brilliant daughter. For a season all went happily, till without warning the storm burst. Evil habits, dating from a first drink taken years before in woodland seclusion, made themselves manifest in the young professor; and only by a hurried resignation did he escape a nasty prosecution for injury to the habits and morals of the pupils under his charge. His engagement broken, Galpin moved east to begin life anew; but before long, Appletonians heard of his dismissal in disgrace from New York University, where he had obtained an instructorship in English. Galpin now devoted his time to the library and lecture platform, preparing volumes and speeches on various subjects connected with belles lettres, and always shewing a genius so remarkable that it seemed as if the public must sometime pardon him for his past mistakes. His impassioned lectures in defence of Villon, Poe, Verlaine, and Oscar Wilde were applied to himself as well, and in the short Indian summer of his glory there was talk of a renewed engagement at a certain cultured home on Park Avenue. But then the blow fell. A final disgrace, compared to which the others had been as nothing, shattered the illusions of those who had come to believe in Galpin\u2019s reform; and the young man abandoned his name and disappeared from public view. Rumour now and then associated him with a certain \u201cConsul Hasting\u201d whose work for the stage and for motion-picture companies attracted a certain degree of attention because of its scholarly breadth and depth; but Hasting soon disappeared from the public eye, and Galpin became only a name for parents to quote in warning accents. Eleanor Wing soon celebrated her marriage to Karl Trever, a rising young lawyer, and of her former admirer retained only enough memory to dictate the naming of her only son, and the moral guidance of that handsome and headstrong youth."}

They had placed those basic chairs in the clean walls. They neevr stopped working at those chairs. Now the connection was clearer. I studied the options more carefully. I remembered that the cheerful tones must come from the unseen receptionist. I thought about the routines of the clinic, which had no name. Many things were strange and hard to explain. The scheduling system included a digital calendar. It seemed to be of a higher level than the much later methods of paper books. Yet there were odd gaps.

I wondered about the lack of information on sudden illnesses. It was as if an ideal of permanent dental work had been encouraged as a comforting false idea.\n###\nAs I dialed the number toward the automated voice I heard later stages of the recorded menu\u2014the leave-taking of the office that had dwelt in the suburban plaza and the neighborhood around for ten thousand days; the practice whose staff shrank from quitting hours their patients had known so long, where they had settled as fixtures in the building\u2019s youth, carving in the sterile walls those primal chairs at which they never ceased to labor. Now that the connection was clearer I studied the options more closely, and, remembering that the cheerful tones must represent the unseen receptionist, pondered upon the rituals of the nameless clinic. Many things were peculiar and inexplicable. The scheduling system, which included a digital calendar, had seemingly risen to a higher order than those immeasurably later methods of paper ledgers and telephone books, yet there were curious omissions. I could, for example, find no slots to represent cancellations or emergency visits, save such as were related to holidays, weekends, and plagues; and I wondered at the reticence shewn concerning sudden ailments. It was as though an ideal of dental permanence had been fostered as a cheering illusion."}

But a great disappointment happened to me. I found the materials to refill the portable lgiht were destroyed. They were lost in the mutiny of those pigs in July. My anger was extreme. Yet my German sense stopped me from going unprepared into a completely black interior. It might be the homee of some indescribable sea monster. or it might be a maze of passages I could never escape from. All I could do was turn on the fading searchlight of the U-29. With its help, I walked up temple steps and studiedd the outside carvings. The light beam went through the door at an upward angle. I looked in to see if I could see anything, but I saw nothing. Not even the roof was visible. I tested the floor with staff and took a step or two inside. But I did not dare go further. Also, for the first time in my life, i felt the emotion of dread. I began to understand how some of poor Klenze's moods started. The temple attracted me more and more. Yet I feared its watery depths with a blind and growing terror. I went back to the submarine.

Not even the roof was visible; and though I took a step or two inside after testing the floor with a staff, I dared not go farther.

It went down to the old \"Town Street\" that the founders built by the river in 1636. Many small, aged lnaes were there. The hosues were very old and leaned together. A person might be interested. It took a long time to walk through thees old, narrow streets. People were afraid they might be a draem or lead to unknown fears. It seemed easier to keep walking along Benefit Street. They passed the iron fence of St. John's hidden churchyard. They passed the back of the 1761 Colony House. The large, decaying Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. On At Meeting Streeta person would look up to the east. They would see the arched steps road used to climb the slope. Looking down to the west, they would see the old colonial brick schoolhouse. It faces the ancient Sign of Shakespeare's Head across the road. The Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed there bfeore the Revolution. Next, they came to the beautiful First Baptist Church from 1775. It had a very fine Gibbs steeple. Nearby were Georgian roofs and cupolas. The area here and to the south became nicer. It ended with a remarkable group of early large houses. But the small, ancient lanes still went down the steep hill to the west. They looked ghostly with their many gables. They dipped down to a messy area of colorful decay. This is where the old, bad waterfront area was. It remembered its proud East India dyas amnog many languages, vice, and dirt. There were rotting wharves and dim ship supply shops. Some old alley names survived, like Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime.\n###\nWestward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old \u201cTown Street\u201d that the founders had laid out at the river\u2019s edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. John\u2019s hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street\u2014the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods\u2014he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespear\u2019s Head where the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent."}

On the right, the black cut of the river valley is seen splitting the view. Old factories and a train station are seen stuck to its sides like barnacles. Past that, old railway. Rowley road are seen going through flat, wet land. This land has small areas of higher, drire land with bushes. On the left, the country with mayn small streams is seen to be colser. The narrow road to Ipswich shines white in the moonlight. The road going south toward Arkham could not be seen from that side of the hotel. That road had been chosen.\n###\nAs I thought of these things I looked out over the squalid sea of decaying roofs below me, now brightened by the beams of a moon not much past full. On the right the black gash of the river-gorge clove the panorama; abandoned factories and railway station clinging barnacle-like to its sides. Beyond it the rusted railway and the Rowley road led off through a flat, marshy terrain dotted with islets of higher and dryer scrub-grown land. On the left the creek-threaded countryside was nearer, the narrow road to Ipswich gleaming white in the moonlight. I could not see from my side of the hotel the southward route toward Arkham which I had determined to take."}

In that distant, terrible place, we made the correct call. But we did not need to. As we opened our mouths, we heard the chorus grow louder and closer. We saw swfit shadows against the stars. Small, graceful shapes jumped from hill to hill in growing numbers. The clan's call had been given. Before the foul procession could even be scared, a cloud of thick fur. line of sharp claws were upon it powerfully. The flutes stopped. There were shrieks in night. Dying almost-humans screamed. Cats hissed, yowled, and roared. The toad-things made no sound.

But that he need not have done, for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer, and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions. The call of the clan had been given, and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it.

All the vague clues agreed on certain basic points. Noises of a ritual nature definitely existed. They happened at times when the bungalow was dark. They might have come from known cellar, of course. But rumor said there were deeper and more extensive underground rooms. Recalling the old stories about Joseph Curwne's underground passages. They assumed the current bungalow was chosen because it was on the old Curwen site. This was shown in one of the documents found behind the picture. Willett and Mr. Ward paid a lot of attention to this part of the gossip. They searched many times without success for the door in the river bank that old manuscripts mentioned. Regarding public opinion about the bungalow's various residents, it soon became clear. The Brava Portuguese was hated. The bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen was feared. The pale young scholar was deeply disliked. In the last week or two, we had obviously changed a lot. We stopped tryign to be friendly. We only spoke in hoarse.

They used small boats to land on Ross Island with difficulty. This was just after midnight on the morning of the 9th. They carried a cable line from each ship. They prepared to unload supplies using a breeches-buoy system. Their feelings when first stepping on Antarctic soil were strong and mixed. This was true even though the Scott and Shackleton expeditions had been there before them. Their camp on the frozen shore below the volcano's slope was only temporary. Their headquarters stayed on the Arkham. They landed all their drilling equipment, dogs, sledges, tents, food, gasoline tanks, an experimental ice-melting outfit, regular. Aeiral cameras, airplane parts. This included three small portable wireless sets. These were besides the ones in the planes. These sets could talk to the Arkham's large set from any part of Antarctica they might visit. The ship's set could talk to the outside world. It was to send news reports to the Arkham Advertiser's powerful wireless station on Kingsport Head, Mass. They hoped to finish their work in one Antarctic summer.

Shielding himself from realizing why, he gave the detectives an item to show to Pawtuxet shopkeepers who had seen the Dr. Allen. That item was a photo of his son. On it, he drew in ink the glasses. Black pointed beard the men brought from Allen 's room. For two hours, he waited with the doctor in the house. A smell gathered as the panel in the library stared. the men returned. Yes. The photo was a likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned, and Willett wiped his forehead with a handkerchief. AllenCurwenhe had been all morning, there was a change. He slipped out and swaggered past the hired guards. That was the time, when he was. But nothis room? What had he found? Waitwas that an shadow. Horror forcing itself on a trembling person who left? Had not the butler mentioned noises? Willett rang for the man and asked him some questions. It had,, been a business. There had been noises \u2014 a cry, a gasp, chkoing. A kind of clattering. All of these. And Mr. Charles was not the when he stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he spoke. Sniffed the air blowing down from an window.\n###\nIn the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allen\u2019s room. For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen\u2014Ward\u2014Curwen\u2014it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too \u2018squeamish\u2019, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \u201cCurwen\u201d must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received\u2014he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no\u2014had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study\u2014this very room? What had he found there? Or wait\u2014what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go\u2014was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises? Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises\u2014a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word.

The observers did a lot of unsure whispering. Most importantly, they did not leave without looking further. Having come this far, they did not want to be stopped by anything less than sure disaster. Anyway, what they likely suspected was too unbelievable. Such things did not happen in any normal world. It was probably pure irartional instinct that made them dim their single torch.

Look over the edge of the world at the air. He listened to bells and the crise of what might have been seagulls., when the mist would clear. The sea become with the smoke of steamships, he would sigh. Go dwon to town., he loved to walk through the streets and down the hill. He liked to study the leaning roof peaks and doorways with pillars. These had sheltered generations of sea people. He talked with the Terrible Old Man, who did not like strangers. He was invited inot the man 's cottage. Its ceilings. Worm - eaten wood panels hear the echoes of disturbing talks to oneself in the morning hours., it was that Olney would notice the unvisited cottage in the sky. It was on that cliff that is one with the mists. It hung over Kingsport. Its mystery was whispered through Kingsport 's alleys. The Terrible Old Man told a wheezing story that his father had told him. It was about lightning that shot up one night from that cottage to the clouds of heaven. Granny Orne, whose house with a - sloped roof in Ship Street is all covered with moss. Ivy, croaked about something her grandmother had heard. It was about shapes that flew out of the mists into the door of that place. The door is set to the edge of the cliff toward the ocean. It can be seen form ships at sea., being for things. Held by neither the Kingsporter 's fear nor the summer visitor 's laziness, Olney made a decision. Despite a upbringinghe swore a oath to climb that avoided cliff. Visit the cottage in the sky. his self argude that the place must be lived in by people who reached it from along the ridge beside the Miskatonic River 's mouth. they traded in Arkham, knowing how Kingsport liked their home. Or they were to climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. Olney walked out along the cliffs to where the cliff jumped up to be with things. He became that no feet could climb up. Go down that overhanging slope.\n###\nMorning after morning he would lie on the cliffs and look over the world\u2019s rim at the cryptical aether beyond, listening to spectral bells and the wild cries of what might have been gulls. Then, when the mist would lift and the sea stand out prosy with the smoke of steamers, he would sigh and descend to the town, where he loved to thread the narrow olden lanes up and down hill, and study the crazy tottering gables and odd pillared doorways which had sheltered so many generations of sturdy sea-folk. And he even talked with the Terrible Old Man, who was not fond of strangers, and was invited into his fearsomely archaic cottage where low ceilings and wormy panelling hear the echoes of disquieting soliloquies in the dark small hours. Of course it was inevitable that Olney should mark the grey unvisited cottage in the sky, on that sinister northward crag which is one with the mists and the firmament. Always over Kingsport it hung, and always its mystery sounded in whispers through Kingsport\u2019s crooked alleys. The Terrible Old Man wheezed a tale that his father had told him, of lightning that shot one night up from that peaked cottage to the clouds of higher heaven; and Granny Orne, whose tiny gambrel-roofed abode in Ship Street is all covered with moss and ivy, croaked over something her grandmother had heard at second-hand, about shapes that flapped out of the eastern mists straight into the narrow single door of that unreachable place\u2014for the door is set close to the edge of the crag toward the ocean, and glimpsed only from ships at sea. At length, being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the Kingsporter\u2019s fear nor the summer boarder\u2019s usual indolence, Olney made a very terrible resolve. Despite a conservative training\u2014or because of it, for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the unknown\u2014he swore a great oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit the abnormally antique grey cottage in the sky. Very plausibly his saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people who reached it from inland along the easier ridge beside the Miskatonic\u2019s estuary. Probably they traded in Arkham, knowing how little Kingsport liked their habitation, or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. Olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things, and became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on that beetling southern slope."}

Death is merciful, for there is no return therefrom, but with him who has come back out of the nethermost chambers of night, haggard and knowing, peace rests nevermore. Fool that I was to plunge with such unsanctioned phrensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate; fool or god that he was\u2014my only friend, who led me and went before me, and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be mine. We met, I recall, in a railway station, where he was the centre of a crowd of the vulgarly curious. He was unconscious, having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight black-clad body a strange rigidity. I think he was then approaching forty years of age, for there were deep lines in the face, wan and hollow-cheeked, but oval and actually beautiful; and touches of grey in the thick, waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black."}

He gave no explanations to his wife. In his calmer moments, he spoke of the urgent need for a long talk wtih the owners of the storage store. His more feverish talk was very disturbing indeed. It included desperate pleas that certain items in a long-closed closet be removed. It also included dream-like references to some plan. This plan was to remove all extra clothes and every outdated accessory from the home. This would be done by the unstoppable, advancnig force of disorder and decay. He would cry out that the home's order was in danger. This was because the older forces of mess wanted to overcome it. They wanted to pull it away from the world of neatness. The universe of organization. They wanted to pull it into some chaotic level or state of being. It had been taken from that state countless seasons before. At other times, he would call for the feared book of home knowledge. He would call for the mysterious writing on space recovery. He seemed hopeful of finding some method in them. He wanted to stop the disorder he saw so clearly in his mind.\n###\nMr. Armitage rested, but was partly distracted the following afternoon. He offered no clarifications to his spouse, but in his more collected intervals spoke of the urgent necessity of a prolonged consultation with the proprietors of the storage emporium. His more fevered ramblings were profoundly unsettling indeed, including desperate entreaties that certain articles within a long-sealed wardrobe be expunged, and phantasmagorical allusions to some scheme for the eradication of all superfluous garments and every outmoded accessory from the domestic sphere by the implacable, encroaching tide of entropy and decay. He would exclaim that the domestic order was imperiled, since the elder forces of clutter wished to overwhelm it and draw it away from the realm of tidiness and the cosmos of organization into some chaotic plane or phase of existence from which it had once been wrested, countless seasons prior. At other times he would call for the dreaded compendium of domestic lore and the arcane treatise on spatial reclamation, in which he seemed hopeful of discovering some methodology to arrest the disarray he so vividly envisioned."}

Now I regret the harm I have inflicted upon these alien and incredible beings in the course of our nightly skirmishes.

It is their misfortune to have had as their human agents in Vermont some very inferior specimens\u2014the late Walter Brown, for example. He prejudiced me vastly against them. Actually, they have never knowingly harmed men, but have often been cruelly wronged and spied upon by our species. There is a whole secret cult of evil men (a man of your mystical erudition will understand me when I link them with Hastur and the Yellow Sign) devoted to the purpose of tracking them down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions. It is against these aggressors\u2014not against normal humanity\u2014that the drastic precautions of the Outer Ones are directed. Incidentally, I learned that many of our lost letters were stolen not by the Outer Ones but by the emissaries of this malign cult. All that the Outer Ones wish of man is peace and non-molestation and an increasing intellectual rapport. This latter is absolutely necessary now that our inventions and devices are expanding our knowledge and motions, and making it more and more impossible for the Outer Ones\u2019 necessary outposts to exist secretly on this planet. The alien beings desire to know mankind more fully, and to have a few of mankind\u2019s philosophic and scientific leaders know more about them. With such an exchange of knowledge all perils will pass, and a satisfactory modus vivendi be established. The very idea of any attempt to enslave or degrade mankind is ridiculous. As a beginning of this improved rapport, the Outer Ones have naturally chosen me\u2014whose knowledge of them is already so considerable\u2014as their primary interpreter on earth. Much was told me last night\u2014facts of the most stupendous and vista-opening nature\u2014and more will be subsequently communicated to me both orally and in writing."}

Nor did anythign come out from that opening to stop him. Whateevr had been made no sonud or movement. its crushing of the dropped flashlight had not been for it. Each time Willett 's fingers felt a slab with holes, he trembled. Walking over it increased the groaning. But it had no effect, since he moved. times during his journey, the light grew dimmer. He realized the candles. Lamps he had left must be going one by one. The thought of being lost in darkness without matches in this world of nightmare passages made him stand up. He could do this that he had passed the pit. He knew that once the light failed, his hope of rescue. Survival would depend on whatever search party Mr. Ward might send after he had been missing.,, he came out of the area into the hallway. He located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a moment, he reached it. Was standing in Ward 's library. He trembled with relief, watching the sputtering of that lamp which had guided him to safety., he began refilling the burned - out lamps from an oil supply he had noticed. When the room was, he looked to see if he could find a lantern for exploration. Though tormented by horror, his sense of purpose remained. He was resolved to leave no stone in his search for the facts behind Charles Ward 's madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chsoe the of the lamps to carry. He filled his pockets with candles and matches. He took a gallon can of oil, which he planned to keep in reserve for whatever hidden laboratory he might discover beyond the space with its altar. Nameless covered wells. Crossing that space would require all his courage. He knew it must be done.\n###\nAt another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it. Each time Willett\u2019s fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young Ward\u2019s secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety. In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind Charles Ward\u2019s bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done."}

I know panic would have spread if they could have shared notes. As it was, without their originla records, I pratly suspected the manager. I thought he might have asked leading questions. He might have changed the appointment books to support what he had secretly decided to see. That is why I kept feeling the new patient, smoehow aware of the old cancellations my coworker suffered, had been tricking the experienced doctor. These answers from the clinic staff told a troubling story. From the last week of February to the first of April, many of them had received very strange questions. The number of calls was far greater during the office's remodeling time. Over a fourth of those who reported anything described requests and half-spoken complaints. These were not unlike what the new person had described. Some of the appointment makers admitted sharp fear of the large, unnamed machine heard near the end of the event. One case, which the memo stresses, was very sad. The person, a well-known advisor who favored home remedies. Unusual treatments, became viloently angry on the day the yuong man's booking was confirmed. He left several months later after endelss pleas to be saved from some escaped creature of the treatment room. Had my coworker had named these clients instead of just using chrat numbers, I would have tried some checking. But as it was, I managed to find only a few. All of these, however, fully supported the records. I have often wondered if all people in the manager's survey felt as confused as this small group did. It is good that no explanation will ever reach them.\n###\nIt was from the receptionists and hygienists that the pertinent answers came, and I know that consternation would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes. As it was, lacking their original ledgers, I half suspected the manager of having posed leading questions, or of having edited the appointment logs in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see. That is why I continued to feel that the new patient, somehow cognisant of the old cancellations which my colleague had endured, had been imposing on the veteran practitioner. These responses from the clinical staff told a disturbing tale. From the last week of February to the first of April a large proportion of them had fielded very bizarre inquiries, the frequency of the calls being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the office\u2019s renovation. Over a fourth of those who reported anything, reported requests and half-uttered complaints not unlike those which the newcomer had described; and some of the schedulers confessed acute dread of the monolithic, nameless apparatus audible toward the conclusion of the ordeal. One case, which the memorandum describes with emphasis, was very lamentable. The subject, a widely known consultant with leanings toward homeopathy and unorthodox remedies, went violently irate on the date of the young man\u2019s confirmation, and departed several months later after incessant entreaties to be spared from some escaped denizen of the operatory. Had my colleague referred to these clients by name instead of merely by chart number, I should have attempted some corroboration and personal inquiry; but as it was, I succeeded in tracing down only a few. All of these, however, bore out the records in full. I have often wondered if all the objects of the administrator\u2019s survey felt as bewildered as did this fraction. It is well that no clarification shall ever reach them."}

The sculptures showed them exactly what the buildings, mountains, squares, suburbs, landscape. Rich Tertiary plants looked like. It must have had wonderful and mysterious beauty. When the observer thought of it, he almost forgot the cold feeling of evil pressure. The city's inhuman age, size, deadness, distance. Icy half-light had choked. Weighed on his spirit. But some carvings show the people of that city also felt oppressive terror. There was a dark and repeating scene type. In it, the Old Ones are shown pulling back in fear from some object. This object never appears in the design. It was found in the great river. It was shown as having been washde down through moving, vine-covered cycad forests from those terrible westward mountains.\n###\nThis river, once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges, was plainly the one whose extinct course we had seen in our a\u00ebroplane survey.

Akeley said this record was made around 1 a.m. On the first of May, 1915. It was near the closed entrance of a cave. This cave is where the wooded west side of Dark Mountain meets Lee's Swamp. The place had always had many strange voices. That is why he brought the phonograph, dictaphone, and blank record hoping for results.

The tension was aggravated by the disappearance of M\u00fcller and Zimmer, who undoubtedly committed suicide as a result of the fears which had seemed to harass them, though they were not observed in the act of jumping overboard. I was rather glad to be rid of M\u00fcller, for even his silence had unfavourably affected the crew. Everyone seemed inclined to be silent now, as though holding a secret fear. Many were ill, but none made a disturbance. Lieut. Klenze chafed under the strain, and was annoyed by the merest trifles\u2014such as the school of dolphins which gathered about the U-29 in increasing numbers, and the growing intensity of that southward current which was not on our chart."}

The magic of Nature changes the forest landscape into one bright, nearly uniform mass of green. The senses are almost drunk on the waves of moist green plants. The subtle smells of earth. In such a place, the mind loses its sense of scale. Time and space seem and unreal. Echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat constantly on the captivated mind. All day I had been wandering through the mysterious woods of the valley. I was thinking thoughts I need not discuss. I was talking with things I need not name. I was only ten years I had seen. Heard many wonders unknwon to most people. I was oddly mature in some ways. When I pushed my way between two patches of thorns, I suddenly saw the entrance to the vault. I did not know what I had found. The blocks of granite, the door held oddly open. The funeral carvings above the arch did not make me think of anything sad. I knew and imagined much about graves and tombs. Because of my unusual nature, I had never been to any churchyards. The stone house on the wooded slope only maed me curious. I tried to look inside through gap left open, but I saw nothing. Its damp interior gave me no feeling of death or decay. But in that moment of curiosity, a wild and unreasonable desire was born. This desire has brought me to this hell of confinement. Pushed on by a voice that must have come from the soul of the forest, I decided to enter the inviting darkness. I would go in despite the heavy chains blocking my way. In the fading daylight, I tried two things. I rattled the rusty chains to try and open the stone door I also tried to squeeze my body through the existing opening. Neither plan worked. At first I was curious, but now I was frantic. When I returned home in the growing twliight, I had sworn to the hundred gods of the woods. I swore that I would force my way into the black, depths that seemed to call to me, no matter the cost. The doctor with the iron-grey beard who visits me daily once told a visitor this decision was the start of a sad obsession. But I will let my readers make the final judgment after they learn everything.\n###\nIt was in mid-summer, when the alchemy of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation. In such surroundings the mind loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness. All day I had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow; thinking thoughts I need not discuss, and conversing with things I need not name. In years a child of ten, I had seen and heard many wonders unknown to the throng; and was oddly aged in certain respects. When, upon forcing my way between two savage clumps of briers, I suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault, I had no knowledge of what I had discovered. The dark blocks of granite, the door so curiously ajar, and the funereal carvings above the arch, aroused in me no associations of mournful or terrible character. Of graves and tombs I knew and imagined much, but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries. The strange stone house on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation; and its cold, damp interior, into which I vainly peered through the aperture so tantalisingly left, contained for me no hint of death or decay. But in that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has brought me to this hell of confinement. Spurred on by a voice which must have come from the hideous soul of the forest, I resolved to enter the beckoning gloom in spite of the ponderous chains which barred my passage. In the waning light of day I alternately rattled the rusty impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone door, and essayed to squeeze my slight form through the space already provided; but neither plan met with success. At first curious, I was now frantic; and when in the thickening twilight I returned to my home, I had sworn to the hundred gods of the grove that at any cost I would some day force an entrance to the black, chilly depths that seemed calling out to me. The physician with the iron-grey beard who comes each day to my room once told a visitor that this decision marked the beginning of a pitiful monomania; but I will leave final judgment to my readers when they shall have learnt all."}

This is why Kingsport people talked all spring and summer. They talked about three bodies that could not be identified. The bodies were badly cut, as if by many swords. They were badly crushde, as if by many boot heels. The tide brought the bodies in. Some people even talked about unimportant things. They talked about an car found in Ship Street.

Social rooms of Providence. I suppose you will not ask now why I must stay away from tea rooms. It was something I found on my tongue the next morning. You remember, the bitter drink made from those deep, dark beans in the kitchen. The thing I thought was just a stimulant to use instead of that weak tea.

A very frightening decision was made. Despite a conservative education. Because of it, because boring lives create wishes for the unknown, a strong promise was made. The promise was to climb that avoided north cliff. Visit the rather grey cottage in the sky. Very it is argued plausibly by the more reasonable self. It argues the place must have people living there. These people must reach it from inland along the easier ridge next to the Miskatonic river's mouth. One observes they probably traded in Arkham. They knew how Kingsport likde their home. Or maybe they could not climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. The smaller cliffs were walked along to wehre the cliff rose boldly up to meet the sky. It became very sure no human feet could go up. Down that steep south slope. East and north it rose thousands of feet straight up from the water. So only the west side, inland and toward Arkham, was left.\n###\nAt length, being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the Kingsporter\u2019s fear nor the summer boarder\u2019s usual indolence, Olney made a very terrible resolve. Despite a conservative training\u2014or because of it, for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the unknown\u2014he swore a great oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit the abnormally antique grey cottage in the sky. Very plausibly his saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people who reached it from inland along the easier ridge beside the Miskatonic\u2019s estuary. Probably they traded in Arkham, knowing how little Kingsport liked their habitation, or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. Olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things, and became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on that beetling southern slope. East and north it rose thousands of feet vertically from the water, so only the western side, inland and toward Arkham, remained."}

For an hour, in the brightest room that could be found upstairs, the doctor's frightening story was quietly todl to the surprised father. Nothing was to be told except the appearance of that shape when the greenish-black vapor from the kylix moved apart. One was too tired to ask whta had really happened. Confused head-shaking was seen from both men. Once, a quiet suggestoin was made by Mr. Ward: \"Do you think it would help to dig?\" Slience was kept by the docotr. It did not seem right for any human mind to answre. This was because powers from unknown places had seriously entered this side of the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go?

It closed the hole in some way.\" Again, silence was allowed to answer.\n###\nSo for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father.

There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed suggestion, \u201cDo you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\u201d The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the Great Abyss.

No amount of practiced calm could change the facts. The strangely textured and large linen was vrey colse to two clean surfaces. The mistress's exact note had spoken of this linen as a large collection. The housekeeper had inspected these two surfaces in her rounds. They clearly served as the altars or special places for the laundry's holy completion. The linen was persenting itself as the rebirth of an old household order. Was at least advised to demand, careful plans against a \"heap.\" This heap could hardly be anything. The unfolded abundacne. There was organized boredom happening. No matter who satrted it, the waiting cloth was now at the center of it. Therefore, thankful that the wash was now safe from the clothesline, the housekeeper acted quickly. She asked her assistants to learn all they could about the mysterious towel piles. They should find where they came from and what the cupboard knew about them. If possible, they should discover their intended arrangement. Supplying the womne with one of the linen-lcoset keys the mistress gave up, she urged them to explore the empty folding-table. This table had been identified when the laundry's loads were put down. They should get any clues thye could from any creases they might have left around. The housekeeper talked with the assistants in the laundry's old side room. They felt clear unease when they finally left it. A vague feeling of mnootony seemed to hang about the place. Perhaps it was what they had heard about the infamous old routine. Its ghost had once ruled from the shelved corners. Perhaps it was something different and unrelated. But in any case, they all partly sensed an invisible bad feeling. This feeling centered on that carved leftover of an older household duty. At times it almost rose to the strength of a physical presence.\n###\nBut if Mrs. Henderson and the housekeeper refrained from shewing this directive to the domestics, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of practiced indifference could controvert the fact that the strangely textured and voluminous linen, of which the mistress\u2019s precise memorandum had spoken as such a formidable accumulation, was in close and inexorable proximity to two immaculate surfaces which the housekeeper had inspected in her rounds and which plainly served as the altars or tabernacles for the laundry\u2019s hallowed completion; that it was presenting itself as the reincarnation of an ancient domestic order, and that it demanded\u2014or was at least advised to demand\u2014meticulous designs against a \u201cheap\u201d which could scarcely be other than the unfolded bounty. There was organised tedium afoot; and no matter who had initiated it, the awaiting cloth was by this time at the centre of it. Therefore, thanking providence that the wash was now safe from the line, the housekeeper lost no time in engaging her assistants to learn all they could of the cryptic terry piles; finding whence they had come and what the cupboard knew of them, and if possible discovering their destined arrangement. Supplying the women with one of the linen-closet keys which the mistress yielded up, she urged them to explore the vacant folding-table which had been identified when the laundry\u2019s burdens had been deposited; obtaining what clues they could from any creases they might have left about. The housekeeper talked with the assistants in the laundry\u2019s old annex, and they felt a marked unease when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of monotony. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old routine whose ghost had once presided from the shelved recesses, and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older household duty and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation."}

A of the stories had links with legends of the world before humans, those Hindoo tales involving lengths of time. Forming part of the knowledge of theosophists. belief agreed in their idea that mankind is oneof the. Ruling races of this planet 's. history. Things of shapes beyond thought, they suggested, had built towers to the sky. Dug into every secret of Nature before the amphibian ancestor of man had crawled out of the sea three hundred million years. Some had come down from the stars. A were as the universe itself. Others had risen from earth germs bheind the germs of our life cycle as those germs are behind us. Spans of thousands of millions of years. Links with galaxies. Universes, were talked about., there was no thing as time in its accepted sense. But tales and feelings were about a race. It was of a and shape like no life form known to science. It had lived until fifty million years before the coming of man. This, they said, was the race of all because it had learned the secret of time. It had learned all things that were known. would be known on earth. It did this thorugh the power of its minds to throw themselves into the past. Future, across gaps of millions of years. Study the knowledge of every age. From the deeds of this race came all stories of prophets, including those in mythology. In its libraries were books of texts. Pictures hodling the whole of earth 's records \u2014 histories. Descriptions of eevry species that had been. That would be. These had records of their arts, tehir achievements, their languages, and their psychologies. With this age - spanning knowledge, the Great Race chose from every time. Life form thoughts, arts. Methods as might fit its nature. Knowledge of the past, got through a kind of mind sending outside the senses, was to gather than knowledge of the future.\n###\nWas it not natural, then, for my subsequent dreams and emotional impressions to become coloured and moulded by what my memory subtly held over from my secondary state? A few of the myths had significant connexions with other cloudy legends of the pre-human world, especially those Hindoo tales involving stupefying gulfs of time and forming part of the lore of modern theosophists. Primal myth and modern delusion joined in their assumption that mankind is only one\u2014perhaps the least\u2014of the highly evolved and dominant races of this planet\u2019s long and largely unknown career. Things of inconceivable shape, they implied, had reared towers to the sky and delved into every secret of Nature before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled out of the hot sea three hundred million years ago. Some had come down from the stars; a few were as old as the cosmos itself; others had arisen swiftly from terrene germs as far behind the first germs of our life-cycle as those germs are behind ourselves. Spans of thousands of millions of years, and linkages with other galaxies and universes, were freely spoken of. Indeed, there was no such thing as time in its humanly accepted sense. But most of the tales and impressions concerned a relatively late race, of a queer and intricate shape resembling no life-form known to science, which had lived till only fifty million years before the advent of man. This, they indicated, was the greatest race of all; because it alone had conquered the secret of time. It had learned all things that ever were known or ever would be known on the earth, through the power of its keener minds to project themselves into the past and future, even through gulfs of millions of years, and study the lore of every age. From the accomplishments of this race arose all legends of prophets, including those in human mythology. In its vast libraries were volumes of texts and pictures holding the whole of earth\u2019s annals\u2014histories and descriptions of every species that had ever been or that ever would be, with full records of their arts, their achievements, their languages, and their psychologies. With this aeon-embracing knowledge, the Great Race chose from every era and life-form such thoughts, arts, and processes as might suit its own nature and situation. Knowledge of the past, secured through a kind of mind-casting outside the recognised senses, was harder to glean than knowledge of the future."}

Soon after his daughter was born, it is recorded that Curwen decided to have his portrait painted. He seemed unusually happy about the birth, which was not like his normal self. A very talented Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander painted it. Cosmo Alexander lived in Newport at the time. He later became famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The portrait was painted on a wooden panel in the library of the house in Olney Court. Two diaires mention the portrait. But neither gives any clue about what finally happened to it. During this time, it is noted that the unpredictable scholar showed signs of beign very distracted. He spent as much time as possible at his farm on Pawtuxet Road. He semeed to be in a state of hidden excitement or waiting. It was as if he expected something amazing or was close to a discovery. Chemistry or alchemy seemed very important. It is observed that he took most of his books on that subject from his house to the farm.\n###\nShortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject."}

For many months after that, we looked for wonderful city of Celepha\u00efs. Its galleys that go to the sky. We did not find them. Our dreams took us to many beautiful and unknown places. But no one we met could tell us how to find Ooth-Nargai, beyond the Tanarian Hills. One night we flwe over dark mountains. There were faint, lonely campfires far apart. There were strange, hairy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders. In the wildest part of this hilly country, very few people could have seen it. We found a very old stone wall or causeway. It zigzagged along the ridges and valleys. It was too huge to have been built by human hands. It was so long that neither end could be seen. Beyond that wall in the gray dawn, we came to a land of odd gardens. When the sun rose, we saw great beauty. There were red. White flowers, green leaves. Lawns, white paths, sparkling brooks, small blue lakes, carved bridges. For a moment we forgot Celepha\u00efs because we were so happy. We remembered it again when we traveled down a white path toward a red-roofed pagoda. We would have aksed the people of that lnad about it. But we found there were no people there. There were only birds, bees, and butterflies. On another night we walked up a damp stone spiral staircase for a very long time. We came to a tower window. It overlooked a large plain and a rievr lit by the full moon. In the silent city that spread from the riverbank, we thought we saw some feature. Layout we had known before. We would have gone down and asked the way to Ooth-Nargai. But scary aurora flashed up from a far place beyond the horizon. It showed the ruin and old age of the city. It showed the still, reedy river. It showed the death lying on that land. That death had been there since King Kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the gods' punishment.\n###\nFor many months after that Kuranes sought the marvellous city of Celepha\u00efs and its sky-bound galleys in vain; and though his dreams carried him to many gorgeous and unheard-of places, no one whom he met could tell him how to find Ooth-Nargai, beyond the Tanarian Hills. One night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint, lone campfires at great distances apart, and strange, shaggy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders; and in the wildest part of this hilly country, so remote that few men could ever have seen it, he found a hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges and valleys; too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands, and of such a length that neither end of it could be seen. Beyond that wall in the grey dawn he came to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees, and when the sun rose he beheld such beauty of red and white flowers, green foliage and lawns, white paths, diamond brooks, blue lakelets, carven bridges, and red-roofed pagodas, that he for a moment forgot Celepha\u00efs in sheer delight. But he remembered it again when he walked down a white path toward a red-roofed pagoda, and would have questioned the people of that land about it, had he not found that there were no people there, but only birds and bees and butterflies. On another night Kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly, and came to a tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon; and in the silent city that spread away from the river-bank he thought he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before. He would have descended and asked the way to Ooth-Nargai had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon, shewing the ruin and antiquity of the city, and the stagnation of the reedy river, and the death lying upon that land, as it had lain since King Kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the gods."}

It was in a dee,p wet hole. It had thick grass, moss, and strange weeds. There was a bad smell that idle thuoght might foolishly link to rotting stone. Everywhere showed neglect and decay. It seemed as if the first living things had broken a deadly silence of hundreds of years. Over the valley's edge, a pale, thin moon looked through bad air that seemed to come from unknown tombs. By its waek, moving light, one could see many old grave markers, urns, monuments. All were broken, covered in moss, stained by damp. Partly hidden by thick, sickly plants. The first clear memory of being in this terrible place is stopping before a worn-down grave. Putting down things that seemed to have been carried. It is noted that an electric lantern and two spades were there. The companion had a similar lantern and a portable telephone. No one spoke. The place and job seemed known. Right away, the spades were taken to begin clearing grass, weeds. Dirt from the flat, ancient tomb. After showing whole surface, which was three big granite slabs, they stepped back to look at the burial place. Mental calculations seemed to be made. Then they returned to the grave. Using a spade as a tool, tehy tried to lift slab nearest to a stone ruin that might have been a mounment. Success was not achieved. A signal was made for help. Finally, combined strength moved the stone. It was lifted and turned to one side.\n###\nThe place was an ancient cemetery; so ancient that I trembled at the manifold signs of immemorial years. It was in a deep, damp hollow, overgrown with rank grass, moss, and curious creeping weeds, and filled with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with rotting stone. On every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude, and I seemed haunted by the notion that Warren and I were the first living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries. Over the valley\u2019s rim a wan, waning crescent moon peered through the noisome vapours that seemed to emanate from unheard-of catacombs, and by its feeble, wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs, urns, cenotaphs, and mausolean facades; all crumbling, moss-grown, and moisture-stained, and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation. My first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible necropolis concerns the act of pausing with Warren before a certain half-obliterated sepulchre, and of throwing down some burdens which we seemed to have been carrying. I now observed that I had with me an electric lantern and two spades, whilst my companion was supplied with a similar lantern and a portable telephone outfit. No word was uttered, for the spot and the task seemed known to us; and without delay we seized our spades and commenced to clear away the grass, weeds, and drifted earth from the flat, archaic mortuary. After uncovering the entire surface, which consisted of three immense granite slabs, we stepped back some distance to survey the charnel scene; and Warren appeared to make some mental calculations. Then he returned to the sepulchre, and using his spade as a lever, sought to pry up the slab lying nearest to a stony ruin which may have been a monument in its day. He did not succeed, and motioned to me to come to his assistance. Finally our combined strength loosened the stone, which we raised and tipped to one side."}

He got off chair. He started moving toward me. He had a smile on his face with lips. I felt I was in danger. I took out the ray - projector to defend myself. I do not know why I thought it could help me. I turned it on. I aimed it at his face. I saw his skin shine violet and pink. His look of joy started to change. A look of fear appeared. But the joy did not go. He stopped walking. he waved his arms in the air. He began to stumble. I saw he was moving toward the stairwell in the floor. I tried to shout a warning. He did not hear me. A moment he fell through the opening. He disappeared from sight. I had trouble moving to the stairwell. When I got, I saw no body on the floor. I heard the sound of people coming up with lanterns. The spell of silence was broken. I could hear sounds and see people three - shapes. Something had brought a crowd to this place. Had there been a noise I did not hear? the two people saw me. They were villagers, it seemed. They stood. One of them screamed. The sound echoed. they all turned and ran in panic. All but one person ran. When the crowd was gone, I saw the man with the beard. He was the one who brought me. He stood with a lantern. He looked at me, gasping and. He did not seem. he started to climb the stairs. He joined me in the attic. He spoke. \" you did not leave it! I am. I know what has happened. It happened. That man got and shot himself. You should not have made him come. You know what he wants. But you must not get like that man he scared. Somtehing and has happened to you. But it did not go to damage your mind and who you are. If you stay. Accept that you need to make some changes in your life, you can continue to enjoy the world. You can enjoy the results of your studies.\n###\nHe slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark, thin-lipped face. I felt somehow in deadly peril, and drew out the peculiar ray-projector as a weapon of defence. Why I thought it could help me, I do not know. I turned it on\u2014full in his face, and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light. His expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear\u2014which did not, however, wholly displace the exultation. He stopped in his tracks\u2014then, flailing his arms wildly in the air, began to stagger backward. I saw he was edging toward the open stair-well in the floor, and tried to shout a warning, but he did not hear me. In another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to view. I found difficulty in moving toward the stair-well, but when I did get there I found no crushed body on the floor below. Instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns, for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken, and I once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally tri-dimensional. Something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place. Had there been a noise I had not heard? Presently the two people (simply villagers, apparently) farthest in the lead saw me\u2014and stood paralysed. One of them shrieked loudly and reverberently: Then they all turned and fled frantically. All, that is, but one. When the crowd was gone I saw the grave-bearded man who had brought me to this place\u2014standing alone with a lantern. He was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly, but did not seem afraid. Then he began to ascend the stairs, and joined me in the attic. He spoke: \u201cSo you didn\u2019t let it alone! I\u2019m sorry. I know what has happened. It happened once before, but the man got frightened and shot himself. You ought not to have made him come back. You know what he wants. But you mustn\u2019t get frightened like the other man he got. Something very strange and terrible has happened to you, but it didn\u2019t get far enough to hurt your mind and personality. If you\u2019ll keep cool, and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life, you can keep right on enjoying the world, and the fruits of your scholarship."}

The gray changes to a pink with gold edges. A moaning sound is heard. A sandstorm is seen moving among the stones. The sky is clear and the desert remains calm. Then suddenly the bright edge of the sun appears over the far edge of the desert. It is seen through the sandstorm that is edning. In an excited state, it is imagined that sound of musical metal comes from a place. It greets the sun like Memnon greets it from the banks of the Nile. The ears ring.

My ears rang and my imagination seethed as I led my camel slowly across the sand to that unvocal stone place; that place too old for Egypt and Mero\u00eb to remember; that place which I alone of living men had seen."}

What we learned and saw in those hours of sinful exploration can never be told. No language has the symbols or words for it. We say this because from start to finish our discoveries were only sensations. These sensations did not match any impression that a normal human nervous system can receive. They were sensations. But they contained unbelievable parts of time and space. These are things that do not really have a clear and definite existence. Human speaking can best describe the general feel of our experiences. They can be called plungings or soarings. In every moment of discovery, part of our minds broke away from all that is real. It rushed through the air along shocking, dark, and fear-filled depths. It sometimes tore through certain clear and typical obstacles. These can only be described as thick, awkward clouds or vapors. In these black and bodiless flights, we were sometimes alone and sometimes together. Wehn we were together, our friend was always far ahead. We could understand his presence even without a body. This was through a kind of picture memory. His face appeared to us, golden from a strange light. It was frightful with its odd beauty, its strangely young cheeks, its burning eyes, its Olympian brow.

On the other hand, there were many pages of symbols and formulas. There were also historical notes and philosophical comments. The handwriting was cramped. It looked excatly like the ancient scritp of Joseph Curwen. However, it was clearly written in modern times. Plainly had been part of a recent project. This project involved carefully copying the old wizard's writing style. Charles seemed to have perfected this imitation to an amazing degree. There was no sign of a third person's handwriting, which might have been Allen's. If Allen had truly become the leader, he must have made young Ward write everything down for him. In tihs new material, one mystical formula appeared again and aagin. Actually, it was a pair of formulas. It appeared so often that Willett memorized it before he was halfway through his search. It had two side-by-side columns. left column had the old symbol called \"Dragon's Head\" at the top. This symbol is used in almanacs to show the ascending node. The right column had a matching symbol for \"Dragon's Tail\". The descending node at the top. The whole thing looked something like this. Almost without thinking, the doctor realized the second half was jsut the first half written backward syllable by syllable. The only exceptions were the final single syllables and the strange name Yog-Sothoth. He had learned to recognize this name under different spellings from other things he had seen related to this horrible affair. The formulas were as follows. They were exactly as shown, and Willett can fully confirm this. The first formula stirred a strange feeling of uncomfortable, hidden memory in his mind. He recognized this feeling later when he thought back on the events of that terrible Good Friday from the year before. These formulas were very haunting. He found them very often. Before the doctor knew it, he was whispering them to himself. He felt he had collected all the papers he could usefully study for no.w Therefore, he decided not to examine any more until he could bring the skeptical mental health experts together for a larger, more organized search. He still needed to find the hidden laboratory. So he left his suitcase in the lit room. He wetn back out into the black, foul-smelling hallway. The arched ceiling echoed constantly with a dull, horrible whining sound. The next few rooms he checked were all empty. Or they were only filled with rotting boxes and scary-looking lead coffins. But tehy made him deeply aware of the huge scale of Joseph Curwen's orignial activities.\n###\nOn the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard\u2019s writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allen\u2019s there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis. In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \u201cDragon\u2019s Head\u201d and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \u201cDragon\u2019s Tail\u201d or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows\u2014exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify\u2014and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year. So haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whine. The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwen\u2019s original operations."}

He saw that other people were there before us. We heard the sound of burglar alarm still ringing from the library. An open window looked black and in the moonlight. What had arrived had indeed finished entering. Srceaming, now quickly becoming a mixed growling. Moaning, clearly came from inside. Some instinct warned Armitage that waht was happening was not for unprepared eyes to see. So he pushed the crowd back with authority as he unlocked the entrance door. Amogn the others, we saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan. We had told these two men some of our guesses and worries. He signaled for these two to come inside with us. The sounds inside, except for a watchful, continuous whine from the dog, had moslty stopped by now.

It was as if they were in time with the last breaths of a dying man.\n###\nArmitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library. An open window shewed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a watchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided; but Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping, as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying man."}

Williams was a dreamre. He was only twenty-three. When people entered the old house, they felt something strange. They felt a cosmic wind around the thin, old man in the next room. Friendship was forced where old friends did not dare force theirs. People marveled at the fear that was on this thin, tired man who watched. No one could doubt that the man always watched and listened. It was seen that he watched. Listened more with his mind than with his eyes. He tried every moment to drown something by reading happy, boring novels without stopping. When the church bells rang, it was seen that he would cover his ears. The grey cat that lived with him would howl together until the last bell sound faded away.\n###\nWilliams was a dreamer, and only twenty-three, and when he moved into the ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic wind about the grey wizened man in the next room.

It had spread completely like a vapor through four connecting rooms. It was a sharp and unsettling antiseptic smell. It hung heavily in the hallways and entryways. It stayed with the visitors during all their uncomfortable wiats. In that place, one would breathe cautiously the odd chemical. Floral notes from the air freshener's release. The orderlies would polish and examine things through long, quiet afternoons. By then, the cleaning of the area was finished. Those who experienced it wondered why one of the air vents had been turned into a sealed mteal opening. It was a vent in the back of the eastern waiting wing, very close to the pharmacy. No one could guess why a segmented plastic duct was put in, leading from it to the outside walls. Around the time this work was finished, people noticed old linen closet was abandoned again. It had been tightly locked and without windows since the renovation started. The door swung open lazily. Once, a certain visitor looked inside after a call with the head doctor. He was very unsettled by the unique smell he met. He said it was a scent he had never smelled before in his life, except near the botanical gardens in the city park. He felt it could not come from anything ordinayr or of this normal world. Then, the halls. Rooms of medical places have never been known for having a neutral smell.\n###\nWhen the sanitization was complete and the hour had struck three\u2014in the November of that year\u2014its potency and pervasiveness were almost unnerving. It had spread as thoroughly as a vapour through four contiguous chambers, and was a sharp and unnervingly antiseptic emanation. It hung oppressively within the corridors and vestibules, and accompanied the visitors on all their uneasy vigils. In that place one would breathe warily the queer chemical and floral notes in the air-freshener\u2019s discharge, while the orderlies would polish and scrutinise through long, hushed afternoons. By this time the purification of the area was finished, and those who endured it wondered why one of the ventilation grilles had been made into a sealed metallic aperture. It was a grille in the rear of the eastern waiting wing, close against the pharmacy; and no one could imagine why a segmented plastic duct was installed leading from it to the outer walls. About the period of this work\u2019s completion people noticed that the old linen closet, tightly locked and windowlessly panelled since the renovation\u2019s commencement, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when a certain visitor once peered within after a consultation call on the head physician he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered\u2014such a fragrance, he averred, as he had never before inhaled in all his days except near the botanical gardens in the municipal park, and which could not come from anything mundane or of this wholesome realm. But then, the halls and chambers of healing institutions have never been remarkable for olfactory neutrality."}

I will throw myself form this window into the srteet.\n###\nThe box, whose fastenings were broken by the stroke which had unearthed it, contained many papers and objects of value; but I had eyes for one thing alone. It was the porcelain miniature of a young man in a smartly curled bag-wig, and bore the initials \u201cJ. H.\u201d The face was such that as I gazed, I might well have been studying my mirror. On the following day I was brought to this room with the barred windows, but I have been kept informed of certain things through an aged and simple-minded servitor, for whom I bore a fondness in infancy, and who like me loves the churchyard. What I have dared relate of my experiences within the vault has brought me only pitying smiles. My father, who visits me frequently, declares that at no time did I pass the chained portal, and swears that the rusted padlock had not been touched for fifty years when he examined it. He even says that all the village knew of my journeys to the tomb, and that I was often watched as I slept in the bower outside the grim facade, my half-open eyes fixed on the crevice that leads to the interior. Against these assertions I have no tangible proof to offer, since my key to the padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of horrors. The strange things of the past which I learnt during those nocturnal meetings with the dead he dismisses as the fruits of my lifelong and omnivorous browsing amongst the ancient volumes of the family library. Had it not been for my old servant Hiram, I should have by this time become quite convinced of my madness. But Hiram, loyal to the last, has held faith in me, and has done that which impels me to make public at least a part of my story. A week ago he burst open the lock which chains the door of the tomb perpetually ajar, and descended with a lantern into the murky depths. On a slab in an alcove he found an old but empty coffin whose tarnished plate bears the single word \u201cJervas\u201d. In that coffin and in that vault they have promised me I shall be buried. I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below."}

I didn\u2019t keep track of the cross streets, and can\u2019t tell you yet which it was we turned up, but I know it wasn\u2019t Greenough Lane. When we did turn, it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and dirtiest alley I ever saw in my life, with crumbling-looking gables, broken small-paned windows, and archaic chimneys that stood out half-disintegrated against the moonlit sky.

The floor was covered with, boxes and barrels. The place looked. But I did not care about that feeling. I went toward the staicrase. My flashlight showed the staircase. I looked at my watch. It showed the time was 2 a.m. The steps made noise when I stepped on them. But they seemed. I ran down past a floor that looked like a barn. I went to the ground floor. The place was. echoes answered my footsteps. I reached the hall. At one end I saw a, glowing rectangle. It marked the Paine Street doorway. Headign the direction, I found the door was. I rushed out and went fiev stone steps. I reached the courtyard. The courtyard had grass growing between the cobblestones. The moonlight did not reach. But I could see to move without using the flashlight. Some windows on the Gilman House side were giving off a glow. I thought I heard sounds from. Walking I moved to the Washington Street side. I saw doorways. I chose the one as my way. The hallway was. When I reached the end, I saw the street door was stuck. It would not move. Resolved I decided to try another building. I felt my way toward the courtyard. But I stopped when I was near the doorway. Because from an opened door in the Gilman House, a crowd of shapes was coming out. Lanterns weer moving and in the darkness., voices were making cries. They were not speaking English. The figures moved in an way. I realized with relief that they did not know where I had gone. But, they made me with horror. I could not see their faces. But their bent - ove,r shuffling walk was and. of all, I saw that one figure wore a robe. On its head was a tiara. The design of the tiara was to me. As the figures spread out across the courtyard, I felt. Suppose What if I could not find a way out of this building on the street side? The smell was. I was I could stand it without fainting. I felt my way toward the street. I opened a door off the hall. I entered an room. The room had windows that were but had no sashes.\n###\nThe distance was slight, however, so I clambered over the brink and dropped; striking a dusty floor littered with crumbling boxes and barrels. The place was ghoulish-looking, but I was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlight\u2014after a hasty glance at my watch, which shewed the hour to be 2 a.m. The steps creaked, but seemed tolerably sound; and I raced down past a barn-like second story to the ground floor. The desolation was complete, and only echoes answered my footfalls. At length I reached the lower hall, at one end of which I saw a faint luminous rectangle marking the ruined Paine Street doorway. Heading the other way, I found the back door also open; and darted out and down five stone steps to the grass-grown cobblestones of the courtyard. The moonbeams did not reach down here, but I could just see my way about without using the flashlight. Some of the windows on the Gilman House side were faintly glowing, and I thought I heard confused sounds within. Walking softly over to the Washington Street side I perceived several open doorways, and chose the nearest as my route out. The hallway inside was black, and when I reached the opposite end I saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut. Resolved to try another building, I groped my way back toward the courtyard, but stopped short when close to the doorway. For out of an opened door in the Gilman House a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouring\u2014lanterns bobbing in the darkness, and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not English. The figures moved uncertainly, and I realised to my relief that they did not know where I had gone; but for all that they sent a shiver of horror through my frame. Their features were indistinguishable, but their crouching, shambling gait was abominably repellent. And worst of all, I perceived that one figure was strangely robed, and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar. As the figures spread throughout the courtyard, I felt my fears increase. Suppose I could find no egress from this building on the street side? The fishy odour was detestable, and I wondered I could stand it without fainting. Again groping toward the street, I opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows."}

We shone lights on the walls to see if any changes appeared. Nothing of that kind was noticed. The carvings were because of the openings of side tunnels with floors. Heard penguins. We thought we sensed a hint of a - off chorus of them. smell was. We could detect any trace of that scent. Puffs of steam showed growing differences in temperature. The closeness of the sunless sea cliffs of the abyss.,, we saw some blockages on the floor aheaadnd we turned on our flashlight after checking that the objects were., I have reached a place where it is to go on. I should be toughened by. There are some experiences. Hints that cut to allow healing. Leave such an increased sensitivity that memory brings all the terror. We saw, as I have said, some blockages on the floor. I can add that our noses were hit at the time by a strengthening of the stench, mixed with the smell of those others that had gone before us. light of the flashlight left no doubt about what the blockages were. We dared to go near them because we could see, from, that they were beyond any power to harm as had been the six samples dug up from the star - shaped graves at Lake \u2019s camp. They were,, as lacking in wholeness as of those we had dug up \u2014 though it became from the, - pool forming around them that their incompleteness was of time. There seemed to be four of them. Lake \u2019s reports would have indicated at eight as making up the group that had come before us. To find them in this condition was. We wondered what kind of fight had happened down in the dark. Penguins, attacked, fight with their beaks. And our ears conifrmed the presence of a breeding colony.\n###\nSince we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study, we resumed our advance after a cursory look; though frequently casting beams over the walls to see if any further decorative changes developed. Nothing of the sort was perceived, though the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the numerous mouths of smooth-floored lateral tunnels. We saw and heard fewer penguins, but thought we caught a vague suspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth. The new and inexplicable odour was abominably strong, and we could detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent. Puffs of visible vapour ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in temperature, and the relative nearness of the sunless sea-cliffs of the great abyss. Then, quite unexpectedly, we saw certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead\u2014obstructions which were quite definitely not penguins\u2014and turned on our second torch after making sure that the objects were quite stationary. Still another time have I come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed. I ought to be hardened by this stage; but there are some experiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing, and leave only such an added sensitiveness that memory reinspires all the original horror. We saw, as I have said, certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead; and I may add that our nostrils were assailed almost simultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange prevailing foetor, now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of those others which had gone before us. The light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions were, and we dared approach them only because we could see, even from a distance, that they were quite as past all harming power as had been the six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous star-mounded graves at poor Lake\u2019s camp. They were, indeed, as lacking in completeness as most of those we had unearthed\u2014though it grew plain from the thick, dark-green pool gathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely greater recency. There seemed to be only four of them, whereas Lake\u2019s bulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the group which had preceded us. To find them in this state was wholly unexpected, and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had occurred down here in the dark. Penguins, attacked in a body, retaliate savagely with their beaks; and our ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond."}

He staggered a step toward the table. I was steadying myself on its edge. The curtains were clutched in his hand. His hand clawed out at me. The curtains grew. They fell down from their fastenings. This let a flood of that moonlight into the room. The brightening sky had predicted this moon. In those beams, the candlse grew. A appearance of decay sperad over the room.

His fright, turning to steely despair, left room for a resurgence of his rage against me; and he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge I was steadying myself. The curtains, still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me, grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings; admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had presaged. In those greenish beams the candles paled, and a new semblance of decay spread over the musk-reeking room with its wormy panelling, sagging floor, battered mantel, rickety furniture, and ragged draperies. It spread over the old man, too, whether from the same source or because of his fear and vehemence, and I saw him shrivel and blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons. Only his eyes stayed whole, and they glared with a propulsive, dilated incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindled. The rapping was now repeated with greater insistence, and this time bore a hint of metal. The black thing facing me had become only a head with eyes, impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my direction, and occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal malice. Now swift and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels, and I saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood. I did not move, for I could not; but watched dazedly as the door fell in pieces to admit a colossal, shapeless influx of inky substance starred with shining, malevolent eyes. It poured thickly, like a flood of oil bursting a rotten bulkhead, overturned a chair as it spread, and finally flowed under the table and across the room to where the blackened head with the eyes still glared at me. Around that head it closed, totally swallowing it up, and in another moment it had begun to recede; bearing away its invisible burden without touching me, and flowing again out of that black doorway and down the unseen stairs, which creaked as before, though in reverse order. Then the floor gave way at last, and I slid gaspingly down into the nighted chamber below, choking with cobwebs and half swooning with terror."}

The gloomy, odd - eyed Martenses, whose dirty [THING] look shocked him, told him in rough, broken speech that Jan was dead. They said he was hit by lightning the previous autumn. He was now buried behind the ignored sunken gardens. They showed the visitor the grave. It was bare and had no markers. Something in the Martenses ' way gave Gifford a feeling of disgust and doubt. A week later he returned with a shovel and pick to check the burial place. He found what he expected: a skull badly crushed as if by violent blows. So he went back to Albany and openly accused the Martenses of killing their relative. Legal proof was missing, but the story spraed fast around the countryside. From then on, the Martenses were shunned by everyone. No one would do business with them. Their remote manor was avoided as a cursed place. Somehow they managed to live independently from their land 's produce. Occasional lights seen from far - off hills proved they were still there. These lights were seen as late as 1810. Near the end they became very rare. Meanwhile, many evli legends grew about the mansion and the [THING]. The place was avoided with extra care and given every whispered myth tradition could offer. It stayed unvisited until 1816, when the continued lack of lights was noticed by the squatters. Then a group investigated, finding the [THING] empty and partly ruined. There were no skeletons around, so they thought the clan had left, not died. The clan seemed to have left several years earlier. Makeshift shelters showed how large it had grown before moving. Its cultural level had fallen very low, shown by rotting furniture. Scattered silverware that must have been left long before the owners departed. But though the feared Martenses were gone, fear of the haunted [THING] continued. It grew very sharp when new strange stories arose among the [TIHNG] 's declining [THING]. There it stood: empty, feared, and linked to the vengeful ghost of Jan Martense. There it sitll stood the night I dug in Jan Martense 's grave. I have called my long digging foolish, and it truly was in goal and method. Jan Martense 's coffin was soon dug upbut in my rage to dig up his ghost, I dug irrationally. Clumsily down below where he had lain.\n###\nHis diary states that he reached Tempest Mountain on September 20, finding the mansion in great decrepitude. The sullen, odd-eyed Martenses, whose unclean animal aspect shocked him, told him in broken gutturals that Jan was dead. He had, they insisted, been struck by lightning the autumn before; and now lay buried behind the neglected sunken gardens. They shewed the visitor the grave, barren and devoid of markers. Something in the Martenses\u2019 manner gave Gifford a feeling of repulsion and suspicion, and a week later he returned with spade and mattock to explore the sepulchral spot. He found what he expected\u2014a skull crushed cruelly as if by savage blows\u2014so returning to Albany he openly charged the Martenses with the murder of their kinsman. Legal evidence was lacking, but the story spread rapidly round the countryside; and from that time the Martenses were ostracised by the world. No one would deal with them, and their distant manor was shunned as an accursed place. Somehow they managed to live on independently by the products of their estate, for occasional lights glimpsed from far-away hills attested their continued presence. These lights were seen as late as 1810, but toward the last they became very infrequent. Meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of diabolic legendry. The place was avoided with doubled assiduousness, and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply. It remained unvisited till 1816, when the continued absence of lights was noticed by the squatters. At that time a party made investigations, finding the house deserted and partly in ruins. There were no skeletons about, so that departure rather than death was inferred. The clan seemed to have left several years before, and improvised penthouses shewed how numerous it had grown prior to its migration. Its cultural level had fallen very low, as proved by decaying furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long abandoned when its owners left. But though the dreaded Martenses were gone, the fear of the haunted house continued; and grew very acute when new and strange stories arose among the mountain decadents. There it stood; deserted, feared, and linked with the vengeful ghost of Jan Martense. There it still stood on the night I dug in Jan Martense\u2019s grave. I have described my protracted digging as idiotic, and such it indeed was in object and method. The coffin of Jan Martense had soon been unearthed\u2014it now held only dust and nitre\u2014but in my fury to exhume his ghost I delved irrationally and clumsily down beneath where he had lain."}

That was the end of the voluntary searches in dream caves. Serious, the friend who had been beyond the barrier warned that one must never go into those places again. What had been seen was not to be told. From his wisdom, it was said that one must sleep as little as possible, even if drgus were needed to stay awake. That he was right was soon learned from the terrible fear that filled one whenever consciousness lapsed. After each short and unavoidable sleep, it seemed one had grown odler. The friend aged very quickly, which was almost shocking. It is awful to see wrinkles form and hair turn white almost before your eyes. The way of life was now compeltely changed. Heretofore a recluse as far as is knownthe friend now became frantic in his fear of being alone. At night he would not be by himself. The company of a few people would not calm him either. His only relief came from loud and wild parties. So they went to almost all gatherings of young and lively people. Their appearance and age seemed to cause ridicule in most cases. This was strongly disliked. The friend thought it was a smaller problem than being alone. Especially was he afraid to be outside alone when the stars were out. If forced into this situation, he would often look secretly at the sky as if chased by some monster there. He did not always look at the same place in the sky. It seemed to be a different place at different times. On spring evenings, it would be low in the northeast. In summer, it would be almost overhead. In autumn, it would be in the northwest. In winter, it would be in the east, mostly in early morning hours. Midwinter evenings seemed least scary to him. Only after two years was this fear linkde to anything specific. Thne it began to be seen he must be looking at a special spot in the sky. Its position at different times matched the direction of his look. Thsi spot was roughly marked by the constellation Corona Borealis.\n###\nThat was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream. Awed, shaken, and portentous, my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again. What he had seen, he dared not tell me; but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible, even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake. That he was right, I soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed. After each short and inevitable sleep I seemed older, whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking. It is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair whiten almost before one\u2019s eyes. Our mode of life was now totally altered. Heretofore a recluse so far as I know\u2014his true name and origin never having passed his lips\u2014my friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude. At night he would not be alone, nor would the company of a few persons calm him. His sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort; so that few assemblies of the young and the gay were unknown to us. Our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which I keenly resented, but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude. Especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining, and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein. He did not always glance at the same place in the sky\u2014it seemed to be a different place at different times. On spring evenings it would be low in the northeast. In the summer it would be nearly overhead. In the autumn it would be in the northwest. In winter it would be in the east, but mostly if in the small hours of morning. Midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him.

It had shkay houses, broken windows above doors, falling steps, twisted railings, faces. He would wind from South Main to South Water. He looked for the docks where bay and sound steamers still stopped. He returned north at this lower level. He psased the steep-roofed warehouses from 1816 and the square at Brigde. The 1773 Market House still stands strong on its arches there. In that square, it is ntoed he would stop to enjoy the confusing beauty of the town. It rises on the eastward bluff. It has two Georgian spires and is topped by the huge Christian Science dome. This is like London being topped by St. Paul's. It is clear he preferred to get to this point in the late afternoon. Then, the sunlight turns the Market House, the hill roofs, and bell towers gold. It makes the wharves magical, where Providence Indiamen used to anchor. After looking a time, he would become almost dizzy with a poet's love for the view. Then he would climb the slope home in the dusk. He passed the white church and wnet up the steep paths. Yellow lights began to show in small-paned windows. They also showed through fanlights set over double sets of steps with wrought-iron railings.\n###\nSometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Paul\u2019s. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poet\u2019s love for the sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings."}

That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness?

Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man\u2014if man it were\u2014over the telephone!

It happened because the man he worked for joined. He was the key helper of the faomus Boston surgical expert, Dr. Herbert West. Dr. West is known to have really wanted a chance to work as a surgeon in a war. When the chance came, the dcotor was taken along almost against his will.

Then a feeling of importance comes through the shining arch ahead. All the winds and scary things move away like night creatures leave before the morning. Trembling in waves that golden bits of nebula make strangely visible, a shy sign of distant music rises. It hums in chords that our own star universe does not know. As that music gets louder, the shantak is seen to lift its ears. Move forward quickly. One also leans down to hear each part. It is a song, but not from any voice. Night and the spheres are heard singing it. It is known to have been when space. The Other Gods were born.\n###\nThen through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent, and all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the dawn. Trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible, there rose a timid hint of far-off melody, droning in faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not. And as that music grew, the shantak raised its ears and plunged ahead, and Carter likewise bent to catch each lovely strain. It was a song, but not the song of any voice.

Dr. West had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war, and when the chance had come he carried me with him almost against my will. There were reasons why I would have been glad to let the war separate us; reasons why I found the practice of medicine and the companionship of West more and more irritating; but when he had gone to Ottawa and through a colleague\u2019s influence secured a medical commission as Major, I could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that I should accompany him in my usual capacity. When I say that Dr. West was avid to serve in battle, I do not mean to imply that he was either naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation. Always an ice-cold intellectual machine; slight, blond, blue-eyed, and spectacled; I think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality. There was, however, something he wanted in embattled Flanders; and in order to secure it he had to assume a military exterior. What he wanted was not a thing which many persons want, but something connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to follow, and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results. It was, in fact, nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in every stage of dismemberment. Herbert West needed fresh bodies because his life-work was the reanimation of the dead. This work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in Boston; but was only too well known to me, who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in Miskatonic University Medical School at Arkham. It was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments, first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained. There was a solution which he injected into the veins of dead things, and if they were fresh enough they responded in strange ways. He had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula, for each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it."}

Since the driveway was on the other side of the house, it was clear the trip was not going straight. It had not been expected. It was simply following a general plan to make my task longer. This, however, meant that all paths leading to the mailbox were also blocked. The weather could not have known what route I planned to take. If this was true, I would have to go across the lawn away from any path. How could I do that considering the Root-filled state of all the nearby ground? For a moment my mind spun.

He prepared himself for the whining sounds of the old coffee maker. These sounds came up from the edge of the counter. machine was on, luckily, and seemed to be working. He had a ltitle time to get ready before leaving for the day's work. So he quickly poured out some of the dark, grainy substance. The machine was very ready and agreed the process should start. He was surprised by the pot's stained, crusty look. He saw the strange, odd-looking leftover that others had mentioned during the past week. There was not much, though, that he could do. He had not seen the machine on any earlier coffee-making trip. He did not know what the curious leftover could be. However, he had heard the neighbor who lived rgiht next door. This neighbor was talking to grocer one morning. They were telling each other how much they feared the coming of the first hour of dawn. Dawn was now only moments away. They were sharing sorry comments about the poor, troubled young professional. Henderson, the man next to his apartment, had talked about night-time sounds. These were both metallic and gurgling sounds. He also talked about the threatening steam he saw one morning. He had sneaked over fearfully to look through the kitchen window taht morning. He told the grocer he did not dare to look after he saw that steam through the cracks in the blinds. There had been a low hissing sound, too. As he started to describe it, his voice had dropped to a whisper you could not hear.\n###\nHe took the grimy carafe down to the kitchen, steeling himself against the whines of the antiquated percolator which welled up from the counter\u2019s edge. The machine was on, thank heaven, and appeared to be stirring about. There was time for a little preparation before departing for the day\u2019s labours, so he hurriedly poured forth a measure of the dark, granular substance. The apparatus was very receptive, and agreed that the process ought to be begun. He was shocked by the pot\u2019s stained, encrusted aspect, and noticed the queer, abnormal-looking residue which others had remarked during the past week. There was not much, though, that he could do. He had not observed the device on any previous brewing expedition, and had no idea what the curious sediment could be. He had, though, heard the neighbour who dwelled just next door speaking to the grocer one morning. They were telling each other how badly they dreaded the coming of the dawn\u2019s first hour, now only a few moments off; and were exchanging pitying comments about the poor, beleaguered young professional. Henderson, the fellow next to his apartment, had spoken of nocturnal percussions both metallic and gurgling, and of the sinister steam he saw one morning when he had stolen fearfully over to peer through the kitchen window. He had not dared to peer, he told the grocer, after he had glimpsed that vapour through the fissures in the blinds. There had been a low hissing, too\u2014and as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisper."}

On one side, the whole city can be seen. It slopes from the plaza down to the old river bank. On the other side, very close, one sees the richly decorated. Perfectly preserved front of a large building. It is clearly a temple, carved from solid rock. Only guesses can be made about the original making of this huge thing. The front is very large. It seems to cover a continuous hollow space inside. This is because it has many windows spread widely. In the center is a large open door. An impressive set of steps leads to it. It is surrounded by fine carvings like figures of Bacchanals in relief. The great columns and frieze are Foremost. Both are decorated with sculptures of incredible beauty. They show idealized country scenes and lines of priests and priestesses. They carry strange ceremonial objects to worship a shining god. The art is perfectly made. It is largely Hellenic in idea, but also strangely unique. It gievs a feeling of great age. It seems like the most distant ancestor of Greek art, not the closest one. Nor can it be doubted that every part of this massive structure was made from the untouched hillside rock of our planet. It is clearly part of the valley wall. But how the huge inside was ever dug out remains unimaginable. Maybe a cvae or series of caves provided the start. Neither age nor beign underwater has damaged the original greatness of this awful temple\u2014for it must be a temple. Today, after thousands of years, it remains perfect. Untouched in the endless night. Silence of an ocean deep.\n###\nIn about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky wall of the valley. On one side I could view the entire city as it sloped from the plaza down to the old river-bank; on the other side, in startling proximity, I was confronted by the richly ornate and perfectly preserved facade of a great building, evidently a temple, hollowed from the solid rock. Of the original workmanship of this titanic thing I can only make conjectures. The facade, of immense magnitude, apparently covers a continuous hollow recess; for its windows are many and widely distributed. In the centre yawns a great open door, reached by an impressive flight of steps, and surrounded by exquisite carvings like the figures of Bacchanals in relief. Foremost of all are the great columns and frieze, both decorated with sculptures of inexpressible beauty; obviously portraying idealised pastoral scenes and processions of priests and priestesses bearing strange ceremonial devices in adoration of a radiant god. The art is of the most phenomenal perfection, largely Hellenic in idea, yet strangely individual. It imparts an impression of terrible antiquity, as though it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of Greek art. Nor can I doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned from the virgin hillside rock of our planet. It is palpably a part of the valley wall, though how the vast interior was ever excavated I cannot imagine. Perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the nucleus. Neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this awful fane\u2014for fane indeed it must be\u2014and today after thousands of years it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of an ocean chasm."}

It is doubtful if everyone could have survived the storm, even without the other problem. The storm, with its fierce blowing ice particles, must have been worse than anything expedition had faced before. One airplane shelter was almots crushed.

The containers were very uneven in shape. I did not care about that small detail anymore. I went straight to the cupboard that the kitchen light showed. I appeared quickly at clock. It showed the time was after midnight. The plastic made a noise but felt strong enough. I lifted the pile of different containers. I moved them past a shaky middle layer to the counter below. Everything was very messy. My rearranging only made empty sounds. Finally I reached the bottom container. At one edge I saw a slightly bent corner. This showed the manufacturing mistake that caused problems. On the other side, I found the lid was also not shaped right. I looked inside and down five uneven ridges.

Most decayed sculptures, it is clear a clumsy early mammal was used for food. As a funny clown by the land dwellers. This mammal clearly had hints of ape and human features.

They had been suffered to develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the dominant beings. Bothersome forms, of course, were mechanically exterminated. It interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent sculptures a shambling primitive mammal, used sometimes for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers, whose vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable. In the building of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by vast-winged pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to palaeontology."}

He pushed it while looking for the Fenner casket. It was as he recognized Matt \u2019s coffin that the door slammed shut in the wind. This left him in a darkness than. The transom window let in the ryas. The ventilation funnel let in none. he was reduced to fumbling. He made his way among the boxes toward the latch. In this funeral twilight, he rattled the handles. He pushed at the iron panels. He wondered why the door had grown. In this twilight,, he began to realize the truth. He began to shout. It was as if his horse could do than neigh an reply. The - neglected latch was broken. This left the undertaker trapped in the vault. He was a victim of his mistake. This must have happened at three - thirty in the afternoon. Birch, being and by nature, did not shout for. He proceeded to feel for some tools. He remembered seeing them in a corner of the tomb. It is he was affected by the horror and weirdness of his situation. The fact of being imprisoned. from where people walked was to annoy him. His day \u2019s work was interrupted. Unless chance brought some walker, he might have to stay all night. He reached the pile of tools. He selected a hammer and chisel. Birch went over the coffins to the door.

Sawyer was not a lovable man, and many stories were told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or fancied. To him Birch had felt no compunction in assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest for the Fenner casket. It was just as he had recognised old Matt\u2019s coffin that the door slammed to in the wind, leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before.

In this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles, pushed at the iron panels, and wondered why the massive portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant. In this twilight, too, he began to realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than neigh an unsympathetic reply. For the long-neglected latch was obviously broken, leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault, a victim of his own oversight. The thing must have happened at about three-thirty in the afternoon. Birch, being by temperament phlegmatic and practical, did not shout long; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb. It is doubtful whether he was touched at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position, but the bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly. His day\u2019s work was sadly interrupted, and unless chance presently brought some rambler hither, he might have to remain all night or longer. The pile of tools soon reached, and a hammer and chisel selected, Birch returned over the coffins to the door. The air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome; but to this detail he paid no attention as he toiled, half by feeling, at the heavy and corroded metal of the latch. He would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle; but lacking these, bungled semi-sightlessly as best he might. When he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding, at least to such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these, Birch glanced about for other possible points of escape."}

It was made of furs and tent cloth taken from Lake 's camp. We did not stop to study the strange shapes the fabrics were cut into. Slightly beyond this point we saw a clear increase in the size. Number of side passages. We decided we must have reached the densely honeycombed area under the higher foothills. The unknown smell was now oddly mixed with another, almost as bad smell. We could not guess its nature. We thought of rotting living things and maybe unknown underground fungi. Then came a surprising widening of the tunnel. The carvings had not prepared us for this. It broadened and rose into a tall, natural - looking oval cave with a flat [THING]. It was about 75 feet long and 50 feet wide. Many huge side passages led away into hidden darkness. Though this cave looked natural, looking with both torches suggested it was made by artificially breaking several walls between nearby honeycomb areas. The walls were rough. The high arched roof was thick with hanging [THING] spikes. But the solid [THING] [THING] had been smoothed. It was free from all rubble, debris, or even dust to a extremely abnormal degree. Except for the path we came by, this was true for the floors of all the big passages opening from it. The oddness of this condition made us puzzle uselessly. The curious new stink that added to the unknown smlel was very strong here. It was so strong it wiped out all trace of the other. Something about this whole place, with its polished. Almost shiny [THING], struck us as more vaguely confusing. Horrible than any monstrous thing we met before. The regularity of the passage straight ahead. The larger amount of penguin droppings there, prevented all confusion about the right way among this excess of equally big cave mouths. Still, we decided to restart our [THING] trail - blazing if any more complexity appeared. We could no longer expect dust tracks, of course. Upon continuing our direct path, we shone a torch beam on the tunnel walls. We stopped suddenly in surprise at the extremely radical change that had come over the carvings in this part of the passage.\n###\nThe temperature was rapidly ascending, and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us. It was composed of furs and tent-cloth taken from Lake\u2019s camp, and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed. Slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the side-galleries, and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been reached. The nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odour\u2014of what nature we could not guess, though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterrene fungi. Then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us\u2014a broadening and rising into a lofty, natural-looking elliptical cavern with a level floor; some 75 feet long and 50 broad, and with many immense side-passages leading away into cryptical darkness. Though this cavern was natural in appearance, an inspection with both torches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings. The walls were rough, and the high vaulted roof was thick with stalactites; but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off, and was free from all debris, detritus, or even dust to a positively abnormal extent. Except for the avenue through which we had come, this was true of the floors of all the great galleries opening off from it; and the singularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling. The curious new foetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the other. Something about this whole place, with its polished and almost glistening floor, struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered. The regularity of the passage immediately ahead, as well as the larger proportion of penguin-droppings there, prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great cave-mouths. Nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trail-blazing if any further complexity should develop; for dust tracks, of course, could no longer be expected. Upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel walls\u2014and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage."}

I had read the earlier records. I knwe something about the mysterious methods of the Eastern department. Its bookkeeping was very mixed with that of main office. I, by the light of the computer screens, tried to understand the strange. Almost ruined data in some unevenly shaped boxes. These boxes were usually thought to be summaries. But we could not understand them at all. We remembered that one pattern, a kind of flowing total, was believed by experts to mean a mistake in the department. It suggested these numbers had just been copied by the current clerk frmo some older. Maybe useless record book in the same storage room. On one of these boxes were some red highlights that made me curious. The biggest one, in the middle of the page, had some details in the top row. These showed its link to the final total. It was probably a terrible error in calculation.\n###\nThe reference to the quarterly report made me shudder, for I had perused the previous entries and knew something of the arcane formulae of the Eastern division, whose accounting was so mixed with that of the central office. Jenkins and I, by the glow of monitors, tried to interpret the odd and nearly corrupted data in certain irregularly formatted cells generally held to be summaries, but could make nothing of them. We remembered that one pattern, a sort of cascading total, was held by analysts to imply a departmental error, suggesting that these figures had merely been imported by the current clerk from some older and perhaps obsolete ledger in the same archive. On one of these cells were some crimson highlights which made me wonder.

Mr. Ward got up atfer the meal. He started to go upstairs to Charless' laboratory. On the third floor, he stopped. He heard sounds coming from his son's library, which was no longer used. Books were apparently benig thrown about, and papers were being rustled wildly. Mr. Ward stepped to the door. He saw the youth inside. Charles was excitedly gathering a huge amrful of books. Papers of all sizes. Charles looked very tired and worried. He dropped his whole load, startled by the sound of his father's voice. At his father's command, he sat down. For some time, he listened to the scolding he had deserved. There was no argument. At the end of the lecture, he agreed his father was right. He agreed that his noises, mutterings, chants, and chemical smells were indeed unacceptable nuisances. He agreed to be quieter. But he insisted on keeping his extreme privacy. He said Much of his future work was only book research anywya. He could get another place for any vocal rituals that might be needed later. For frightening and making his mother faint, he expressed regret. He explained that the conversation heard later was part of a complex symbolism. It was meant to create a certain mental atomsphere. His use of difficult technical terms somewhat confused Mr. Ward. The final impression was of clear sanity. Calm, despite a very serious. The talk was really quite inconclusive. As Charles picked up his armful and left the room, Mr. Ward hardly knew what to think of the whole matter. It was as mysterious as the death of poor Nig. Nig's stiff body had been found an hour before in the basement. His eyes were staring, and his mouth was twisted with fear.\n###\nMr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charles\u2019s laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charles\u2019s aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his father\u2019s voice. At the elder man\u2019s command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth."}

He did not always glance at the same place in the sky\u2014it seemed to be a different place at different times. On spring evenings it would be low in the northeast. In the summer it would be nearly overhead. In the autumn it would be in the northwest. In winter it would be in the east, but mostly if in the small hours of morning. Midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him. Only after two years did I connect this fear with anything in particular; but then I began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glance\u2014a spot roughly marked by the constellation Corona Borealis. We now had a studio in London, never separating, but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world. We were aged and weak from our drugs, dissipations, and nervous overstrain, and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become snow-white. Our freedom from long sleep was surprising, for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace. Then came one January of fog and rain, when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy. My statues and ivory heads were all sold, and I had no means to purchase new materials, or energy to fashion them even had I possessed them. We suffered terribly, and on a certain night my friend sank into a deep-breathing sleep from which I could not awaken him.

This caused Mrs. Ward ran upstairs and listened at the door. She could only hear a part. The onyl clear words were \"must have it red for three months\". When she knocked, all sounds stopped at once.

The youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with himself, for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused Mrs. Ward to run upstairs and listen at the door. She could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were \u201cmust have it red for three months\u201d, and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once. When Charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid, but which he would try to transfer to other realms."}

Looking for minerals about 500 miles east in desert, many strange cut stone pieces were found. They were about 3 by 2 by 2 feet in size. They were very weathered and full of hole.s At first, none of the marks the Aboriginal people talked about could be found. But upon very close looking, some deeply carved lines could be seen despite the weathering. They were unusual curves, just like what the Aboriginal people had tried to describe. It is thought there must have been 30 or 40 blocks. Some were almost buried in the sand. All were within an area about a quarter of a mile across.\n###\nBut what I have to tell is more than this. Two years ago, when I was prospecting about 500 miles east in the desert, I came on a lot of queer pieces of dressed stone perhaps 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 feet in size, and weathered and pitted to the very limit. At first I couldn\u2019t find any of the marks the blackfellows told about, but when I looked close enough I could make out some deeply carved lines in spite of the weathering.

For a moment, a poor copy of a small picture of the mad Rhoby Harris appears. That picture had been seen in the School of Design Museum. At another time, one thinks the thin image of Mercy Dexter is seen. This is remembered from a painting in Carrington Harris's house. It was more frightening than anything one can imagine. Near the end, a mix of servant and baby faces flickered near the moldy floor. A pool of greenish grease was spreading there. The changing features seemed to fight each other. They tried to form shapes like the uncle's kind face. It is tempting to think he existed at that moment. It is tempting to think he tried to say godobye. It seems a goodbye is gasped from a dry throat as one staggers into street.

It did not seem needed to protect the plane with a snow wall for such a time. With such a lack of winds at this height. We made the landing skis were placed. That the parts of the machine were protected from the cold. For our walk we left behind our flying clothes. We took a kit with a pocket compass, a hand camera, food supplies, notebooks. Paper, a geologist 's hammer. Chisel, sample bags, a coil of climbing rope. flashlights with batteries. This equipment had been carried in the plane in case we could land, take pictures of the ground, make drawings. Get rock samples from some slope, rock. we had paper to tear up, put in a sample bag. Use on the hare-. -hounds principle to mark our path in any mazes we might enter. This was brought in case we found a cave system with air to allow this. method of the rock - chipping way of marking a trail. Wlaking over the crusted snow toward the stone mzae that rose against the sk,y we felt a sense of coming wonders as we had felt nearing the mountain pass four hours. By, we had seen with our eyes the secret hidden by the barrier peaks. The thought of going inside walls made by thinking beings millions of years agowas awe -. in what it suggested about strangeness. Though the air at tihs height made effort a bit than, both my companion. I found ourselves doing. Felt for any job we might face. a steps took us to a ruin worn with the snow. Fifteen rods was a roofless wall in its five - shape. Rising to an height of ten. We aimed for this one. When we could touch its weathered stone blocks, we felt we had made a. connection with forgotten ages shut off from our kind.\n###\nIt did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level; hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged, and that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold. For our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs, and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass, hand camera, light provisions, voluminous notebooks and paper, geologist\u2019s hammer and chisel, specimen-bags, coil of climbing rope, and powerful electric torches with extra batteries; this equipment having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing, take ground pictures, make drawings and topographical sketches, and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope, outcropping, or mountain cave. Fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up, place in a spare specimen-bag, and use on the ancient principle of hare-and-hounds for marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to penetrate. This had been brought in case we found some cave system with air quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the usual rock-chipping method of trail-blazing. Walking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west, we felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously. True, we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks; yet the prospect of actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years ago\u2014before any known race of men could have existed\u2014was none the less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality. Though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat more difficult than usual; both Danforth and I found ourselves bearing up very well, and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our lot. It took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the snow, while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic five-pointed outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet. For this latter we headed; and when at last we were able actually to touch its weathered Cyclopean blocks, we felt that we had established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our species."}

As the whole chaotic mass became just a symmetrical crossing, I started to look down again. I saw that my job's finish was not far away.

It choked and rumbled out the mockeries of hell in a cracked, mocking low voice. Instantly, every moving being was excited. They formed at once into a formal line. The nightmare crowd slid away looking for the sound. There were goats, satyrs. Goat-like creatures, male demons, female demons. Ghosts, twisted toads. Shapeless basic things, dog-faced howlers. Silent walkers in darkness. All were led by the horrible naked glowing thing that had sat on the carved gold throne. It now walked bolldy holding in its arms the glassy-eyed body of the fat old man.

So I moved from one cheap boarding [THING] to another. I looked for a [THING] that was decently clean, had bearable furniture. Was very low cost. I soon saw I only had a choice between bad options. But after a while, I found a [THING] on West Fourteenth Street. It disgusted me much less than the others I had tried. The [THING] was a four - story brownstone mansion. It seemed to be from the late 1840s. It had woodwork and marble. Their stained and dirty beauty suggested a fall from a high level of tasteful wealth. The rooms were large and high. They had ugly wallpaper and very fancy plaster moldinsg. A sad musty smell and a hint of strange cooking lingered. But the floors were clean. The bed sheets were fairly normal. The hot [THING] was not too often cold or shut off. I began to see it as a bearable place to stay dormant until I could really live again.\n###\nIt might be in the visible world, yet it might be only in his mind and soul.

There are those who say I respond to cold as others do to a bad odour, and I am the last to deny the impression. What I will do is to relate the most horrible circumstance I ever encountered, and leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable explanation of my peculiarity. It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness, silence, and solitude. I found it in the glare of mid-afternoon, in the clangour of a metropolis, and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace rooming-house with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side. In the spring of 1923 I had secured some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of New York; and being unable to pay any substantial rent, began drifting from one cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might combine the qualities of decent cleanliness, endurable furnishings, and very reasonable price. It soon developed that I had only a choice between different evils, but after a time I came upon a house in West Fourteenth Street which disgusted me much less than the others I had sampled. The place was a four-story mansion of brownstone, dating apparently from the late forties, and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of tasteful opulence. In the rooms, large and lofty, and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices, there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the floors were clean, the linen tolerably regular, and the hot water not too often cold or turned off, so that I came to regard it as at least a bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again."}

This continued until the night when the infamous Necronomicon by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred was brought home. It is known the feared book was first known about at age sixteen. A growing interest in strange things led to asking an ol,d bent bookseller in Chandos Street unusual questions. One always wondered why people turned pale when they mentioned it. The old bookseller said only five copies survived after priests and lawmakers banned it. Those copies were locked away carefluly by keepers who had tried to read the difficult old text. But now a copy that could be accessed was found. It was obtained for a very low price at a Jewish shop in the poor area of Clare Market. Strange things had often been bought there befroe. It is almost thought the wrinkled old Levite smiled in his thick beard when the discovery was made. The large leather cover with a brass clasp was very easy to see. The price was surprisingly small.\n###\nSo matters went till that night when Williams brought home the infamous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. He had known of the dreaded volume since his sixteenth year, when his dawning love of the bizarre had led him to ask queer questions of a bent old bookseller in Chandos Street; and he had always wondered why men paled when they spoke of it. The old bookseller had told him that only five copies were known to have survived the shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers against it and that all of these were locked up with frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful black-letter. But now, at last, he had not only found an accessible copy but had made it his own at a ludicrously low figure. It was at a Jew\u2019s shop in the squalid precincts of Clare Market, where he had often bought strange things before, and he almost fancied the gnarled old Levite smiled amidst tangles of beard as the great discovery was made. The bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been so prominently visible, and the price was so absurdly slight."}

The clippings mostly talked about very odd mental sicknesses. Craziness in the spring of 1925. The first half of main writing told a very strange story. It seems that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young [THING] visited Professor Angell. He looked nervous and excited. He brought the strange clay carving. It was very wet and fresh then. His card had the name Henry Anthony Wilcox. My uncle knew him as the youngest son of a good family he knew a little. The young [THING] had recently bene studying sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design. He lived alone at the Fleur - de - Lys Building near the school. Wilcox was a gifted young [THING] known for talent but great oddness. Since childhood, he drew attention with the strange stories. Odd dreams he liked to tell. He called himself \" psychically very sensitive \". But the steady [THING] of the old business [THING] just called him \" queer \". He did not mix much with others. He slowly disappeared from social view. Now only a small group of art lovers from other towns knew him. Even the Providence Art Club, wanting to keep its traditional ways, found him hopeless. On the visit, the professor 's writing said, the sculptor suddenly asked for his host 's knowledge of old things. He wanted help naming the picture - writings on the carving. He spoke in a dreamy, stiff way that seemed fake and pushed [THING] away. My uncle answered sharply. The clear newness of the tablet meant it was not old at all. Young Wilcox 's answer impressed my uncle. He remembered it word for word and wrote it down. It was very poetic. This must have been like all his talk. I have since found this very typical of hmi. He said, \" It is new, yes, because I made it last night in a dream of strange cities. Dreams are older than thinking Tyre. Gardens around Babylon. \" Then he began that wandering story. It suddenly touched a sleeping memory and won my uncle 's feverish interest. There had been a small earthquake shake the night before. It was the strongest felt in New England for some years. Wilcox 's imagination had been strongly affected. When he went to bed, he had an unheard - of dream. He dreamed of great Cyclopean cities made of giant blocks and [THING] - high single stones. All were wet with green slime and full of hidden horror.\n###\nThe cuttings largely alluded to outr\u00e9 mental illnesses and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of 1925. The first half of the principal manuscript told a very peculiar tale. It appears that on March 1st, 1925, a thin, dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon Professor Angell bearing the singular clay bas-relief, which was then exceedingly damp and fresh. His card bore the name of Henry Anthony Wilcox, and my uncle had recognised him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him, who had latterly been studying sculpture at the Rhode Island School of Design and living alone at the Fleur-de-Lys Building near that institution. Wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity, and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating. He called himself \u201cpsychically hypersensitive\u201d, but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely \u201cqueer\u201d. Never mingling much with his kind, he had dropped gradually from social visibility, and was now known only to a small group of aesthetes from other towns. Even the Providence Art Club, anxious to preserve its conservatism, had found him quite hopeless. On the occasion of the visit, ran the professor\u2019s manuscript, the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host\u2019s archaeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics on the bas-relief. He spoke in a dreamy, stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy; and my uncle shewed some sharpness in replying, for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archaeology. Young Wilcox\u2019s rejoinder, which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim, was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation, and which I have since found highly characteristic of him. He said, \u201cIt is new, indeed, for I made it last night in a dream of strange cities; and dreams are older than brooding Tyre, or the contemplative Sphinx, or garden-girdled Babylon.\u201d It was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle. There had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before, the most considerable felt in New England for some years; and Wilcox\u2019s imagination had been keenly affected. Upon retiring, he had had an unprecedented dream of great Cyclopean cities of titan blocks and sky-flung monoliths, all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror."}

When it had lost its horror at its strange temporary form, it was allowed to study its new surroundings. It could then feel a wonder and wisdom close to that of its pusher. With proper care. In trade for proper services, it was allowed to move all over the livable world in giant airships. On the huge boat-like atomic-powered vehicles that traveled the great roads. It could dig freely into the libraries holding the records of the planet's past. This made many caught minds accept their fate. Since none were other than sharp. To such minds the revealing of hiddne mysteries of earthforms always, despite the deep horrors often shown, the highest experience of life. Then some caught minds were allowed to meet other caught minds taken from the future. They could exchange thoughts wiht consciousnesses living a hundred. A million years before. After their own times. All were pushed to write a lot in their own languages about themselves. Their own periods. Such papers were to be filed in the great central archives. It may be added that there was one sad special type of captive whose rights were far greater than those of most. These were the dying permanent exiles. Their bodies in future had been seized by sharp-minded members of the Great Race who, facing death, tried to escape mental end. Such sad exiles were not as common as might be expected. The long life of the Great Race lessened its love of lifeincluding mankind's. As for the normal cases of explroation\u2014when the pushing mind had learned what it wanted in the future, it would build a device like that which had started its flight. Reverse the process of projection. Once more it would be in its own body in its own time. The recently caught mind would return to that body of the future to which it rightly belonged. Only when one. The other of the bodies had died during the swap was this return impossible.\n###\nWhen the captive mind\u2019s amazement and resentment had worn off, and when (assuming that it came from a body vastly different from the Great Race\u2019s) it had lost its horror at its unfamiliar temporary form, it was permitted to study its new environment and experience a wonder and wisdom approximating that of its displacer. With suitable precautions, and in exchange for suitable services, it was allowed to rove all over the habitable world in titan airships or on the huge boat-like atomic-engined vehicles which traversed the great roads, and to delve freely into the libraries containing the records of the planet\u2019s past and future. This reconciled many captive minds to their lot; since none were other than keen, and to such minds the unveiling of hidden mysteries of earth\u2014closed chapters of inconceivable pasts and dizzying vortices of future time which include the years ahead of their own natural ages\u2014forms always, despite the abysmal horrors often unveiled, the supreme experience of life. Now and then certain captives were permitted to meet other captive minds seized from the future\u2014to exchange thoughts with consciousnesses living a hundred or a thousand or a million years before or after their own ages. And all were urged to write copiously in their own languages of themselves and their respective periods; such documents to be filed in the great central archives. It may be added that there was one sad special type of captive whose privileges were far greater than those of the majority. These were the dying permanent exiles, whose bodies in the future had been seized by keen-minded members of the Great Race who, faced with death, sought to escape mental extinction. Such melancholy exiles were not as common as might be expected, since the longevity of the Great Race lessened its love of life\u2014especially among those superior minds capable of projection. From cases of the permanent projection of elder minds arose many of those lasting changes of personality noticed in later history\u2014including mankind\u2019s. As for the ordinary cases of exploration\u2014when the displacing mind had learned what it wished in the future, it would build an apparatus like that which had started its flight and reverse the process of projection. Once more it would be in its own body in its own age, while the lately captive mind would return to that body of the future to which it properly belonged. Only when one or the other of the bodies had died during the exchange was this restoration impossible."}

The leader of these outsiders quickly became the main interest of the whole meeting. He was an ordinary-looking middle-aged man. He came all the way from New Orleans to get special information he could not find locally. His name was John Raymond Legrasse. His job was an Inspector of Police. He brought the reason for our visit. It was a strange, ugly, and very old stone statue. We did not know where it came from. We did not care about archaeology. Our need to understand was for work reasons only. The statue, idol, or fetish was captured months ago. It was taken from the wooded swamps south of New Orleans. Police raided a suspected voodoo meeting. The rituals linked to it were very strange and horrible. We realized we found a dark cult we did not know. It was much more evil than the worst African voodoo groups. We knew nothing of its origin. We only had strange, unbelievable stories from captured members. That is why we wanted any old knowledge. We hoped it would help identify the scary symbol. Then we could find the cult's source.\n###\nThe chief of these outsiders, and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting, was a commonplace-looking middle-aged man who had travelled all the way from New Orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source. His name was John Raymond Legrasse, and he was by profession an Inspector of Police. With him he bore the subject of his visit, a grotesque, repulsive, and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine. It must not be fancied that Inspector Legrasse had the least interest in archaeology. On the contrary, his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations. The statuette, idol, fetish, or whatever it was, had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of New Orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it, that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them, and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the African voodoo circles. Of its origin, apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members, absolutely nothing was to be discovered; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol, and through it track down the cult to its fountain-head."}

That same June evening, without having heard a word from the sea, Malone was desperately busy among the alleys of Red Hook. A sudden stir seemed to spread through the place. As if told by \"grapevine telegraph\" of something singular, the residents gathered expectantly around the dance-hall church. The houses in Parker Place. Three children had just disappeared.

A sudden stir seemed to permeate the place, and as if apprised by \u201cgrapevine telegraph\u201d of something singular, the denizens clustered expectantly around the dance-hall church and the houses in Parker Place. Three children had just disappeared\u2014blue-eyed Norwegians from the streets toward Gowanus\u2014and there were rumours of a mob forming among the sturdy Vikings of that section. Malone had for weeks been urging his colleagues to attempt a general cleanup; and at last, moved by conditions more obvious to their common sense than the conjectures of a Dublin dreamer, they had agreed upon a final stroke. The unrest and menace of this evening had been the deciding factor, and just about midnight a raiding party recruited from three stations descended upon Parker Place and its environs. Doors were battered in, stragglers arrested, and candlelighted rooms forced to disgorge unbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in figured robes, mitres, and other inexplicable devices. Much was lost in the melee, for objects were thrown hastily down unexpected shafts, and betraying odours deadened by the sudden kindling of pungent incense. But spattered blood was everywhere, and Malone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier or altar from which the smoke was still rising. He wanted to be in several places at once, and decided on Suydam\u2019s basement flat only after a messenger had reported the complete emptiness of the dilapidated dance-hall church. The flat, he thought, must hold some clue to a cult of which the occult scholar had so obviously become the centre and leader; and it was with real expectancy that he ransacked the musty rooms, noted their vaguely charnel odour, and examined the curious books, instruments, gold ingots, and glass-stoppered bottles scattered carelessly here and there. Once a lean, black-and-white cat edged between his feet and tripped him, overturning at the same time a beaker half full of a red liquid. The shock was severe, and to this day Malone is not certain of what he saw; but in dreams he still pictures that cat as it scuttled away with certain monstrous alterations and peculiarities. Then came the locked cellar door, and the search for something to break it down. A heavy stool stood near, and its tough seat was more than enough for the antique panels."}

Then came a dreadful examination of hallway. I traced whatever designs the peeling strips could show. Finally, my searching fingers felt the texture falling apart. I looked even closer. I examined the seams or edges with my eyes. I used both hands in my careful search. No color was kept inside. As my look went deeper, I knew my search was over for now. The paper was the leftover part of a decoration. It was put on a vertical plaster wall older than the nearby panels. It was surely the trace of some past and detailed decorative plan. I leaned forward carefully. I tried to stop the brittel pieces from falling aprat more. But I failed in that attempt. As I stood frozen before the decaying wall, I heard the sfot rustle of its collapse.

Then came a dreadful inspection of the hallway, tracing whatever designs the peeling strips could show; till finally my probing fingers found the texture crumbling, and I looked closer still, examining the seams or edges with my eyes as I used both hands in my cautious investigation. There was no color preserved therein, and as my scrutiny went deeper I knew that my search was for the nonce ended; since the paper was the remnant of a decoration applied to a vertical plaster plane of greater antiquity than the adjacent panels, no doubt the vestige of some bygone and elaborate ornamental scheme. I leaned forward warily, and tried to prevent the brittle fragments from falling further into decay; but failed in the latter attempt.

After that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well immediately, so Ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside. The men sniffed in disgust at the fluid, and toward the last held their noses against the foetor they were uncovering. It was not so long a job as they had feared it would be, since the water was phenomenally low. There is no need to speak too exactly of what they found. Merwin and Zenas were both there, in part, though the vestiges were mainly skeletal. There were also a small deer and a large dog in about the same state, and a number of bones of smaller animals. The ooze and slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling, and a man who descended on hand-holds with a long pole found that he could sink the wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting any solid obstruction. Twilight had now fallen, and lanterns were brought from the house. Then, when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the well, everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient sitting-room while the intermittent light of a spectral half-moon played wanly on the grey desolation outside. The men were frankly nonplussed by the entire case, and could find no convincing common element to link the strange vegetable conditions, the unknown disease of livestock and humans, and the unaccountable deaths of Merwin and Zenas in the tainted well. They had heard the common country talk, it is true; but could not believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred. No doubt the meteor had poisoned the soil, but the illness of persons and animals who had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter. Was it the well water? Very possibly. It might be a good idea to analyse it. But what peculiar madness could have made both boys jump into the well? Their deeds were so similar\u2014and the fragments shewed that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death."}

Why they did this, I do not know. Many [THING] dislike the sound of a [THING] at night. Many aslo dislike cast sneaking around yards and gardens at dusk. Whatever the reason, this old couple liked to trap. Kill evrey [THING] that came near their small [THING]. From some noises heard after dark, many villagers thought the way they killed was very strange. The villagers did not talk about such things with old [THING]. This was because of the usual look on their dry, old faces. It was also because their cottage was very small. It was hidden darkly under wide oak trees at the back of an untended yard. In truth, the [THING] owners hated these odd [THING]. But they feared them even more. So they did not scold them as cruel murderers. They only made sure no beloved pet. Mouse - hunter went near the distant [THING] under the dark trees. When, by some unavoidable mistake, a [THING] was gone. Noises were heard after dark, the owner would complain helplessly. He would comfort himself by thanking Fate that it was not one of his children who had disappeared. For the [THIN]G of Ulthar were simple. They did not know where all cats originally came from. One day, a group of strange travelers from the South came into the narrow [THING] streets of Ulthar. They were Dark travelers. They were not like the other roaming [THING] who cmae through the [THING] twice each year. In the market square, they told fortunes for money. They also bought bright beads from the sellers. No one could tell what ladn these travelers came from. But [THING] saw that they performed strange prayers. They had also painted strange pictures on the sides of their wagons. The pictures showed shapes with human bodies. The heads of cats, hawks, rams. The leader of the group wore a headpiece with two horns. There was a curious disc between the horns. In this unusual group, there was a little boy. He had no father and no mother. He only had a tiny black kitten to love. Sikcness had not been good to him. But it had left him this small furry thing to ease his sadness. When one is very young, one can find much comfort in the playful actions of a black kitten.\n###\nIn Ulthar, before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats, there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbours. Why they did this I know not; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night, and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight. But whatever the reason, this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel; and from some of the sounds heard after dark, many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar. But the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two, and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard. In truth, much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk, they feared them more; and instead of berating them as brutal assassins, merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees. When through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed, and sounds heard after dark, the loser would lament impotently; or console himself by thanking Fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished. For the people of Ulthar were simple, and knew not whence it is all cats first came. One day a caravan of strange wanderers from the South entered the narrow cobbled streets of Ulthar. Dark wanderers they were, and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year. In the market-place they told fortunes for silver, and bought gay beads from the merchants. What was the land of these wanderers none could tell; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers, and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats, hawks, rams, and lions. And the leader of the caravan wore a head-dress with two horns and a curious disc betwixt the horns. There was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother, but only a tiny black kitten to cherish. The plague had not been kind to him, yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow; and when one is very young, one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten."}

As the hills come closer, their wooded sides receive more attention than their stone-topped peaks. Those sides appear. Steep that a wish is felt for them to stay far away. No road is found to escape them. Across a covered bridge, a small village is seen crowded between the stream. The steep slope of Round Mountain. One wonders at the group of rotting gambrel roofs, which show an earlier building style than the nearby area. Looking closer, it is not comforting to observe that most houses are empty. The church with the broken steeple now holds the only messy store in the village. The dark tunnel of the bridge is feared. There is no way to avoid it. Once across, a faint, evil smell on the village street is hard to dismiss. It smells like centuries of gathered mold and decay. It is always a relief to leave the place. One follows the narrow road around the bottom of the hills. Across the flat land beyond until it meets the Aylesbury pike again. Afterward it is sometmies leanred that one has passed through Dunwich.\n###\nAs the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich."}

The bed was, and still is, the kind that would interest a careful observer. It was not simple or semi-simple piece of furniture. It followed the common home sleeping setups of the mid-twentieth century. It was the common rectangular type. It had a mattress and a box spring base. It had a cotton-polyester blend and a pattenred duvet. These were standard for home life at that time. It faced north. One side was against the lower wall in the corner that leaned west. The other side was open to the floor toward the room doro. This arrangement, each morning. Evening, followed the smoothing. Straightening of the bed linens in that special routine.

My nerves were on edge. A strange, twisted eagerness whipped me on. It came from that unexplainable urge toward the northeast. The urge was mixed with dread and false memory. I walked slowly on under the bad, burning moon. Here and there I saw, half-covered by sand, those ancient Cyclopean blocks. They were left from unknown and forgotten ages. The unbelievable age. Lurking horror of this hgue empty place began to crush me as never before. I could not stop thinking of my maddening dreams. I thought of the terrible stories behind them. I thought of the current fears of local people. Miners about the desert. Its carved stoens. And yet I walked on as if to some weird meeting. I was more and more attacked by confusing thoughts, strong urges, and false memories. I thought of some possible shapes of the stone lines my son saw from the air. I wondered why they seemed both so threatening and so familiar. Something was fumbling and rattling at the lock of my memory. At the same tiem, another unknown force tried to keep the door closed. The night had no wind. The pale sand curved up and down like frozen ocean waves. I had no goal. But somehow I pushed forward as if with a sure sense of fate. My dreams rose into the waking world. Each sand-covered large stone seemed part of endless rooms and halls. They were made of masonry from before humans. They were carved and marked with symbols. I knew these symbols too well from years of habit as a captive mind of the Great Race. At times I imagined I saw those all-knowing cone-shaped horrors moving about at their usual tasks. I was afraid to look down. I feared I would find myself looking like one of them. I saw the sand-covered blocks as well as the rooms. I saw the bad, burning moon as well as the lamps of glowing crystal. I saw the endless desert as well as the waving ferns. Cycads outside the windows. I was awake and dreaming at the same time. I do not know how long or how far I walked. I do not know in what direction I walked. This was when I first saw the pile of blocks uncovered by the day's wind. It was the largest group in one place I had seen so far. It impressed me so sharply that the visions of amazing ages suddenly faded away. Again there were only the desert. The bad moon. The pieces of past no one could guess.\n###\nNerves on edge, and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable, dread-mingled, pseudo-mnemonic urge toward the northeast, I plodded on beneath the evil, burning moon. Here and there I saw, half-shrouded by the sand, those primal Cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons. The incalculable age and brooding horror of this monstrous waste began to oppress me as never before, and I could not keep from thinking of my maddening dreams, of the frightful legends which lay behind them, and of the present fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stones. And yet I plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvous\u2014more and more assailed by bewildering fancies, compulsions, and pseudo-memories. I thought of some of the possible contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air, and wondered why they seemed at once so ominous and so familiar. Something was fumbling and rattling at the latch of my recollection, while another unknown force sought to keep the portal barred. The night was windless, and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves of the sea. I had no goal, but somehow ploughed along as if with fate-bound assurance. My dreams welled up into the waking world, so that each sand-embedded megalith seemed part of endless rooms and corridors of pre-human masonry, carved and hieroglyphed with symbols that I knew too well from years of custom as a captive mind of the Great Race. At moments I fancied I saw those omniscient conical horrors moving about at their accustomed tasks, and I feared to look down lest I find myself one with them in aspect. Yet all the while I saw the sand-covered blocks as well as the rooms and corridors; the evil, burning moon as well as the lamps of luminous crystal; the endless desert as well as the waving ferns and cycads beyond the windows. I was awake and dreaming at the same time. I do not know how long or how far\u2014or indeed, in just what direction\u2014I had walked when I first spied the heap of blocks bared by the day\u2019s wind. It was the largest group in one place that I had so far seen, and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away. Again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an unguessed past."}

Less than a week after we returned to England, strange things started to happen. We lived like recluses. We had no friends, were alone. Had no servants in a few rooms of an old manor-house on a bare, lonely moor. So visitors rarely knocked on our doors. Now, however, we were bothered by what seemed like frequent fumbling at night. This happened not only at the doors. Also at windows, both upstairs. Once we imagined a large, dark shape blocked the library window when the moon shone on it. Another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound nearby. Each time we checked and found nothing. We started to think it was just our imagination. That same troubled imagination also kept the faint, far-off howl we thought we heard in the Holland churchyard in our ears. The jade amulet now sat in a niche in our museum. Sometimes we burned oddly scented candles before it. We read much in Alhazred\u2019s Necronomicon about its traits. About how ghouls\u2019 souls relate to what it symbolized.

We lived as recluses; devoid of friends, alone, and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient manor-house on a bleak and unfrequented moor; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor. Now, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be frequent fumblings in the night, not only around the doors but around the windows also, upper as well as lower.

As two men of size tried to hold him back, he had fought with strength. He screamed of his wish. Need to find. Kill a ' thing that shines., after knocking down one of the men holding him for a time with a hit, he had thrown himself upon the in a joy of blood. He shrieked like a fiend that he would ' jump in the air. Burn his way through anything that stopped him '. Faimly and neighbors had run in a panic. When the braver of them returned, Slater was gone. He left behind an pulp - thing that had been a living man an hour.\n###\nHe had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time, and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace. Not that his form of language was at all unusual, for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment; but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness, that none might listen without apprehension. He himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors, and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said, or at least all that had caused him to say what he did; relapsing into a bovine, half-amiable normality like that of the other hill-dwellers. As Slater grew older, it appeared, his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence; till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities. One day near noon, after a profound sleep begun in a whiskey debauch at about five of the previous afternoon, the man had roused himself most suddenly; with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought several neighbours to his cabin\u2014a filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as indescribable as himself. Rushing out into the snow, he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air; the while shouting his determination to reach some \u2018big, big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor, and the loud queer music far away\u2019. As two men of moderate size sought to restrain him, he had struggled with maniacal force and fury, screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain \u2018thing that shines and shakes and laughs\u2019. At length, after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow, he had flung himself upon the other in a daemoniac ecstasy of bloodthirstiness, shrieking fiendishly that he would \u2018jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him\u2019. Family and neighbours had now fled in a panic, and when the more courageous of them returned, Slater was gone, leaving behind an unrecognisable pulp-like thing that had been a living man but an hour before."}

Gad, I wouldn\u2019t be alive if I\u2019d ever seen what that man\u2014if he was a man\u2014saw! You recall that Pickman\u2019s forte was faces. I don\u2019t believe anybody since Goya could put so much of sheer hell into a set of features or a twist of expression. And before Goya you have to go back to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on Notre Dame and Mont Saint-Michel. They believed all sorts of things\u2014and maybe they saw all sorts of things, too, for the Middle Ages had some curious phases. I remember your asking Pickman yourself once, the year before you went away, wherever in thunder he got such ideas and visions. Wasn\u2019t that a nasty laugh he gave you? It was partly because of that laugh that Reid dropped him. Reid, you know, had just taken up comparative pathology, and was full of pompous \u201cinside stuff\u201d about the biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or physical symptom. He said Pickman repelled him more and more every day, and almost frightened him toward the last\u2014that the fellow\u2019s features and expression were slowly developing in a way he didn\u2019t like; in a way that wasn\u2019t human. He had a lot of talk about diet, and said Pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree. I suppose you told Reid, if you and he had any correspondence over it, that he\u2019d let Pickman\u2019s paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination. I know I told him that myself\u2014then. But keep in mind that I didn\u2019t drop Pickman for anything like this.

He did not help with the digging. Seeing the work could not be stopped. It was decided to go home soon for one's nerves. The narrator's son promised a flight to Perth. Perth is a thousand miles southwest. The flight would happen after the area one wanted letf alone was checked. It is thought that if the thing seen was still there, one might give a warning even if people laughed. The miners who know local stories might help one. Humouring the narrator, the son checked the area that afternoon. He flew over all the ground the walk could have covered. Nothing found was still visible. It was like the strange basalt rock again. The moving sand removed all signs. For a moment one almost regretted losing a scary object in that fear. But now it is known the loss was good. One can still think the whole experience was not real. This is especially true if, as is hoped, that terrible pit is never found.\n###\nThe next day I was up and around the camp, but took no part in the excavations. Seeing that I could not stop the work, I decided to return home as soon as possible for the sake of my nerves, and made my son promise to fly me in the plane to Perth\u2014a thousand miles to the southwest\u2014as soon as he had surveyed the region I wished let alone. If, I reflected, the thing I had seen was still visible, I might decide to attempt a specific warning even at the cost of ridicule. It was just conceivable that the miners who knew the local folklore might back me up. Humouring me, my son made the survey that very afternoon; flying over all the terrain my walk could possibly have covered. Yet nothing of what I had found remained in sight. It was the case of the anomalous basalt block all over again\u2014the shifting sand had wiped out every trace. For an instant I half regretted having lost a certain awesome object in my stark fright\u2014but now I know that the loss was merciful.

This record, he had said, was obtained about 1 a.m. on the first of May, 1915, near the closed mouth of a cave where the wooded west slope of Dark Mountain rises out of Lee\u2019s Swamp. The place had always been unusually plagued with strange voices, this being the reason he had brought the phonograph, dictaphone, and blank in expectation of results. Former experience had told him that May-Eve\u2014the hideous Sabbat-night of underground European legend\u2014would probably be more fruitful than any other date, and he was not disappointed. It was noteworthy, though, that he never again heard voices at that particular spot. Unlike most of the overheard forest voices, the substance of the record was quasi-ritualistic, and included one palpably human voice which Akeley had never been able to place. It was not Brown\u2019s, but seemed to be that of a man of greater cultivation. The second voice, however, was the real crux of the thing\u2014for this was the accursed buzzing which had no likeness to humanity despite the human words which it uttered in good English grammar and a scholarly accent. The recording phonograph and dictaphone had not worked uniformly well, and had of course been at a great disadvantage because of the remote and muffled nature of the overheard ritual; so that the actual speech secured was very fragmentary. Akeley had given me a transcript of what he believed the spoken words to be, and I glanced through this again as I prepared the machine for action. The text was darkly mysterious rather than openly horrible, though a knowledge of its origin and manner of gathering gave it all the associative horror which any words could well possess. I will present it here in full as I remember it\u2014and I am fairly confident that I know it correctly by heart, not only from reading the transcript, but from playing the record itself over and over again. It is not a thing which one might readily forget! . . . is the Lord of the Woods, even to . . . and the gifts of the men of Leng . . . so from the wells of night to the gulfs of space, and from the gulfs of space to the wells of night, ever the praises of Great Cthulhu, of Tsathoggua, and of Him Who is not to be Named."}

However, three dark and mocking merchants stood nearby. They were grinning. The sight of the humps in their turbans made him feel very weak. The terrible smell coming up through the evil-looking hatches also maed him feel faint. He saw wonderful lands and cities moving past him. A fellow dreamer from Earth had often talked about these places in the past. That dreamer was a lighthouse keeper in ancient Kingsport. He recognized the terraces with temples of Zar. This is the home of forgotten dreams. He saw the tall spires of the terrible city Thalarion. That is a demon-city with a thousand wonders. The phantom Lathi rules there. He saw the gardens of bones in Xura. That is the land of pleasures no one can reach. He saw the two crystal headlands. They meet high above in a shining arch. They guard the harbor of Sona-Nyl. That is the blessed land of imagination. Past all these beautiful lands, the bad-smelling ship flew in an unhealthy way. It was pushed by the strange, powerful strokes of the unseen rowers below the deck. Before the day ended, Carter saw that the steersman must be heading for Basalt Pillars of the West. Simple people say splendid Cathuria lies beyond that place. However, wise dreamers know the truth. They know those are the gates of a huge and monstrous waterfall. There, all the oceans of Earth's dreamland fall completely into a bottomless nothingness. They shoot through empty space toward other worlds and other stars. They go toward the terrible voids outside the organized universe. In that chaos, the demon-sultan Azathoth chews hungrily. There is pounding and piping sounds there. There is also the hellish dancing of the Other Gods. They are blind. Tehy have no voice. They are dark and have no mind. Their soul and messenger is Nyarlathotep. During this time, the three mocking merchants would not say what they planned. However, Carter knew very well they must be working with others. Those others wanted to stop him from his search. It is commonly understood in the dreamland that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men. All these agents are eager to do the will of those blind and mindless things. They do this to gain the favor of their horrible soul and messenger. Thta messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. The agents may be fully human or slightly less than human. So Carter concluded the merchants with the humped turbans had heard about his brave search. He was searching for the Great Ones in their castle on Kadath. They decided to capture him and take him away. They would deliver him to Nyarlathothep. They would do this for whatever unknown reward might be offered for such a prize. Carter could not guess what land those merchants came from. They might be from our known universe or from the strange spaces outside it. He also could not imagien what hellish meeting place they would use. There, they would meet the crawling choas to hand him over and claim their reawrd.\n###\nHe was not chained, but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby, and the sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches. He saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellow-dreamer of earth\u2014a lighthouse-keeper in ancient Kingsport\u2014had often discoursed in the old days, and recognised the templed terraces of Zar, abode of forgotten dreams; the spires of infamous Thalarion, that daemon-city of a thousand wonders where the eidolon Lathi reigns; the charnal gardens of Xura, land of pleasures unattained, and the twin headlands of crystal, meeting above in a resplendent arch, which guard the harbour of Sona-Nyl, blessed land of fancy. Past all these gorgeous lands the malodorous ship flew unwholesomely, urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below. And before the day was done Carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the Basalt Pillars of the West, beyond which simple folk say splendid Cathuria lies, but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth\u2019s dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemon-sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the Other Gods, blind, voiceless, tenebrous, and mindless, with their soul and messenger Nyarlathotep. Meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent, though Carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest. It is understood in the land of dream that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men; and all these agents, whether wholly human or slightly less than human, are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger, the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep. So Carter inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans, hearing of his daring search for the Great Ones in their castle on Kadath, had decided to take him away and deliver him to Nyarlathothep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize. What might be the land of those merchants, in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside, Carter could not guess; nor could he imagine at what hellish trysting-place they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward."}

The observer crossed the gorge again on the Main Street bridge. He entered a completely deserted area. It made him shiver for some reason. Collapsing groups of gambrel roofs made a rough and skyline. Above them rose the scary, headless steeple of an church. Some houses along Main Street had people living in them. But most were closed up wtih boards. On Down unpaved side streets he saw the black, open windows of houses. Many of these leaned at dangerous and hard-to-believe angles. This was because part of their foundations had sunk. Those windows looked so ghostly that it required courage to turn esat toward the waterfront. Certainly, the fear from one house grows much faster when many houses form a city of complete emptiness. Seeing such streets of dead-looking spaces makes one think. thought is of enldess connected black rooms of spider webs, memories, and decay. This starts fears and dislikes. Even the strongest philosophy cannot remove them.\n###\nRe-crossing the gorge on the Main Street bridge, I struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder. Collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline, above which rose the ghoulish, decapitated steeple of an ancient church. Some houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse."}

When he did enter he saw something dark in the corner, and upon seeing it more clearly he screamed outright. While he screamed he thought a momentary cloud eclipsed the window, and a second later he felt himself brushed as if by some hateful current of vapour.

I am its main digger in this forgotten place. Much was shown to me last night. They were objects of the most ancient and memory-stirring kind. More will be dug up by me later. I will do this through touch exploration and through dusty records. I will not be asked to take any item outside just yet. But I will probably be forced to do so later. This will use great effort. Go beyond everything we have been used to seeing as orderly home life. My garage will be attacked no lnoger. Everything has gone back to a state of listed control. The spiders will have no more safe place. Instead of messy plenty, I have been given rich gift of finding again. Few other people have ever seen this.\n###\nAs a beginning of this formidable undertaking, the accumulated detritus has naturally chosen me\u2014whose familiarity with its depths is already so intimate\u2014as its primary excavator in this forgotten realm. Much was revealed to me last evening\u2014objects of the most antiquated and memory-stirring nature\u2014and more will be subsequently unearthed by me both through tactile exploration and through dusty documentation. I shall not be called upon to remove any item outside just yet, though I shall probably be compelled to do so later on\u2014employing prodigious effort and transcending everything which we have hitherto been accustomed to regard as orderly domesticity. My garage will be besieged no longer. Everything has reverted to a state of catalogued dominion, and the spiders will have no further sanctuary. In place of chaotic profusion I have been given a rich boon of rediscovery and tangible history which few other inhabitants have ever beheld."}

Eight years my junior, he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and I sixteen. He was the most phenomenal child scholar I have ever known, and at seven was writing verse of a sombre, fantastic, almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him. Perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering. An only child, he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side. He was never allowed out without his nurse, and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children. All this doubtless fostered a strange, secretive inner life in the boy, with imagination as his one avenue of freedom."}

OUR feelinggs of tight nervous hope as we goot ready to go around the top. Look out OVER an untouched world are hard to put on paper. This was true even though WE had no reason to think the areas beyond the mountain range were very different from those we had already seen. The hint of eivl mystery in these blocking mountains. IN the inviting sea of milky sky seen between their peaks, was a very fine. It could not be explained in simple words. Rather was it a matter of unclear mind symbols. Beauty links\u2014a thing mixed with foreign poetry. With old myths hiding in avooided. Even the wind's sound carried a special tone of aware badness. For a moment, it seemed the mixed sound included a strange musical whistling. Piping over a wide range. This happened as the wind blew in. Out of the ever-present. Echoing cave openings. There was a cloudy note of memory-based dislike in this sound. It was as complex and hard to place as any of the other dark feelings.\n###\nOur sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper; even though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from those already seen and traversed. The touch of evil mystery in these barrier mountains, and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits, was a highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal words. Rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic association\u2014a thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes. Even the wind\u2019s burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity; and for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cave-mouths. There was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressions."}

The pile on the wooden folding table had grown after a wash. It included several of the clean cloths. But on top of this household amount was added a process complication. This made the amount seem unimportant. Out of a possible seventy-five towels that had been in this spot, not one folded example could be seen. The messy fabric was covered with wrinkles and cloth flaws. These showed too clearly the damage of rough handling and rushed drying. Yet no clear plan showed itself for arranging the mess. That some awful boredom must be the reason, everyone quickly agreed. No one now brought back the idea that such puzzling disorder was just the normal mess known in busy homes. That idea was only borught back when about twenty-five of the guessed number were found missing from the unfolded ones. Even then it was to explain the mess of fifty by half that number. The fact stayed that on a weekday afternoon a chore had come from the home area.

The task was indeed there. The pile upon the oaken folding-table had accumulated after a washing cycle, comprising several of the immaculate linens; but upon this domestic quantity was superimposed a procedural complexity which paled it to insignificance. Of a possible seventy-five towels which had inhabited this spot, not one folded specimen was visible. The disordered fabric was covered with creases and textile irregularities bespeaking too vividly the ravages of careless handling and haphasty drying; yet no visible method presented itself for the ordering of the chaos. That some hideous tedium must be the cause, everyone quickly agreed; nor did any tongue now revive the notion that such cryptic disarray formed merely the common disorder known in busy households. That notion was revived only when about twenty-five of the estimated number were found missing from the unfolded; and even then it was hard to explain the dishevelment of fifty by half that number. But the fact remained that on a weekday afternoon a duty had come out of the domestic sphere and left a chaotic accumulation whose textiles were horribly rumpled, twisted, and entangled."}

The blocking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed recently half - cleared. We quickly decided this was the route the others used to go down. This would be the logical route for us to go up. This was despite the long [THING] trail we left elsewhere. The tower 's opening was no farther from the foothills. Our waiting plane than the big terraced [THING] we entered. Any further exploration under the ice on this trip would be in this general area. Oddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips. This was even after all we had seen and guessed. Then, as we carefully walked over the debris on the big [THING], we saw something. This sight pushed all other thoughts away for the mometn. It was the neat, grouped line of three sledges. Thye were in that farther corner of the ramp 's lower, outward - reaching path. This spot had been hidden from our view until now. There they were. They were the three sledges missing from Lake 's camp. They showed signs of hard use. This must have included forced dragging over long stretches of snowless [THING] and debris. It also included much carrying by [THING] over completely impassable places. They were packed and strapped carefully and smartly. They contained very familiar things. There was the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument cases, [THING] tins, and tarps. Some tarps clearly bulged with books. Others bulged with less obvious contents. Everything came from Lake 's equipment. After what we found in that other [THING], we were somewhat ready for this find. The real great shock came when we stepped over and opened one tarp. Its shape had strangely disturbed us. It seems others besides Lake had been interested in collecting typical samples. For there were two here. Both were stiffly frozen and perfectly preserved. They had adhesive plaster patches where some neck wounds were. They were wrapped with obvious care to prevent more damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing [THING]. Many [THING] will probably think us cold and crazy. They will think this because we thought about the north tunnel. Soon after our grim discovery. I am not ready to say we would have thought those thoughts again right away. But a specific event happened to us. It started a whole new line of thinking.\n###\nAs it was, the ramp shewed sad battering; whilst the choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently half-cleared. It took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had descended, and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere. The tower\u2019s mouth was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered, and any further sub-glacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie in this general region. Oddly, we were still thinking about possible later trips\u2014even after all we had seen and guessed. Then as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor, there came a sight which for the time excluded all other matters. It was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramp\u2019s lower and outward-projecting course which had hitherto been screened from our view. There they were\u2014the three sledges missing from Lake\u2019s camp\u2014shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and debris, as well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places. They were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped, and contained things memorably familiar enough\u2014the gasoline stove, fuel cans, instrument cases, provision tins, tarpaulins obviously bulging with books, and some bulging with less obvious contents\u2014everything derived from Lake\u2019s equipment. After what we had found in that other room, we were in a measure prepared for this encounter. The really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us. It seems that others as well as Lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens; for there were two here, both stiffly frozen, perfectly preserved, patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds around the neck had occurred, and wrapped with patent care to prevent further damage. They were the bodies of young Gedney and the missing dog. Many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our sombre discovery, and I am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations."}

As I gained this rest, I heard the pounding at the two doors lessen. At the time, a clatter came from the connecting door I had blocked with the bed frame., of my attackers had entered the room. They were gathering for a side attack. At the moment, a master key sounded in the door to the north. I knew a danger was at hand. The connecting door was. There was no time to think about stopping the turning lock in the hall. All I could do was shut and bolt the connecting door. I bolted its matching door on the side.

As I gained this respite I heard the battering at the two other doors abate, while a confused clatter came from the connecting door I had shielded with the bedstead. Evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack. But at the same moment a pass-key sounded in the next door to the north, and I knew that a nearer peril was at hand. The northward connecting door was wide open, but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall. All I could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door, as well as its mate on the opposite side\u2014pushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other, and moving a washstand in front of the hall door. I must, I saw, trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till I could get out the window and on the roof of the Paine Street block. But even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defences. I was shuddering because not one of my pursuers, despite some hideous pantings, gruntings, and subdued barkings at odd intervals, was uttering an unmuffled or intelligible vocal sound. As I moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows I heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me, and perceived that the southward battering had ceased. Plainly, most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me. Outside, the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below, and I saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which I must land. Surveying the conditions, I chose the more southerly of the two windows as my avenue of escape; planning to land on the inner slope of the roof and make for the nearest skylight. Once inside one of the decrepit brick structures I would have to reckon with pursuit; but I hoped to descend and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the shadowed courtyard, eventually getting to Washington Street and slipping out of town toward the south."}

More and more, he would sit by his window facing west. He would look at the faraway hill and the stern steeple that birds avoided. When the leaves appeared on the garden branches, the world became very But Blake only felt more restless. It was then that he fisrt considered going across the city. He thought of climbing that legendary slope himself. He wanted to enter the smoke-filled world of dreams. In Arkham, just before the time shadowed by eons, Blake made his first journey into the unknown. He went through the endless downtown streets. He passed the bleak, decaying squares beyond them. Finally, he found the rising avenue. It had steps worn by centuries, sagging Doric porches, and cupolas with dirty windows. He felt this must lead up to the long-known, unreachable world beyond the fog. There were dirty blue-and-white street signs. They meant nothing to him. Soon, he noticed the faces of the moving crowds. He saw foreign signs on shops in brown, aged buildings. Nowhere could he find any of the things he had seen from a distance. So, once again, he almost believed the sight from far away was a dream-world. He thought no living human could ever walk there. Sometimes, he saw a damaged church front or a crumbling spire. But he never saw the blackened building he was looking for. He asked a shopkeeper about a stone church. The man smiled and shook his head. However, he spoke English freely. Blake climbed higher. The area seemed stranger and stranger. There were confusing mazes of gloomy brown alleys. They seemed to lead south forever. He crossed two or three avenues. Once, he thought he saw a familiar tower. Again, he asked a merchant about the stone church. This time, he was sure the claim of not knowing was fake. The man's face showed a look of fear. He tried to hide it. Blake saw him make a sign with his right hand. Then, suddenly, a black spire appeared against the cloudy sky on his left. It rose above the layers of brown roofs along the tangled southern alleys. Blake knew immediately what it was. He rushed toward it through the dirty, unpaved lanes. These lanes climbed up from the avenue. Twice he lost his way. But somehow, he did not dare to ask for help. He did not ask the men or housewives sitting on their doorsteps. He did not ask the children shouting. Playing in the mud of the shadowy lanes.\n###\nMore and more he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and the black, frowning steeple shunned by the birds. When the delicate leaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new beauty, but Blake\u2019s restlessness was merely increased. It was then that he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up that fabulous slope into the smoke-wreathed world of dream. Late in April, just before the aeon-shadowed Walpurgis time, Blake made his first trip into the unknown. Plodding through the endless downtown streets and the bleak, decayed squares beyond, he came finally upon the ascending avenue of century-worn steps, sagging Doric porches, and blear-paned cupolas which he felt must lead up to the long-known, unreachable world beyond the mists. There were dingy blue-and-white street signs which meant nothing to him, and presently he noted the strange, dark faces of the drifting crowds, and the foreign signs over curious shops in brown, decade-weathered buildings. Nowhere could he find any of the objects he had seen from afar; so that once more he half fancied that the Federal Hill of that distant view was a dream-world never to be trod by living human feet. Now and then a battered church facade or crumbling spire came in sight, but never the blackened pile that he sought. When he asked a shopkeeper about a great stone church the man smiled and shook his head, though he spoke English freely. As Blake climbed higher, the region seemed stranger and stranger, with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys leading eternally off to the south. He crossed two or three broad avenues, and once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower. Again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone, and this time he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned. The dark man\u2019s face had a look of fear which he tried to hide, and Blake saw him make a curious sign with his right hand. Then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left, above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys. Blake knew at once what it was, and plunged toward it through the squalid, unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue. Twice he lost his way, but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or housewives who sat on their doorsteps, or any of the children who shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes."}

The rooms we visited were wholly bare of all portable contents, a circumstance which sustained our belief in the city\u2019s deliberate desertion. The prime decorative feature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture; which tended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and arranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width given over to geometrical arabesques. There were exceptions to this rule of arrangement, but its preponderance was overwhelming. Often, however, a series of smooth cartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk along one of the arabesque bands. The technique, we soon saw, was mature, accomplished, and aesthetically evolved to the highest degree of civilised mastery; though utterly alien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race. In delicacy of execution no sculpture I have ever seen could approach it. The minutest details of elaborate vegetation, or of animal life, were rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the carvings; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skilful intricacy. The arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles, and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the quantity of five. The pictorial bands followed a highly formalised tradition, and involved a peculiar treatment of perspective; but had an artistic force that moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast geologic periods. Their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the cross-section with the two-dimensional silhouette, and embodied an analytical psychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity. It is useless to try to compare this art with any represented in our museums. Those who see our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque conceptions of the most daring futurists. The arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines whose depth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches. When cartouches with dot-groups appeared\u2014evidently as inscriptions in some unknown and primordial language and alphabet\u2014the depression of the smooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half, and of the dots perhaps a half-inch more. The pictorial bands were in counter-sunk low relief, their background being depressed about two inches from the original wall surface."}

During this time, Sarnath became. priests and women remembered what Taran - Ish wrote on the chrysolite altar. A caravan route developed between Betwixt Sarnath and the city of Ilarnek. metals from the earth were traded. They were exchanged for metals. They were exchanged for cloths and jewels. They were exchanged for books and tools for artificers. They were exchanged for all luxury items known to the people living along the winding Ai river. Sarnath grew and learned and. It sent out conquering armies to neighboring cities. In time, the kings of all Mnar land. lands sat on a throne in Sarnath. Sarnath the magnificent was the wonedr of the world. It was the pride of all mankind. Its walls were made of marble from the desert. They were 300 cubits and 75 cubits. Chariots could pass each as men drove them along the top. The walls ran for a 500 stadia. They were on the side toward the lake. A stone sea - wall kept the waves. The waves rose a year at the festival for destroying Ib. There were fifty streets from the lake to the caravan gate.s Fifty streets intersected them. They were paved with onyx. The streets where horses, camels, and elephants trod were paved with granite. Sarnath had gates as the landward ends of the streets. Each gate was made of bronze. Each was flanked by figures of lions and elephants. These figures were carved from a stone known among men. The houses of Sarnath were made of glazed brick and chalcedony. Each house had its walled garden and crystal lakelet. They were built with art. No city had houses like them. Travellers from Thraa, Ilarnek. Kadatheron marvelled at the shining domes on top of the houses. The palaces and temples were. The gardens made by king Zokkar were. There were palaces. The of these palaces were than any in Thraa, Ilarnek, or Kadatheron. They were that a person might feel beneath the sky. When lighted with torches dipped in Dothur oil, their walls showed paintings. The paintings were of kings and armies. Theri splendour was both inspiring and stupefying to the beholder.\n###\nAnd many centuries came and went, wherein Sarnath prospered exceedingly, so that only priests and old women remembered what Taran-Ish had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite. Betwixt Sarnath and the city of Ilarnek arose a caravan route, and the precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along the winding river Ai and beyond. So Sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful, and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighbouring cities; and in time there sate upon a throne in Sarnath the kings of all the land of Mnar and of many lands adjacent. The wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was Sarnath the magnificent. Of polished desert-quarried marble were its walls, in height 300 cubits and in breadth 75, so that chariots might pass each other as men drave them along the top. For full 500 stadia did they run, being open only on the side toward the lake; where a green stone sea-wall kept back the waves that rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of Ib. In Sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans, and fifty more intersecting them. With onyx were they paved, save those whereon the horses and camels and elephants trod, which were paved with granite. And the gates of Sarnath were as many as the landward ends of the streets, each of bronze, and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men. The houses of Sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony, each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet. With strange art were they builded, for no other city had houses like them; and travellers from Thraa and Ilarnek and Kadatheron marvelled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmounted. But more marvellous still were the palaces and the temples, and the gardens made by Zokkar the olden king. There were many palaces, the least of which were mightier than any in Thraa or Ilarnek or Kadatheron. So high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of Dothur their walls shewed vast paintings of kings and armies, of a splendour at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder."}

Saying a mental shock caused the idea is wrogn. That idea made one run from the lonely Akeley farmhouse. One drove through the wild hills of Vermont in a taken car at night. Notwithstanding the information and ideas from Henry Akeley were shared. The things that were seen and heard made a strong impression. Even now, one cannot prove if the idea was right or wrong. Akeley's disappearance does not prove anything. People found nohting wrong in his house. There were bullet marks inside and outside. It seemed like he just went for a walk in the hills. Did not come back. There was no sign a guest had been there. There was no sign of the cylinders and machines in the study. He was very afraid of the green hills and streams where he grew up. But that means nothing. Many people have such fears. Eccentricity could also explain his actions and fears near the end.\n###\nBear in mind closely that I did not see any actual visual horror at the end. To say that a mental shock was the cause of what I inferred\u2014that last straw which sent me racing out of the lonely Akeley farmhouse and through the wild domed hills of Vermont in a commandeered motor at night\u2014is to ignore the plainest facts of my final experience. Notwithstanding the deep extent to which I shared the information and speculations of Henry Akeley, the things I saw and heard, and the admitted vividness of the impression produced on me by these things, I cannot prove even now whether I was right or wrong in my hideous inference. For after all, Akeley\u2019s disappearance establishes nothing. People found nothing amiss in his house despite the bullet-marks on the outside and inside. It was just as though he had walked out casually for a ramble in the hills and failed to return. There was not even a sign that a guest had been there, or that those horrible cylinders and machines had been stored in the study. That he had mortally feared the crowded green hills and endless trickle of brooks among which he had been born and reared, means nothing at all, either; for thousands are subject to just such morbid fears. Eccentricity, moreover, could easily account for his strange acts and apprehensions toward the last."}

They said they could not solve the Inspector's problem. But one man in the group suspected something. The monster's shape and writing seemed oddly familiar to him. He then shyly told what little he knew. Tihs man was the late William Channing Webb. He was Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University. He was also a well-known explorer. Professor Webb was on a trip 48 years before. He traveled through Greenland and Iceland looking for Runic inscriptions. He did not find them. High on the West Greenland coast, he met a strange tribe. Cult of degraded Esquimaux. Their religion was a curious form of devil-worship. Its deliberate bloodthirstiness and ugliness chilled us. Other Esquimaux knew little of this faith. They mentioned it only with fear. They said it came from horribly ancient times before the world existed. Among its nameless rites and human sacrifices were certain odd hereditary rituals. These were for a supreme elder devil or tornasuk. Professor Webb had made a careful sound copy from an old angekok or wizard-priest. He wrote the sounds in Roman letters as best we could. But now the most important thing was the fetish this cult valued. They danced around it when the aurora shone over the ice cliffs. The professor said it was a very crude stone bas-relief. It had a hideous picture and some cryptic writing. As far as we could tell, it was roughly the same in all key features as the beastly tihng now before the meeting.\n###\nAnd yet, as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the Inspector\u2019s problem, there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing, and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew. This person was the late William Channing Webb, Professor of Anthropology in Princeton University, and an explorer of no slight note. Professor Webb had been engaged, forty-eight years before, in a tour of Greenland and Iceland in search of some Runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth; and whilst high up on the West Greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate Esquimaux whose religion, a curious form of devil-worship, chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness. It was a faith of which other Esquimaux knew little, and which they mentioned only with shudders, saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made. Besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk; and of this Professor Webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or wizard-priest, expressing the sounds in Roman letters as best he knew how. But just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished, and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs. It was, the professor stated, a very crude bas-relief of stone, comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing. And so far as he could tell, it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting."}

Secrets, what conflicts. Violations of Nature, had returned after a hundred. They came to trouble Old Providence with its church towers and domes. The father and the doctor knew what to do or think. Thye went to see Charles at the hospital. They asked him as they could about Dr. Allen. They asked about the Prague visit. They asekd what he had learned about Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. The man gave answers that did not commit to anything for all these questions. He spoke in his whisper. He said he had found Dr. Allen had an connection with some souls from the past. He said any contact the man might have in Prague would have the ability.\n###\nHave ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. Stones are all chang\u2019d now in Nine groundes out of 10. You are never sure till you question. I this day heard from H., who has had Trouble with the Soldiers. He is like to be sorry Transylvania is pass\u2019d from Hungary to Roumania, and wou\u2019d change his Seat if the Castel weren\u2019t so fulle of What we Knowe.

F. if you can possibly get him for me. You know G. in Philada. better than I. Have him up firste if you will, but doe not use him soe hard he will be Difficult, for I must speake to him in ye End. Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent bit of unrelieved insanity. Only by degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply. So the absent Dr. Allen, and not Charles Ward, had come to be the leading spirit at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild reference and denunciation in the youth\u2019s last frantic letter. And what of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as \u201cMr. J. C.\u201d? There was no escaping the inference, but there are limits to possible monstrosity. Who was \u201cSimon O.\u201d; the old man Ward had visited in Prague four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind there had been another Simon O.\u2014Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem, who vanished in 1771, and whose peculiar handwriting Dr. Willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the Orne formulae which Charles had once shewn him. What horrors and mysteries, what contradictions and contraventions of Nature, had come back after a century and a half to harass Old Providence with her clustered spires and domes? The father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think, went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about Dr. Allen, about the Prague visit, and about what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in Prague would probably be similarly gifted."}

The book, as I expected, was about twenty by fifteen inches in size. Two inches thick. The thin metal covers opened at the top. Its tough cellulose pages seemed untouched by the countless cycles of tmie they had lived through. I studied the strangely colored, brush-drawn letters of the text. The symbols were completely unlike the usual curved picture writing. Any alphabet known to human learning. I felt a haunting, half-awakened memory. It came to me that this was the languaeg used by a trapped mind I had known a little in my dreams. That mind was from a large asteroid. Much of ancient life and knowledge from the original planet had survived there. The asteroid was a piece of that planet. At the same time, I remembered that this level of the record halls was for books dealing with planets not from Earth. I stopped looking closely at this unbelievable document. I saw that my torchlight was starting to fade. So I quickly put in the extra battery I always carried with me. Then, with the stronger light, I started my feverish running again. I ran through endless tangles of walkways and hallways. Now and then I recognized some familiar shelf. I was vaguely bothered by the sound conditoins. They made my footsteps echo wrongly in these underground tobms of death. Silence that had lasted for ages. The very marks of my shoes behind me in the dust, untouched for thousands of years, made me shake. Never before, if my mad dreams held any truth, had human feet stepped on those ancient floors. My conscious mind held no clue about the specific goal of my insane running. However, some force of evil power pulled at my confused will and buried memories. So I vaguely felt I was not running without aim. I came to a downward slope and followed it to deeper levels. Floors flashed by me as I ran. I did not stop to look at them. In my spinning brain, a certain rhythm had begun to beat. It made my right hand twitch in time with it. I wanted to unlock something. I felt that I knew all the complicated twists and pressures needed to do it. It would be like a modern safe with a combination lock. Dream or not, I had once known and still knew. I did not try to explain to myself how any dream.

It came to me that this was the language used by a captive mind I had known slightly in my dreams\u2014a mind from a large asteroid on which had survived much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet whereof it formed a fragment. At the same time I recalled that this level of the archives was devoted to volumes dealing with the non-terrestrial planets. As I ceased poring over this incredible document I saw that the light of my torch was beginning to fail, hence quickly inserted the extra battery I always had with me. Then, armed with the stronger radiance, I resumed my feverish racing through unending tangles of aisles and corridors\u2014recognising now and then some familiar shelf, and vaguely annoyed by the acoustic conditions which made my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs of aeon-long death and silence. The very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden dust made me shudder. Never before, if my mad dreams held anything of truth, had human feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements. Of the particular goal of my insane racing, my conscious mind held no hint. There was, however, some force of evil potency pulling at my dazed will and buried recollections, so that I vaguely felt I was not running at random. I came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths. Floors flashed by me as I raced, but I did not pause to explore them. In my whirling brain there had begun to beat a certain rhythm which set my right hand twitching in unison. I wanted to unlock something, and felt that I knew all the intricate twists and pressures needed to do it. It would be like a modern safe with a combination lock.

One cannot hope to explain the true horror and fear in these pieces. This is because those feelings mainly depend on a completely intangible quality. That quality is the sharp sense of false memory.

This helpful effect is increased by the subtle feeling of familiarity that comes with time passing. Yet, despite everything, the unclear, slow terror returns briefly now and then.

Mathematically developed to the highest level of ordinary skill. It was completely foreign in every part to any known money practice of regular people. In fineness of work no account book I have ever seen could come near it. The smallest points of complex debts. Of interest math, were shown with amazign clearness despite the large size of the numbers. Meanwhile the standard entries were wonders of skilled detail. The columns showed a deep use of math rules. They were made of oddly equal totals and balances based on the number ten. The monthly reports followed a very set custom. They involved a strange handling of decimals. They had a math power that moved us deeply despite the separating gap of huge time periods. Their way of matching depended on a unique placing together of the credit with the two-dimensional deibt. It included an analysis exactness beyond that of any known bookkeeper of old times. It is pointless to try to compare this bookkeeping with any shown in our ledgers. Those who see our records will likely find its nearest match in some odd ideas of the boldest number experts.\n###\nThe technique, we soon saw, was methodical, precise, and arithmetically evolved to the highest degree of mundane mastery; though utterly alien in every detail to any known financial practice of the common man. In delicacy of execution no ledger I have ever seen could approach it. The minutest details of elaborate debits, or of interest calculations, were rendered with astonishing clarity despite the bold scale of the figures; whilst the conventional entries were marvels of skilful intricacy. The columns displayed a profound use of mathematical principles, and were made up of obscurely symmetrical sums and balances based on the quantity of ten. The monthly statements followed a highly formalised tradition, and involved a peculiar treatment of decimals; but had an arithmetical force that moved us profoundly notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast temporal cycles. Their method of reconciliation hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the credit with the two-dimensional debit, and embodied an analytical exactitude beyond that of any known clerk of antiquity. It is useless to try to compare this accounting with any represented in our ledgers. Those who behold our registers will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque conceptions of the most daring actuaries."}

They were mountains of madness. Their sides looked out over a cursed hole. That boiling, - cloud background gave hints of a vague, airy beyond. It was than space. It gave reminders of the distance, separation, loneliness. Age - death of this. world. It was Danforth who poinetd out the shapes of the mountain skyline. These shapes were like clinging pieces of cubes. Lake had mentioned these in his messages. They suppotred his comparison with dream - hints of temple ruins. These ruins were on mountain tops. They were painted in a and way by Roerich. There was something Roerich - about this continent of mystery. I had felt it in October when we saw Victoria Land. I felt it. I felt another wave of awareness of similarities. I felt how this place matched the plateau of Leng in the writings. Mythologists have placed Leng in Central Asia. But the memory of man, or of his ancestors, is. It may be that some stories have come down from lands. Temples of horror. These are than Asia and than any world we know. A mystics have hinted at a origin for the Pnakotic Manuscripts. They have suggested that the followers of Tsathoggua were to mankind as Tsathoggua itself. Leng, wherever in space. Time it might exist, was not a place I would want to be. I did not like the nearness of a world that had produced. monsters as those Lake had mentioned. At that moment I felt that I had read the hated Necronomicon. I regretted talking with that learned folklorist Wilmarth at the university. This mood made my reaction to the mirage. The mirage appeared from the and opalescent sky. This happened as we got to the mountains. Strated to see the growing waves of the foothills. I had seen mirages in the weeks. Some of them were and as this one. But this one had a and quality of threatening meaning. I shook as the boiling maze of walls. Minarets appeared out of the disturbed ice - vapors above our heads.\n###\nI could not help feeling that they were evil things\u2014mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss. That seething, half-luminous cloud-background held ineffable suggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially spatial; and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness, desolation, and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral world. It was young Danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities of the higher mountain skyline\u2014regularities like clinging fragments of perfect cubes, which Lake had mentioned in his messages, and which indeed justified his comparison with the dream-like suggestions of primordial temple-ruins on cloudy Asian mountain-tops so subtly and strangely painted by Roerich. There was indeed something hauntingly Roerich-like about this whole unearthly continent of mountainous mystery. I had felt it in October when we first caught sight of Victoria Land, and I felt it afresh now. I felt, too, another wave of uneasy consciousness of Archaean mythical resemblances; of how disturbingly this lethal realm corresponded to the evilly famed plateau of Leng in the primal writings. Mythologists have placed Leng in Central Asia; but the racial memory of man\u2014or of his predecessors\u2014is long, and it may well be that certain tales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror earlier than Asia and earlier than any human world we know. A few daring mystics have hinted at a pre-Pleistocene origin for the fragmentary Pnakotic Manuscripts, and have suggested that the devotees of Tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as Tsathoggua itself. Leng, wherever in space or time it might brood, was not a region I would care to be in or near; nor did I relish the proximity of a world that had ever bred such ambiguous and Archaean monstrosities as those Lake had just mentioned. At the moment I felt sorry that I had ever read the abhorred Necronomicon, or talked so much with that unpleasantly erudite folklorist Wilmarth at the university. This mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills. I had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks, some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present sample; but this one had a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism, and I shuddered as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the troubled ice-vapours above our heads."}

Based on this evidence, one could hardly doubt calling the thing an animal. But looking inside showed so many plant-like signs that Lake was left completely lost. It had digestion and circulation. It got rid of waste through the reddish tubes of its starfish-shaped base. Cursorily, one would say its breathing system handled oxygen, not carbon dioxide. There were strange signs of air storage chambers. There were also methdos to switch breathing from the external opening to at least two other fully developed breathing systems. Tehse were gills and pores. Clearly, it was amphibian. It was probably also suited to long periods of hibernation without air. Vocal organs seemed to be present connected to the main breathing system. But they showed oddities that could not be solved right away.

It was definitely known that they had come to bear away the great image of Tych\u00e9 and bring eternal honour to Musides, so their reception by the proxenoi was of great warmth. As the night wore on, a violent storm of wind broke over the crest of Maenalus, and the men from far Syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town. They talked of their illustrious Tyrant, and of the splendour of his capital; and exulted in the glory of the statue which Musides had wrought for him. And then the men of Tegea spoke of the goodness of Musides, and of his heavy grief for his friend; and how not even the coming laurels of art could console him in the absence of Kalos, who might have worn those laurels instead. Of the tree which grew by the tomb, near the head of Kalos, they also spoke. The wind shrieked more horribly, and both the Syracusans and the Arcadians prayed to Aiolos. In the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the Tyrant\u2019s messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor, but the night-wind had done strange things."}

Willett believes the [THING] who wrote the small letters could also use stronger methods. He thinks that. Curwen was left for him to handle, the writer felt capable of finding. The doctor tries hard not to think about what might have happened to them. The next morning, Dr. Willett hurried to the Ward [THING] to be there when the detectives arrived. He felt that Allen 's destruction or imprisonmentmust happen at all costs. He shared this belief with Mr. Ward as they waited for the men. They waited downstairs this time because the uppre floors were starting to be avoided. A strange sickening smell lingered there. Older servants linked this smell to a curse from the missing Curwen portrait. At nine o'clock, the three detectvies arrived and reported everything. Unfortunately, they had not found Brava Tony Gomes as hoped. They also found no trace of Dr. Allen 's origins or current location. However, they discovered many local opinions and facts about the quiet stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet [THING] as somewhat unnatural. There was a widespread belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or fake. This belief was supported by finding scuh a false beard. Dark glasses in his [THIGN] at the fateful bungalow. Mr. Ward could confirm from one [THIGN] call that his voice was deep and hollow, unforgettable. His gaze seemed evil even behind his tinted horn - rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper saw his handwriting during dealings and said it was very strange and cramped. This was confirmed by unclear penciled notes found in his [THING], which the merchant identified. Regarding the vampire rumors from the previous summer, most gossips believed Allen, not Ward, was the real vampire. Statements were also gathered from officials who visited the bungalow after the unpleasant motor truck robbery incident. They sensed less evil from Dr. Allen but saw him as the main figure in the odd shadowy cottage.\n###\nWillett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think. The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present when the detectives arrived. Allen\u2019s destruction or imprisonment\u2014or Curwen\u2019s, if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid\u2014he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait. At nine o\u2019clock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allen\u2019s source or present whereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being, and there was an universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false\u2014a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage."}

Many, like those in the dark passages one had walked through. But after a few feet, glowing mist hid everything. A very thick brass door was open against the left wall of the passage. It was decoarted with strange raised carvings. If closed, it could cut off the whole inner world of light from the rock vaults. The steps were lookde at. For now, it was not dared to try them.

However, the presence of very early life forms is extremely unusual. The limestone formation is clearly Comanchian based on fossils like ventriculites. It is not older. Loose pieces in the hollow space contain many organisms thought to belong to much older times. These include simple fish, mollusks. Corals from as far back as the Silurian. The clear conclusion is that in this region, life from over 300 million years ago shows a strong. Unique connection to life from only thirty million years ago. How long this connection lasted after the Oligocene age, when the cave was saeled, is unknown. In any case, the arrival of severe ice in the Pleistocene about 500,000 years ago must have ended any ancient life forms that had survived logner than usual there. That ice age was very recent compared to the age of the cavity.\n###\nOn the other hand, the prevalence of very early life-forms was singular in the highest degree. Though the limestone formation was, on the evidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites, positively and unmistakably Comanchian and not a particle earlier; the free fragments in the hollow space included a surprising proportion from organisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periods\u2014even rudimentary fishes, molluscs, and corals as remote as the Silurian or Ordovician. The inevitable inference was that in this part of the world there had been a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the life of over 300 million years ago and that of only thirty million years ago. How far this continuity had extended beyond the Oligocene age when the cavern was closed, was of course past all speculation. In any event, the coming of the frightful ice in the Pleistocene some 500,000 years ago\u2014a mere yesterday as compared with the age of this cavity\u2014must have put an end to any of the primal forms which had locally managed to outlive their common terms."}

The place was a very old cemetery. It was so old the signs of great age made them shake. It was in a deep, wet hole. It had thick grass, moss, and strange weeds. There was a bad smell they foolishly linked to rotting stone. Everywhere showed neglect and decay. They felt they. Warren were the first living things to break a deadly silence of hundreds of years. Over the valley's edge, a pale, thin moon lookde through bad air that seemed to come from unknown tombs. By its weak, moving light, they could see many old grave markers, urns, monuments. All were broken, covered in moss, stained by damp. Partly hidden by thick, sickly plants. Their first clear memory of being in this terrible place is stopping with Warren at a worn-down grave. Putting down things they were carrying. They saw they had an electric lantern and two spades. Their companion had a similar lantern and a portable telephone. No one spoke. The place and job seemed known to them. Right away, they took their spades. Began to clear grass, weeds. Dirt from the flat, ancient tomb. After showing the whole surface, which was three big granite slabs, they stepped back to look at the burial place. Warren seemed to think and calculate. Then he went back to the grave. He used his spade to try to lift the slab nearest to a stone ruin that might have been a monument. He did not succeed. He signaled for them to help. Finally their combined strength moved the stone. They lifted it and turned it to one side.\n###\nThe place was an ancient cemetery; so ancient that I trembled at the manifold signs of immemorial years. It was in a deep, damp hollow, overgrown with rank grass, moss, and curious creeping weeds, and filled with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with rotting stone. On every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude, and I seemed haunted by the notion that Warren and I were the first living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries. Over the valley\u2019s rim a wan, waning crescent moon peered through the noisome vapours that seemed to emanate from unheard-of catacombs, and by its feeble, wavering beams I could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs, urns, cenotaphs, and mausolean facades; all crumbling, moss-grown, and moisture-stained, and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation. My first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible necropolis concerns the act of pausing with Warren before a certain half-obliterated sepulchre, and of throwing down some burdens which we seemed to have been carrying. I now observed that I had with me an electric lantern and two spades, whilst my companion was supplied with a similar lantern and a portable telephone outfit. No word was uttered, for the spot and the task seemed known to us; and without delay we seized our spades and commenced to clear away the grass, weeds, and drifted earth from the flat, archaic mortuary. After uncovering the entire surface, which consisted of three immense granite slabs, we stepped back some distance to survey the charnel scene; and Warren appeared to make some mental calculations. Then he returned to the sepulchre, and using his spade as a lever, sought to pry up the slab lying nearest to a stony ruin which may have been a monument in its day. He did not succeed, and motioned to me to come to his assistance. Finally our combined strength loosened the stone, which we raised and tipped to one side."}

It cmae from that urge twoard the northeast. The urge was mixed with dread and memory. I walked under the, burning moon. and I saw, - covered by sand, those blocks. They were left from and forgotten ages. The age. Lurking horror of this place began to crush me. I could not stop thinking of my maddening dreams. I tohught of the stories behind them. I thought of the fears of people. Miners about the desert. Its carved stones. And I walked on as if to some meeting. I was and attacked by thoughts, urges, and memories. I thought of some shapes of the stone lines my son saw from the air. I wondered why they seemed both and. Something was fumbling and rattling at the lock of my memor.y At the time, another force tried to keep the door closed. The night had no wind. The sand curved up and like ocean waves. I had no goal. But I pushed as if with a sense of fate. My dreams rose into the waking world. Each sand - covered stone seemed part of rooms and halls. They wree made of masonry from before humans. They were carved and marked with symbols. I knew these symbols from years of habit as a mind of the Great Race. At times I imagined I saw those - knowing cone - shaped horrors moving at their tasks. I was to look down. I feared I would find myself looking like one of them. I saw the sand - covered blocks as the rooms. I saw the, burning moon as the lamps of glowing crystal. I saw the desert as the waving ferns. Cycads outside the windows. I was and dreaming at the time. I do not know how or how I walked. I do not know in what direction I moved. This was when I saw the pile of blocks uncovered by the day 's wind. It was the group in one place I had seen. It impressed me that the visions of ages faded. there were the desert. The moon. The pieces of a past no one could guess.\n###\nNerves on edge, and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable, dread-mingled, pseudo-mnemonic urge toward the northeast, I plodded on beneath the evil, burning moon. Here and there I saw, half-shrouded by the sand, those primal Cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons. The incalculable age and brooding horror of this monstrous waste began to oppress me as never before, and I could not keep from thinking of my maddening dreams, of the frightful legends which lay behind them, and of the present fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stones. And yet I plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvous\u2014more and more assailed by bewildering fancies, compulsions, and pseudo-memories. I thought of some of the possible contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air, and wondered why they seemed at once so ominous and so familiar. Something was fumbling and rattling at the latch of my recollection, while another unknown force sought to keep the portal barred. The night was windless, and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves of the sea. I had no goal, but somehow ploughed along as if with fate-bound assurance. My dreams welled up into the waking world, so that each sand-embedded megalith seemed part of endless rooms and corridors of pre-human masonry, carved and hieroglyphed with symbols that I knew too well from years of custom as a captive mind of the Great Race. At moments I fancied I saw those omniscient conical horrors moving about at their accustomed tasks, and I feared to look down lest I find myself one with them in aspect. Yet all the while I saw the sand-covered blocks as well as the rooms and corridors; the evil, burning moon as well as the lamps of luminous crystal; the endless desert as well as the waving ferns and cycads beyond the windows. I was awake and dreaming at the same time. I do not know how long or how far\u2014or indeed, in just what direction\u2014I had walked when I first spied the heap of blocks bared by the day\u2019s wind. It was the largest group in one place that I had so far seen, and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away. Again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an unguessed past."}

Carter was placed near the front of the group next to Pickman. A double line of riderless night-gaunts went first as scouts. At a sharp meep from Pickman, the whole scary army rose like a dream cloud. They flew above the broken columns and sphinxes of Sarkomand. They went higher and higher. They passed the black cliff behind the town. They saw the flat ladn at the edge of Leng. The black group flew still higher. flat land looked below it. They moved north over the windy plain of horror. It could be seen that the circle of rough stone blocks. The windowless building were visible again. It is known that building held the silk-masked evil thing from which escape was barely achieved. This time they did not land. The army flew like bats over the land. They passed the weak fires of the unhealthy stone villages up. They did not stop to watch the scik twisting movements of the hoofed, horned almost-human things that always dance. Play music there. Once a shantak-bird was seen flying over the plain.

At a brisk meep from Pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial Sarkomand; higher and higher, till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared, and the cold, sterile table-land of Leng\u2019s outskirts laid open to sight. Still higher flew the black host, till even this table-land grew small beneath them; and as they worked northward over the windswept plateau of horror Carter saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful silken-masked blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped. This time no descent was made as the army swept bat-like over the sterile landscape, passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone villages at a great altitude, and pausing not at all to mark the morbid twistings of the hooved, horned almost-humans that dance and pipe eternally therein. Once they saw a shantak-bird flying low over the plain, but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panic."}

After that, I let go of all ties to real, solid, and old things. I entered a strange, quiet world where the thin, ribbon-like lace moved. Curved with a will of its own. It moved among the empty holes and mostly unused flaps. Except for the sound of the pull. The soft movement of the few lonley fibers we passed now. Then, the only thing I heard was the quiet, sneaky whisper of odd tensions. These came from many hidden pressures in the shadowy folds.\n###\nThe quaint, sightly knot of the initial loop, formed in less than a moment, was my last link with that foot which man can definitely call his own by virtue of comfort and complete support. After that I cast off all allegiance to immediate, tangible, and time-touched things, and entered a fantastic world of hushed unreality in which the narrow, ribbon-like lace wove and crossed and curved with an almost sentient and purposeful caprice amidst the tenantless eyelets and half-deserted tongues. Except for the sound of the pull, and the faint stir of the few lonely fibers we passed at infrequent intervals, the only thing that reached my senses was the gurgling, insidious whisper of strange tensions from numberless hidden stresses in the shadowy folds."}

Joseph Curwen, as shown by the scattered stories in what Ward haerd. Found, was a very surrpising, puzzling. Secretly frightening person. He ran away from Salem to Providence at the start of big witchcraft scare. Providence was common safe place for the odd, the free, and those who disagreed. He feared being accused because of his lonely habits and strange chemical or alchemy tests. He was a plain-looking man about thirty years olld. He soon met the requirements to become a free citizen of Providence. After that, he bought a home plot just north of Gregory Dexter's pplace, neaar the bottom of Olney Street. His house was built on Stampers' Hill west of the Town Street, in what llater became Olney Court. In 1761, he replaced this hosue with a bigger one on the same spot, which is still there today.\n###\nJoseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible individual.

He was miles below the world he knew, facing another world of He felt dread at the extreme age of the place and its spirit. A ancienntess seemed to look dwon from the first stones. Rock-cut temples in nameless city. The most recent of the amazing maps in the frescoes showed oceans. Continents humnas have forgotten. Only here and there was a vaguely familiar shpae.

Not even the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes, miles below the world I knew and faced by another world of eerie light and mist, could match the lethal dread I felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul. An ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from the primal stones and rock-hewn temples in the nameless city, while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and continents that man has forgotten, with only here and there some vaguely familiar outline. Of what could have happened in the geological aeons since the paintings ceased and the death-hating race resentfully succumbed to decay, no man might say. Life had once teemed in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond; now I was alone with vivid relics, and I trembled to think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent and deserted vigil."}

However, the observer kept a careful record of the very dreams. These dreams came to him often and vividly. He argued that such a record had real value as a psychological document.

It was noted that the amounts of different chemicals on the shelves suggested young Ward's main interest was in a part of organic chemistry. Overall, little could be learned from the collection of scientific items. It included a dissecting table that looked gruesome. So the room was rather disappointing. Among the books was an old torn copy of Borellus. It was in black-letter print. It is strangely interesting to observe that Ward had underlined the same passage. The marking of this passage had troubled Mr. Merritt long ago. This was at Curwen's farmhouse more than one hundred and fifty years before. That older copy must have been destroyed. It was lost with the rest of Curwen's occult library in the final raid. Three archways led out of the laboratory. These were examined one by one. From a quick survey, it could be seen that two led only to small storerooms. But these were checked carefully. The piles of coffins in different states of damage weer noted. One shudders strongly at two or three coffin-plates which could be read. Much clothing was also stored in these rooms. There were several new boxes nailed tightly shut. These were not investigated. Perhaps most interesting were some odd pieces. They were judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen's laboratory equipment. These had been damaged by the raiders. But they were still partly recognizable as chemical equipment frmo the Georgian period.\n###\nAfter lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Ward\u2019s dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwen\u2019s farmhouse more than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwen\u2019s occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen\u2019s laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period."}

The general thought zoogs would likely hold a deep grudge against him for ruining their war plans. Randolph Carter accepted this offer with thanks. He was grateful for the safety it provided. He also enjoyed the elegant company of cats. Surrounded by a cheerful. Playful group of cats, relaxed after their successful duty, Randolph Carter walked with honor through that magical, glowing [THING] of giant trees. He spoke about his search with the old general and his grandson. Meanwhile, other cats in the group plyaed wild games. Chased fallen leaves blown by the [THING] among the ancient fungi. The old [THING] said he had heard much about the unknown Kadath in the cold wasteland. But he did not know its location. As for the wonderful sunset [THING], he had not even heard of it. Yet he would happily pass any news to Carter if he learned more later. He gave the seeker some very useful passwords among the cats of dreamland. He especially reocmmended the seeker to the old chief of the cats in Celepha\u00efs, where he was heading. That old [THING], already somewhat knwon to Carter, was a respected Maltese. He would be quite influential in any dealings. Dawn arrived as they reached the correct edge of the [THING]. Carter said a sad goodbye to his friends. The young sub - lieutenant he had met as a small kitten wanted to follow him. But the old general would not allow it. That strict leader insisted the path of duty was with the tribe and the army. So Carter began his journey alone across the golden fields. These fields stretched mysteriously beside a [THING] lined with willwo tree.s The cats returned into the [TIHNG]. Well did the traveler know those [THING] lands that lie between the [THING]. Happily, he followed the singing [THIGN] Oukranos that showed his path. The [THING] rose higher over gentel slopes of small woods and grass. It brightened the colors of the thousands of flowers covering every hill and small valley. A blessed mits covers all this area. This place holds a little more sunlight than other plcaes hold. It also holds a little more of the summer 's buzzing music of birds and bees. So [THING] walk through it as through a fairy place. They feel a greater joy and wonder than they ever remember feeling later.\n###\nThe old cat general now offered Carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach, deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise. This offer he welcomed with gratitude; not only for the safety it afforded, but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats. So in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment, relaxed after the successful performance of its duty, Randolph Carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees, talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of the primeval floor. And the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown Kadath in the cold waste, but did not know where it was. As for the marvellous sunset city, he had not even heard of that, but would gladly relay to Carter anything he might later learn. He gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland, and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in Celepha\u00efs, whither he was bound. That old cat, already slightly known to Carter, was a dignified Maltese; and would prove highly influential in any transaction. It was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood, and Carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell. The young sub-lieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it, but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army. So Carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willow-fringed river, and the cats went back into the wood. Well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood and the Cerenerian Sea, and blithely did he follow the singing river Oukranos that marked his course. The sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn, and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dingle. A blessed haze lies upon all this region, wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold, and a little more of the summer\u2019s humming music of birds and bees; so that men walk through it as through a faery place, and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember."}

This link could wake him to older and future lives in forgotten dimensions. It cuold tie him to the stars. To the endless spaces. Times beyond them. You ask me to explain why I fear a current of cool air. They ask why I shiver more than others when entering a cold romo. They ask why I feel sick. Repelled when evening's chill spreads through a warm autumn day. Some say I react to clod as others do to bad smell. I do not deny this impression. What I will do is tell the most horrible event I eevr experienced. You can judge if this explains my peculiar fear. It is wrong to think horror only exists wtih darkness, silence, and being alone. I found it in the bright light of atfernoon. I found it in the noise of a big city. I found it in a crowded, shabby, and ordinary boarding house. A plain landlady and two strong men were with me. In the spring of 1923, I had some dull. Poorly paid magazine work in New York. I could not pay high rent. So I moved from one cheap boarding house to another. I looked for a room that was decently clean, had bearable furniture. Was very low cost. I soon saw I only had a choice between bad options. But after a while, I found a house on West Fourteenth Street. It disgusted me much less than the others I had tried. The building was a four-story brownstone mansion. It seemed to be from the late 1840s. It had woodwork and marble. Their stained and dirty beauty suggested a fall from a high level of tasteful wealth. The rooms were large and high. They had ugly wallpaper and very fancy plaster moldings. sad musty smell and a hnit of strange cooking lingered. But the floors were clean. The bed sheets were fairly normal. The hot water was not too often cold or shut off. I began to see it as a bearable place to stay dormant until I could really live again.\n###\nIt might be in the visible world, yet it might be only in his mind and soul. Perhaps he held within his own half-explored brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions; which would bind him to the stars, and to the infinities and eternities beyond them. You ask me to explain why I am afraid of a draught of cool air; why I shiver more than others upon entering a cold room, and seem nauseated and repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a mild autumn day. There are those who say I respond to cold as others do to a bad odour, and I am the last to deny the impression. What I will do is to relate the most horrible circumstance I ever encountered, and leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable explanation of my peculiarity. It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness, silence, and solitude. I found it in the glare of mid-afternoon, in the clangour of a metropolis, and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace rooming-house with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side. In the spring of 1923 I had secured some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of New York; and being unable to pay any substantial rent, began drifting from one cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might combine the qualities of decent cleanliness, endurable furnishings, and very reasonable price. It soon developed that I had only a choice between different evils, but after a time I came upon a house in West Fourteenth Street which disgusted me much less than the others I had sampled. The place was a four-story mansion of brownstone, dating apparently from the late forties, and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of tasteful opulence. In the rooms, large and lofty, and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices, there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the floors were clean, the linen tolerably regular, and the hot water not too often cold or turned off, so that I came to regard it as at least a bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again."}

My mind was dazed and confused. Yet it still held a desperate need for light. Not even the strange wonder that had happened could stop me. I did not know or care if my experience was madness, a dream, or magic. I was set on seeing brightness and joy at any price. I did not know who I was or what I was. I did not know what was around me. As I kept stumbling forward, I flet a kind of scary hidden memory. This memoory made my path not completely random. I went under an arch and left the area of slabs and columns. I wandered through open land. Sometimes I followed the visiblee road. Sometimes I left it in a curious way to walk across meadows.

I knew not who I was or what I was, or what my surroundings might be; though as I continued to stumble along I became conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous. I passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns, and wandered through the open country; sometimes following the visible road, but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road.

But tended to be split into halves. There were some rat tracks leading out of a hole. into it. confusion and the fear of madness tortured Gilman as he stumbled to the door. He saw there were no prints. The he remembered of his dream the he felt. It added to his despair to hear Joe Mazurewicz singing two floors. He went to Elwood \u2019s room and woke his - sleeping host. He began tellign how he had found himself. But Elwood could form no idea of what might have happened. What could have happened? How did he get to his room without making tracks in the hall? How did the, furniture - prints get mixed with his in the room? These were beyond guessing. there were those, bruised marks on his thorat, as if he had tried to choke himself. He put his hands up to them but found they did not. They were talking Desrochers came in to say he had heard a clattering in the hours. No, there had been no one on the stairs after midnight. But before midnight he had heard footsteps in the attic. And he had heard descending steps he did not like. He added it was a time of year for Arkham. The man had be to wear the crucifix Joe Mazurewicz had given him. the daytime was not. For after dawn there had been sounds in the house. a, cry cut off. Gilman went to classes that morning. Was to focus on his studies. A mood of worry and waiting had taken him. He seemed to be waiting for the fall of some destroying blow.\n###\nFor the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy, but he knew at least that he must have been sleep-walking. Elwood had been lost too deeply in slumber to hear and stop him. On the floor were confused muddy prints, but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door. The more Gilman looked at them, the more peculiar they seemed; for in addition to those he could recognise as his there were some smaller, almost round markings\u2014such as the legs of a large chair or table might make, except that most of them tended to be divided into halves. There were also some curious muddy rat-tracks leading out of a fresh hole and back into it again. Utter bewilderment and the fear of madness racked Gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there were no muddy prints outside. The more he remembered of his hideous dream the more terrified he felt, and it added to his desperation to hear Joe Mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors below. Descending to Elwood\u2019s room he roused his still-sleeping host and began telling of how he had found himself, but Elwood could form no idea of what might really have happened. Where Gilman could have been, how he got back to his room without making tracks in the hall, and how the muddy, furniture-like prints came to be mixed with his in the garret chamber, were wholly beyond conjecture. Then there were those dark, livid marks on his throat, as if he had tried to strangle himself. He put his hands up to them, but found that they did not even approximately fit. While they were talking Desrochers dropped in to say that he had heard a terrific clattering overhead in the dark small hours. No, there had been no one on the stairs after midnight\u2014though just before midnight he had heard faint footfalls in the garret, and cautiously descending steps he did not like. It was, he added, a very bad time of year for Arkham. The young gentleman had better be sure to wear the crucifix Joe Mazurewicz had given him. Even the daytime was not safe, for after dawn there had been strange sounds in the house\u2014especially a thin, childish wail hastily choked off. Gilman mechanically attended classes that morning, but was wholly unable to fix his mind on his studies. A mood of hideous apprehension and expectancy had seized him, and he seemed to be awaiting the fall of some annihilating blow."}

We had many facts to connect. We also had a second eyewitness to deny any charge that jealousy. Spite had driven our imagination. We chose Capt as our first confidant. He was James Mathewson of the Enterprise. He knew us well enough not to doubt our truthfulness. He was also influential enough in town to be listened to wtih respect. The talk happened in an upper room of Sabin's Tavern near the docks. Smith was there to confirm almost every statement. It could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was very impressed. Like almost everyone else in town, he had his own suspicions about Joseph Curwen. So, he only needed this confirmation and more data to be completely convinced. At the end of the meeting, he was very serious. He told us two younger men to keep strict silence. He said he would pass the information separately to about ten of the most learned. Important citizens of Providence. He would find out their views and follow any advice they might offer. Secrecy would probably be needed in any case. This was not something the town police or militia colud handle. Above all, the easily excited crowd must not know. This was to prevent a repeat of the Salem panic from less than a century before. That panic first brought Curwen here.\n###\nBy the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabin\u2019s Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought Curwen hither."}

The cases they took proved to contain things when opened. that the matter could not be kept among the underworld. The thieves buried what they found. But when the State Police heard about it, a search was conducted. A arrested person agreed to guide a group of police officers to spot. He was promised he would not be prosecuted for any charge. In that hiding place, a and thing was found. It would not be for the. sense of behavior if the public knew what that group uncovered. There was no mistaking it, by these officers who were not. Telegrams to Washington followed with speed. The cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow. State and Federal officials paid him a and visit. They found him and worried with his two companions. They received from him what seemed to be a explanation and proof of innocence. He had needed specimens for a research program. Anyone who had known him in the deacde could prove the depth. Genuineness of this research. He had ordered required kind and number from agencies. He had thought these agencies were as things can be. He knew nothing about the identity of the specimens. He was shocked when the inspectors hinted at the effect on feeling. Knowledge of the matter would produce this effect. In this statement, he was supported by his colleague Dr. Allen. Dr. Allen 's voice carried conviction than his tones. in the end, the officials took no action. They wrote down the New York name and address which Ward gave them. This was a basis for a search which found nothing. It is to add that the specimens were. returned to their places. The public will know of their disturbance. On February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward. He considers it of importance. He has argued about it with Dr. Lyman.\n###\nFor the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State Police got wind of the matter a careful search was made. A recently arrested vagrant, under promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge, at last consented to guide a party of troopers to the spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and shameful thing. It would not be well for the national\u2014or even the international\u2014sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party. There was no mistaking it, even by these far from studious officers; and telegrams to Washington ensued with feverish rapidity. The cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow, and State and Federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call. They found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions, and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence. He had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could prove, and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be. Of the identity of the specimens he had known absolutely nothing, and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce. In this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague Dr. Allen, whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones; so that in the end the officials took no action, but carefully set down the New York name and address which Ward gave them as a basis for a search which came to nothing. It is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places, and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbance. On February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward which he considers of extraordinary importance, and about which he has frequently quarrelled with Dr. Lyman."}

But he assured his questioners that the and man would return when needed. In paying off the Brava who resitsed all questioning by the visitors. In closing the bungalow which seemed to hold secrets, Ward showed no sign of nervousness. He had a noticed tendency to puase as though listening for something. He was motivated by a acceptance. It was as if his removal were the passing incident. It would cause the trouble if made and settled and for all. It was that he trusted to his sharpness of mind to overcome all the embarrassments. These embarrassments had been caused by his memory, his lost voice. It was agreed that his mother was not to be told of the change. His father would supply notes in his name.

In paying off the stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets, Ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed; the slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate neural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and which made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the \u201cwitch markings\u201d reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and which read: \u201cMr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.\u201d Ward\u2019s face, too, troubled him horribly, till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. For above the young man\u2019s right eye was something which he had never previously noticed\u2014a small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careers."}

The announcement was in the Eagle. It announced Robert Suydam's engagement to Miss Cornelia Gerritsen of Bayside. She was a young woman from a good family. She was a distant relative of the older man who would be her husband. The other event was a police raid. City police raided the dance-hall church. This happened after a report. The report said a kidnapped child's face was seen. It was seen for a moment at a basement window. Malone took part in this raid. He examined the place carefully once inside. Nothing was found. In fact, the building was completely empty when they entered. But sensitive Celt felt uneasy. Many things inside the building bothered him vaguely. There were crudely painted panels he disliked. The panels showed sacred faces. These faces had strangely worldly and mocking expressions. The panels sometimes showed things that were improper. Even a person with no sepcial training in art would find them offensive. Also, he did not like the Greek inscription. It was on the wall above the pulpit. It was an ancient incantation. He had once come across it during his Dublin college dyas. Translated literally, it read, When he read this, he shuddered. He vaguely remembreed the deep, cracked organ notes. He thought he had heard these notes under the church on some nights. He shuddered again at the rust. The rust was around the edge of a metal basin. The basin stood on the altar. He paused nervously. His nose seemed to catch a strange and horrible smell. The smell came from somewhere nearby. The memory of that organ haunted him. He searhced the basement very thoroughly befroe leaving. The place was very unpleasant to him. But he wondered. Were the disrespectful panels and inscriptions just crude works? Could they be just the work of ignoarnt people? By the tiem of Suydam's wedding, the kidnappings had become a big news story. Most victims were young children from the poorest families. The growing nubmer of missing children made people very angry. Journals demanded police action. Once again, the Butler Street station sent its officers over Red Hook. They were looking for clues, evidence, and criminals. Malone was happy to be working on the case again. He felt proud after a raid. The raid was on one of Suydam's Parker Place houses. No stolen child was found there. This was despite stories of screams. It was despite a red sash found in the alley. But the paintings and rough writings were on the peeling walls of most rooms. There was also a simple chemical lab in the attic. All these things made the detective sure. He believed he was following a lead to something very big.\n###\nThen two incidents occurred\u2014wide enough apart, but both of intense interest in the case as Malone envisaged it. One was a quiet announcement in the Eagle of Robert Suydam\u2019s engagement to Miss Cornelia Gerritsen of Bayside, a young woman of excellent position, and distantly related to the elderly bridegroom-elect; whilst the other was a raid on the dance-hall church by city police, after a report that the face of a kidnapped child had been seen for a second at one of the basement windows. Malone had participated in this raid, and studied the place with much care when inside. Nothing was found\u2014in fact, the building was entirely deserted when visited\u2014but the sensitive Celt was vaguely disturbed by many things about the interior. There were crudely painted panels he did not like\u2014panels which depicted sacred faces with peculiarly worldly and sardonic expressions, and which occasionally took liberties that even a layman\u2019s sense of decorum could scarcely countenance. Then, too, he did not relish the Greek inscription on the wall above the pulpit; an ancient incantation which he had once stumbled upon in Dublin college days, and which read, literally translated, When he read this he shuddered, and thought vaguely of the cracked bass organ notes he fancied he had heard beneath the church on certain nights. He shuddered again at the rust around the rim of a metal basin which stood on the altar, and paused nervously when his nostrils seemed to detect a curious and ghastly stench from somewhere in the neighbourhood. That organ memory haunted him, and he explored the basement with particular assiduity before he left. The place was very hateful to him; yet after all, were the blasphemous panels and inscriptions more than mere crudities perpetrated by the ignorant? By the time of Suydam\u2019s wedding the kidnapping epidemic had become a popular newspaper scandal. Most of the victims were young children of the lowest classes, but the increasing number of disappearances had worked up a sentiment of the strongest fury. Journals clamoured for action from the police, and once more the Butler Street station sent its men over Red Hook for clues, discoveries, and criminals. Malone was glad to be on the trail again, and took pride in a raid on one of Suydam\u2019s Parker Place houses. There, indeed, no stolen child was found, despite the tales of screams and the red sash picked up in the areaway; but the paintings and rough inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of the rooms, and the primitive chemical laboratory in the attic, all helped to convince the detective that he was on the track of something tremendous."}

Among the trash that fell through the old slanted ceiling were several things. These things made the workers stop and call the police. Later the police then called the coroner and several university professors. There were bones. The bones were badly crushed and broken, but clearly human. Theri clearly modern age was puzzling. It did not match the very old time when the only place they could have been hidden was sealed. That place was the low, slanted-floor attic above.

But he still wished he had made the attempt. Those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then. He knew he was not in the halls leading outside.

True, they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have done him much good, but he wished none the less he had made the attempt. Those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then, and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside. In time he became quite sure he was not followed, and slackened his pace somewhat; but scarce had he breathed in half-relief when a new peril beset him. His lamp was waning, and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or guidance. When the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark, and prayed to the Great Ones for such help as they might afford. At times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down, and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist. The farther he went the damper it seemed to be, and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least. He believed, though, that his general course was down; and the vault-like smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in Leng\u2019s unwholesome table-land. But there was not any warning of the thing which came at last; only the thing itself with its terror and shock and breath-taking chaos. One moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place, and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been well-nigh vertical. Of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure, but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy. Then he realised he was still, with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him. All around were crumbling walls and broken columns, and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots. Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes, and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come."}

Dimensions was not to be thought about. Two of the things that moved less randomly seemed to take notice. One was a rather large group of shiny, oval bubbles. The other was a much smaller many-sided shape with unknown colors and fast-changing surface angles. Floated ahead as positions changed among the giant crystals, mazes, groups of cubes.

It appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place, and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great. The corridor ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins, but we could see much through it even before we emerged. Beyond there stretched a prodigious round space\u2014fully 200 feet in diameter\u2014strown with debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to cross. The walls were\u2014in available spaces\u2014boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic proportions; and displayed, despite the destructive weathering caused by the openness of the spot, an artistic splendour far beyond anything we had encountered before. The littered floor was quite heavily glaciated, and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depth."}

He stopped at a farmhouse to get a cup of water. All the dogs barked in fear at the zoogs that moved through the grass behind him. At another house, where people were, he asekd questions about the gods. He asked if they danced upon Lerion. His wife made the Sign. Told him the way to Nir. At noon, he walked through the one street of Nir. He had visited this place. It was the he had traveled in this direction., he reached the stone bridge across the Skai. When the bridge was built thirteen hundred years, the builders had sealed a living sacrifice inside its suppotr pillar. On the side of, cats were seen. All the cats arched their backs at the zoogs that followed him. This showed that Ulthar was. In Ulthar, an and law said no person may kill a cat. The areas Ulthar were. There were cottages and fenced farms. The town itself was. It had rofos and floors that hung over the streets. There were chimneys and streets. One could see cobblestones whenever the cats left space. Carter moved because the cats were scattered by the - seen zoogs. He went to the Temple of the Elder Ones. It was said the priests and records were kept. that stone tower covered with ivyhe looked for the priest Atal. This priest had climbed the peak Hatheg - Kla in the stony desert. Had come. Atal sat on an ivory platform in decorated shrine at the top of the temple. He was three hundred years. But his mind and memory were. From him, Carter learned things about the gods., he learned they are the gods of earth. They rule our dreamland and have no power or home. Atal said they might listen to a person 's prayer if they were in a mood. One must not think of climbing to their onyx fortress on top of Kadath in the desert. It was that no person knew where Kadath towers stand. The results of climbing it would be. Atal 's companion Barzai the Wise had been pulled screaming into the sky for climbing the peak of Hathge - Kla.\n###\nOnce he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water, and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind. At another house, where people were stirring, he asked questions about the gods, and whether they danced often upon Lerion; but the farmer and his wife would only make the Elder Sign and tell him the way to Nir and Ulthar. At noon he walked through the one broad high street of Nir, which he had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the Skai, into whose central pier the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it thirteen-hundred years before. Once on the other side, the frequent presence of cats (who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs) revealed the near neighbourhood of Ulthar; for in Ulthar, according to an ancient and significant law, no man may kill a cat. Very pleasant were the suburbs of Ulthar, with their little green cottages and neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself, with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough. Carter, the cats being somewhat dispersed by the half-seen zoogs, picked his way directly to the modest Temple of the Elder Ones where the priests and old records were said to be; and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied stone\u2014which crowns Ulthar\u2019s highest hill\u2014he sought out the patriarch Atal, who had been up the forbidden peak Hatheg-Kla in the stony desert and had come down again alive. Atal, seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple, was fully three centuries old; but still very keen of mind and memory. From him Carter learned many things about the gods, but mainly that they are indeed only earth\u2019s gods, ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere. They might, Atal said, heed a man\u2019s prayer if in good humour; but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop Kadath in the cold waste. It was lucky that no man knew where Kadath towers, for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave. Atal\u2019s companion Barzai the Wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of Hatheg-Kla."}

He did not like the idea of going to the world of the giants. He did not want to risk that tower with its steps leading to the forest. But he felt he might have to try this if nothing worked. He did not dare to cross the past the temple without help. The priest 's messengers would be. At the end of the journey, there would be the flying creatures. things to face. If he could get a boat, he might sail to the city past the. rock in the sea. The paintings in the temple maze showed taht this place is not from the stone docks of the port city. But finding a boat in this - deserted city was not. It did not seem that he could build one. These were his thoughts when a feeling began to press on his mind. All this time, the widht of the city had stretched before him. It had its broken pillars and crumbling gates topped with statues. It had stones. winged lions against the glow of the shining night clouds. he saw. To the right a glow that the clouds could not cause. He knew he was not in the slience of that city. The glow rose and fell. It flickered with a color that did not make the watcher feel. When he crept, down the street. Through some gaps between walls, he saw it was a campfire near the docks. shapes were gathered around it. A smell hung over everything. Beyond was the sound of the harbor water. A ship was riding at anchor. He stopped in terror when he saw that the ship was one of the feared ships from the moon., as he was about to creep from that flame, he saw movement among the shapes. He heard a and sound. It was the cry of a ghoul. In a moment, it had grown into a chorus of pain. as he was in the shadow of the ruins, he let his curiosity overcome his fear. He crept of going.\n###\nHe did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of Koth with its Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood, yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed. Over Leng\u2019s plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided; for the high-priest\u2019s emissaries must be many, while at the journey\u2019s end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with. If he could get a boat he might sail back to Inganok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea, for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from Sarkomand\u2019s basalt quays. But to find a boat in this aeon-deserted city was no probable thing, and it did not appear likely that he could ever make one. Such were the thoughts of Randolph Carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind. All this while there had stretched before him the great corpse-like width of fabled Sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds. Now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for, and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city. The glow rose and fell fitfully, flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher. And when he crept closer, down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls, he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it, and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all. Beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor, and Carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moon. Then, just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame, he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound. It was the frightened meeping of a ghoul, and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish. Secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins, Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear, and crept forward again instead of retreating."}

The picture faced up in a disgusting way. The old man whispered the words \"more the same.\" A small splattering sound was heard. Something appeared on the yellwo paper of the book. One might think of rain and a leaky roof. But rain is not red. On the butcher's shop of the Anzique cannibals, a smlal red splatter shone in a striking way. It made the horror of the picture more vivid. The old man saw it. He stopped whispering before a look of horror required it. He saw it. Looked quickly at the floor of the room he left an hour before. The look was followed. There was seen just above them on the old ceiling's loose plaster a large, uneven spot of wet, red color. It seemed to spread as it was wathced. No scream or movement happened. The eyes were only closed. A moment later came the greatest thunderbolt of all. It destroyed that cursed house of terrible secrets. It brought forgetfulness. Only this forgetfulness preserved the mind.\n###\nThe open book lay flat between us, with the picture staring repulsively upward.

I thought of the rain and of a leaky roof, but rain is not red.

I followed his glance, and beheld just above us on the loose plaster of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot of wet crimson which seemed to spread even as I viewed it.

It was joined to a force which would have made him a genius.\n###\nHe bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character. In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent. Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Ward\u2019s family physician, affirms that the patient\u2019s gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youth\u2019s mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement."}

On the west cliff, the attackers were destroyed. On the east cliff. Where the leader of the moon - beast group seemed to be, the ghouls had not done. They were pulling to the slopes of the point. Pickman had ordered help for this front from the group in the town. These had helped a lot in the parts of the fight., when the battle was, the winning survivors hurried to help their - pressed friends. This turned the situation. Pushed the attackers along the ridge of the cliff. The - humans were all killed by this time. The of toad - horrors fought with the spears held in their. The time for jvaelins was.

The cliffs could not be climbed except where the monsters had landed. none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battle line. Some were killed by javelins from the enemy ship or from the moon - beasts. But a lived to be saved. When the safety of the land groups seemed, Carter 's ship went out between the cliffs. It chased the enemy ship out to sea. It stopped to save ghouls as were on the rocks. swimming in the ocean. moon - beasst washed on rocks or reefs were dealt with., the moon - beasts ' ship being. The attacking land army in one place, Carter landed a - force on the cliff behind the enemy. After that, the fight was. Attacked from both sides, the strugglers were cut. Pushed into the sea. By evening, the leaders agreed the island was of them. The enemy ship,, had gone. It was decided rock had be left before any group of moon horrors could be gathered. Sent against the winners.\n###\nFor half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky, till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated. On the east cliff, however, where the leader of the moon-beast party appeared to be present, the ghouls had not fared so well; and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper. Pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from the party in the town, and these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat. Then, when the western battle was over, the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their hard-pressed fellows; turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland. The almost-humans were by this time all slain, but the last of the toad-like horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws. The time for javelins was now nearly past, and the fight became a hand-to-hand contest of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridge. As fury and recklessness increased, the number falling into the sea became very great. Those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen bubblers, but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks, while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moon-beasts. The cliffs were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked, so that none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battle-line. Some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moon-beasts above, but a few survived to be rescued. When the security of the land parties seemed assured, Carter\u2019s galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea; pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean. Several moon-beasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of the way. Finally, the moon-beasts\u2019 galley being safely in the distance and the invading land army concentrated in one place, Carter landed a considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemy\u2019s rear; after which the fight was short-lived indeed. Attacked from both sides, the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea, till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them. The hostile galley, meanwhile, had disappeared; and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victors."}

Led by some unclear hearing instinct, the confused visitor now looked curiously at the empty reading tables. He wanted to feel what kind of quiet filled the bookshelves. The library's silence was clearly and stiffly layered. One could tell at a quick look the nature. At least the type of quiet that had fallen. This time, the observer was amazed to fidn that nothing of a grave. Tomb-like quality, beyond what was seen before, was main. This new quiet was all a modern kind. There was a rustling of pages, a scratching of pens, a moving of chairs, murmurs of focus, whispered talk.s Some soft, regular breaths. It was a very odd change from the library's usual funeral-like silence. The listener stopped in a growing swirl of confusion and a swallowing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very sharp feeling. It almost clawed at his ears as he tried to hear just what was wrong around hi.m Something was indeed wrong, and in a way you could feel and in the mood.

The library\u2019s silence was plainly and rigidly stratified, so that one might tell at a glance the nature or at least the kind of hush which had descended. On this occasion the observer was astonished to find that nothing of the sepulchral or the tomblike, beyond what had been previously noted, was predominant. This new stillness was all a modern variety; a rustling of pages, a scratching of pens, a shifting of chairs, murmurs of concentration, whispered consultations, and certain faint, rhythmic exhalations. It was a very curious shift from the library\u2019s customary funereal silence, and the listener paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his ears as he strove to hear just what was amiss around him. Something was indeed amiss, and tangibly as well as atmospherically so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was aberrant, and at last it dawned upon him what it was."}

We were worried by what seemed to be a slow hardening of its crust. This was not only on the surface. Also inside the part, both outer. Once we imagined that a grainy texture entered the loaf's inside when morning shone on it. Another time we thought we heard a faint crumbling or cracking sound not far away. Each time we looked, we found nothing certain. We started to think the changes were only in our perception. Thsi was the same oddly sharp perception that still made us sense the faint, smell we thought we noticed in the pantry. The dried loaf now sat on a plate in our kitchen. Sometimes we looked at it under harsh of electric bulbs in front of it. We read much in cooking records about its qualities. We read about how starch going back to a solid state related to the conditions it represented. We were disturbed by what we read.

We kept it as a specimen; devoid of freshness, isolated, and without proper storage in a corner of an antiquated cupboard on a high and seldom-used shelf; so that its form was seldom disturbed by the touch of the consumer. Now, however, we were troubled by what seemed to be a gradual hardening of its crust, not only across the surface but within the crumb also, outer as well as inner. Once we fancied that a peculiar, granular consistency invaded the loaf\u2019s interior when the morning light was shining upon it, and another time we thought we perceived a faint crumbling or fracturing sound not far off. On each occasion examination revealed nothing conclusive, and we began to ascribe the alterations to perception alone\u2014that same curiously heightened perception which still prolonged in our senses the faint, dry aroma we thought we had detected in the larder\u2019s gloom. The desiccated loaf now reposed upon a plate in our kitchen, and sometimes we observed it under the stark illumination of electric bulbs before it. We read much in culinary annals about its properties, and about the relation of starch retrogradation to the states it symbolised; and were unsettled by what we read. Then revulsion came."}

The wide open Atlantic could be seen to the left. The narrow road begna to go up steeply. A strange unease was felt looking at the lonely hilltop ahead. There the worn road met the sky. It seemed as if the bus would keep going up. It would leave the normal earth completely. It would join the unknown secrets of the high air and mysterious sky. The smell of the sea seemed threatening.

This depended on what the top soil or rock suggested. We would only drill on land that was exposed or almost exposed. This land was slopes and ridges. This was because a mile or two miles of solid ice covered the lower ground. We could not use up drilling depth on large areas of just ice. However, Pabodie had made a plan. The plan was to put many copper electrodes into thick groups of drill holes. Then, use current from a gasoline dynamo to melt small areas of ice. We could only test this plan on an expedition like ours. The upcoming Starkweather-Moore Expedition wants to use this plan. They want to do this eevn though we have given warnings since we came back from Antarctica.\n###\nOur borings, of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock, were to be confined to exposed or nearly exposed land surfaces\u2014these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or two-mile thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels.

Far That depe cut went back into the solid cliff. Its lower parts opened deep into the earth. It was not a human quarry. The curved sides had large square marks yards wide. These showed the siez of blocks once cut by unknown hands and tools. High Large ravens flapped and croaked over its rough edge. Faint whirring sounds came from unseen depths.

Far back into the solid precipice ran that Cyclopean gouge, and deep down within earth\u2019s bowels its lower delvings yawned.

The day I made a pack for myself with food and water. I prepared for a land journey to find the vanished sea and rescue. On the morning I found the soil to walk. The smell of the fish was driving me. I was about matters to care about such a problem. I set out for an destination. All day I moved west. I was guided by a faraway hill that was than any rise on the rolling desert. That night I made camp. On the day I traveled toward the hill, though it seemed as when I saw it. By the evening I reached the base of the mound. It turned out to be than it looked from a distance. A valley between made it stand out from the land. to climb, I slept in the shadow of the hill. I do not know why my dreams were that night. Before the shrinking. shaped moon had risen above the plain, I was in a sweat. I decided to sleep. The visions I had experienced were for me to bear. In the light of the moon, I saw how I had been to travel by day. Without the glare of the drying sun, my journey would have used energy., I felt to make the climb that had stopped me at sunset. Picking up my pack, I started for the top of the ground. I have said the sameness of the rolling plain was a source of horror to me. I think my horror was when I reached the top of the mound. Looked down the side into a pit. Its depths were not. Lit by the moon, which had not risen. I felt myself on the edge of the world. I was looking over the rim into a chaos of night. Through my fear ran memories of Paradise Lost. Of Satan 's climb through the realms of darkness. As the moon climbed in the sky, I began to see the valley slopes were not as I had thought.\n###\nThat night I slept but little, and the next day I made for myself a pack containing food and water, preparatory to an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible rescue. On the third morning I found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease. The odour of the fish was maddening; but I was too much concerned with graver things to mind so slight an evil, and set out boldly for an unknown goal. All day I forged steadily westward, guided by a far-away hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert. That night I encamped, and on the following day still travelled toward the hummock, though that object seemed scarcely nearer than when I had first espied it. By the fourth evening I attained the base of the mound, which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance; an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface. Too weary to ascend, I slept in the shadow of the hill. I know not why my dreams were so wild that night; but ere the waning and fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern plain, I was awake in a cold perspiration, determined to sleep no more. Such visions as I had experienced were too much for me to endure again. And in the glow of the moon I saw how unwise I had been to travel by day. Without the glare of the parching sun, my journey would have cost me less energy; indeed, I now felt quite able to perform the ascent which had deterred me at sunset. Picking up my pack, I started for the crest of the eminence. I have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a source of vague horror to me; but I think my horror was greater when I gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable pit or canyon, whose black recesses the moon had not yet soared high enough to illumine. I felt myself on the edge of the world; peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night. Through my terror ran curious reminiscences of Paradise Lost, and of Satan\u2019s hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darkness. As the moon climbed higher in the sky, I began to see that the slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as I had imagined."}

We were not stopped by the Kingsport people's fear or the summer visitors' usual laziness. We made a very frightening decision. Despite a conservative education. Because of it, because boring lives create wishes for the unknown, we made a strong promise. We promised to climb that avoided north cliff. Visit the very aged grey cottage in the sky. Very our more reasonable minds argued it made sense. Tehy said the place must have people living there. These people must reach it from inland along the easier ridge next to the Miskatonic river's mouth. Probably they probably traded in Arkham. They knew how little Kingsport liked their home. Or maybe they could not climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. We wakled along the smaller cliffs to where the great cliff rose boldly up to meet the sky. We became very sure no human feet could go up. Down that steep south slope. East and north it rose thousands of feet straight up from the water. So only the west side, inland and toward Arkham, was left.\n###\nAt length, being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the Kingsporter\u2019s fear nor the summer boarder\u2019s usual indolence, Olney made a very terrible resolve. Despite a conservative training\u2014or because of it, for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the unknown\u2014he swore a great oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit the abnormally antique grey cottage in the sky. Very plausibly his saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people who reached it from inland along the easier ridge beside the Miskatonic\u2019s estuary. Probably they traded in Arkham, knowing how little Kingsport liked their habitation, or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the Kingsport side. Olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things, and became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on that beetling southern slope. East and north it rose thousands of feet vertically from the water, so only the western side, inland and toward Arkham, remained."}

Experienced sleepwalkers at the clock's one-eyed number screen was very steady. The home soon learned that the until then ignored device had gained extra uses to fit such settings as knew its secret lists. At last it controlled three wohle rows of glowing numbers. Forever held many of its odd pre-sets. He spent very little time now in aware rest. He seemed to stir and settle only to check and cahnge the dial. His face and behavior had reached a shocking level of upset. The sleeper twice looked at the guide book, but was each time quickly confused. He knew nothing, he said, of any mysterious beeps or pulses. He had no idea how the snooze use could have turned on. What it wanted. His goal was to get the sleep of all the night hours without disturbance. A goal with which machine stops had no right lnik. The sleeper noted his liking for the clock's old booklet on sun time. But the device's giving in was only for a moment. It felt an entry, and blocked its user in a clear way. Until the sleeper left disgusted, and turned to other ways of night control.\n###\nThe attendance of both the uninitiated and seasoned somnambulists at the clock\u2019s cyclopean digital interface was very regular, and the household soon learned that the hitherto neglected device had acquired additional functions to accommodate such configurations as knew its secret menus; at last commanding three entire rows of luminous numerals and permanently harbouring many of its aberrant presets. He spent but little time now in conscious repose, apparently stirring and settling only to verify and adjust the dial; and his countenance and demeanour had attained an appalling pitch of agitation. The sleeper twice consulted the manual, but was each time brusquely confounded. He knew nothing, he said, of any mysterious beeps or pulsations; and had no idea how the snooze function could have activated or what it desired. His purpose was to achieve undisturbed the somnolence of all the hours of the night; a purpose with which mechanical interruptions had no legitimate concern. The sleeper mentioned his admiration for the clock\u2019s ancient brochure on solar time and other arcana, but the device\u2019s relenting was only momentary. It sensed an intrusion, and rebuffed its operator in no uncertain way; till the sleeper withdrew disgusted, and turned to other methods of nocturnal regulation."}

They found over a had been lost in the day 's battles. The wounded were put on beds in the ship. Pickman spoke against the habit of killing and eating one 's wounded. The soldiers were given oars or places. Under the clouds of night, the ship sailed. Carter was not to be leaving that island of secrets.

Falling apart sphinxes of that city. That city lived and died before the years of mna. The ghouls made camp among the fallen stones of Sarkomand. They sent a messenger for night - gaunts to serve as riding animals. Pickman and the leaders were for the help Carter had given them. Carter began to feel his plans wree going. He would be to ask for help from these allies. This was not for leaving this part of dreamland. For his search for the gods on top of Kadath. They kept the sunset city from his dreams. he talked of these things to the leaders. He told what he knew of the land where Kadath stands. He told of the shantaks. The mountains carved into - headed images that guard it. He spoke of the shantaks ' fear of night - gaunts. He told how the hippo - headed birds fly screaming from the holes up on the peaks. Those peaks divide Inganok from Leng.\n###\nAttacked from both sides, the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea, till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them. The hostile galley, meanwhile, had disappeared; and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victors. So by night Pickman and Carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with care, finding that over a fourth had been lost in the day\u2019s battles. The wounded were placed on bunks in the galley, for Pickman always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating one\u2019s own wounded, and the able-bodied troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places as they might most usefully fill. Under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed, and Carter was not sorry to be departing from that island of unwholesome secrets, whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered restlessly in his fancy. Dawn found the ship in sight of Sarkomand\u2019s ruined quays of basalt, where a few night-gaunt sentries still waited, squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the years of man. The ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of Sarkomand, despatching a messenger for enough night-gaunts to serve them as steeds. Pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid Carter had lent them; and Carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well, and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of dreamland, but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown Kadath, and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from his slumbers. Accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders; telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein Kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into double-headed images which guard it. He spoke of the fear of shantaks for night-gaunts, and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide Inganok from hateful Leng."}

The good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed."}

Here I will describe only the main impressions in a shapeless, wandering way. Reality or otherwise, the smell told of the arrival of those astringent chemical agents. They came to the new, empty room from commercial containers. It todl of their arrival, and the arrival of many other foreign essences. Such essences at set times begin smell pioneering. They seemed able to fill the still air with their vast, invisible strands. This oddly confirmed some strange local rumors told to me long ago by a hygiene inspector. They had stayed in the ventilation shafts long time. They built ghostly structures and fought silent wars with microbial enemies. They used complex formulas employing unknown principles of sterility. Evidently their anitseptic and cleaning knowledge far exceeded common practice today. But they used its mroe widespread and detailed forms only when forced to. Some of the smells suggested they had gone through a stage of industrial strength in distant labs. But they had softened upon finding its effects too strong for the sesnes. Their unnatural lasting power of makeup. Simplicity of basic nature made them strangely able to control the setting. They did this without the more specialized tools of mechanical spreading. They did it even without extra help except for regular renewal against the advance of contaimnation.\n###\nThe full account, so far as apprehended, will presently be issued in an official circular of the municipal sanitation board. Here I shall delineate only the salient impressions in a formless, rambling way. Reality or otherwise, the odour spoke of the advent of those astringent chemical agents to the nascent, unpeopled chamber out of commercial containers\u2014their advent, and the advent of many other alien essences such as at appointed intervals embark upon olfactory pioneering. They seemed able to permeate the stagnant atmosphere with their vast, invisible tendrils\u2014thus oddly confirming some curious local rumours long ago related to me by a hygienic inspector. They had lingered in the ventilation shafts a great while, constructing phantom architectures and waging silent wars with microbial adversaries by means of intricate formulations employing unknown principles of sterility. Evidently their antiseptic and purifying knowledge far surpassed common practice today, though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate manifestations only when compelled to. Some of the emanations hinted that they had passed through a stage of industrialized potency in distant laboratories, but had mellowed upon finding its effects sensorially overwhelming. Their preternatural persistence of composition and simplicity of elemental nature made them peculiarly able to dominate the environment without the more specialised instruments of mechanical diffusion, and even without reinforcement except for periodic renewal against the encroachments of contamination."}

The penguins alone could not have saved them. But together with the mist, they seem to have done so. Only good luck kept the curling fog thick enough at the right time. It was always shifting and almost disappearing. It did lift for a second just before escape from the sickly re-carved tunnel into the cave. So one actually gets a first and only half-look at the coming thing. This happens as a last, very fearful look is cast back. Then the torch is dimmed. They mix with the penguins to try to avoid pursuit. If the luck that hid the escape was good, the luck that gave the half-look was very bad. That brief, partial sight is the source of half the horror that has been kept since.\n###\nThe fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on the right one. The penguins alone could not have saved us, but in conjunction with the mist they seem to have done so. Only a benign fate kept the curling vapours thick enough at the right moment, for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish. Indeed, they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the nauseously re-sculptured tunnel into the cave; so that we actually caught one first and only half-glimpse of the oncoming entity as we cast a final, desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the torch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit. If the fate which screened us was benign, that which gave us the half-glimpse was infinitely the opposite; for to that flash of semi-vision can be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us."}

However, we soon realized our discomfort had a second, possibly equally strong cause. It came from the pictures and mathematical ideas in the strange designs. The patterns all suggested distant secrets and huge depths in time and space. The repeated water theme in the carvings became almost threatening. Among these carvings were unbelievable monsters. They were veyr ugly and evil-looking, partly fish-like and partly frog-like. We could not separate them from a haunting, uncomfortable feeling of false memory. It was as if they brought up an image from deep, ancient parts of the mind that store very old, primal memories. Sometimes we imagined thta every line of thees wrong fish-frogs was full of the prue essence of unknown, non-human evil.\n###\nHowever, I soon saw that my uneasiness had a second and perhaps equally potent source residing in the pictorial and mathematical suggestions of the strange designs. The patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space, and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister. Among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignity\u2014half ichthyic and half batrachian in suggestion\u2014which one could not dissociate from a certain haunting and uncomfortable sense of pseudo-memory, as if they called up some image from deep cells and tissues whose retentive functions are wholly primal and awesomely ancestral. At times I fancied that every contour of these blasphemous fish-frogs was overflowing with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil."}

The Orne material was of the greatest immediate interest. We quickly proved from handwriting that Simon Orne and his supposed son were the same person. This was already suggested by the letter to Curwen. As Orne told his correspondent it was not safe to live too in Salem. So he spent thirty years abroad. He only returned to claim his lands as a member of a generation. Orne had destroyed most of his letters. But in 1771, citizens found and kept a few papers. These papers caused wonder. There were formulas and diagrams in his and other writing. We copied or photographed them. There was one very mysterious letter. Its handwriting matched items in the Registry of Deeds. It was positively Joseph Curwen's.\n###\nBut of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwen\u2019s."}

A pale glow gathered at the edge of the frantic screen. My irritation turned to hard acceptance. This left room for my fear of the low battery to return. I leaned a step toward the nightstand. The charger was balanced unsteadily on its edge. The cable was still held in my right hand. My left hand reached out for the port. The cable grew tight and finally clicked into its hidden socket. It let into the device a flood of that awful electric current. The deepening night had demanded it. In those blue glows, the room lights grew dim. A new appearance of fake life spread over the dust-smelling room. The room had warped baseboards, a sagging mattress, a beaten headboard, shaky furniture. It spread over the phone too. This was either from the same source or because of its hiddne and greedy hunger. I saw it swell and brighten as it lay still. It tried to drink the strange energies with a vampire's thirst.

It grew as the case around it wramed and hummed.\n###\nAt this point three slow and very deliberate beeps issued from the device, and a pale glow gathered at the edge of the frantic screen.

Around 3:30 p.m., a heavy weight fell, disturbing everyone in the house. Knocking over three of the wicker baskets. The room was dark, and the hlalway still shone with that pale afternoon light. As the family dealt with the baskets, my burden was noticed. Given my earlier work, this did not mkae anyone stop. Yet as many as three peopleseemed to feel something bad in the air. Grandmother told Cousin Althea taht this was a fear passed down from old family storiesand are only lifted near rooms where many dirty clothes are collected. Close to four, the weight increased as suddenly as it started, leaving the laundry piles in new.\n###\nAbout 3:30 p.m. a ponderous weight descended, unsettling everyone in the household and toppling three of the wicker hampers. The room was unlit, and the corridor still glowed with that pallid afternoon light. As the family saw to the hampers my burden was noted, but in view of my previous labors this circumstance gave no one pause. And yet as many as three persons\u2014all relatives\u2014seemed to sense something ominous in the atmosphere. Grandmother explained to Cousin Althea that this was a dread inherited from ancestral lore\u2014the elders having woven a curious fabric of baleful superstition about the heavy baskets which at regular intervals accumulate within the closets under a tidy house. Such burdens, it is whispered, swell from the great woven receptacles under the stairs where terrible washings have occurred\u2014and are never hefted except near chambers where the many soiled garments are gathered. Close to four the weight intensified as suddenly as it had begun, leaving the laundry piles in new and unfamiliar forms."}

I did not know what to say in answer, but scratched off some incoherent words of advice and encouragement and sent them by registered mail. I recall urging Akeley to move to Brattleboro at once, and place himself under the protection of the authorities; adding that I would come to that town with the phonograph record and help convince the courts of his sanity. It was time, too, I think I wrote, to alarm the people generally against this thing in their midst. It will be observed that at this moment of stress my own belief in all Akeley had told and claimed was virtually complete, though I did think his failure to get a picture of the dead monster was due not to any freak of Nature but to some excited slip of his own. Then, apparently crossing my incoherent note and reaching me Saturday afternoon, September 8th, came that curiously different and calming letter neatly typed on a new machine; that strange letter of reassurance and invitation which must have marked so prodigious a transition in the whole nightmare drama of the lonely hills. Again I will quote from memory\u2014seeking for special reasons to preserve as much of the flavour of the style as I can. It was postmarked Bellows Falls, and the signature as well as the body of the letter was typed\u2014as is frequent with beginners in typing."}

Unseen voices sang with joy as the group of knights fell over the edge. They drifted gently down past shining clouds and silver flashes. The horsemen floated down. Their horses moved their legs in the air as if running on golden sand. Then the glowing mists opened up. They showed a brighter light. This was the light of the [THING] Celepha\u00efs. They also showed the coast beyond. They showed the snowy [THING] top that looks over the [THING]. They showed the brightly painted ships that sail from the harbor. These ships go to far places where the [THING] touches the [THING]. And Kruanes ruled after that over Ooth - Nargai and all the nearby dream lands. He held his court sometimes in Celepha\u00efs and sometimes in the [THING] - made Serannian. He still rules there now. He will rule happily forever. Below the cliffs at Innsmouth, the [THING] tides played cruelly with the [THING] of a homeless [THING]. This [THING] had walked through the partly empty [THING] at sunrise. The tides played cruelly and threw the [THING] on the rocks near ivy - covered Trevor Towers. There, a very fat. Very unpleasant millionaire [THING] maker enjoys the bought feeling of old nobility. The change in my best friend Crawford Tillinghast was beyond undersatnding. I had not seen him since that day two and a half months before. On that day, he had told me what goal his physical. Mental studies were aiming for. He had answered my scared and almost frightened objections. He did this by chasing me from his lab. His [THING] in a sudden fit of crazy angre. I had known that he now stayed mostly closed in his attic lab with that cursed electrical [THING]. He ate little and kept even the servants out. I had not thought that a short time of ten weeks could. Ruin any human being. It is not nice to see a heavy [THING] suddenly become thin. It is even worse when the loose skin turns yellow or gray. The eyes sink in, have circles, and shine strangely. The forehead shows veins and wrinkles. The hands shake and jrek. If you add to this a disgusting messiness, a crazy disorder of clothes, thick dark hair with white roots. An uncontrolled growth of pure white beard on a once smooth [THING], the total effect is very shocking.\n###\nThe abyss was now a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour, and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations. Endlessly down the horsemen floated, their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness, the brightness of the city Celepha\u00efs, and the sea-coast beyond, and the snowy peak overlooking the sea, and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky. And Kuranes reigned thereafter over Ooth-Nargai and all the neighbouring regions of dream, and held his court alternately in Celepha\u00efs and in the cloud-fashioned Serannian. He reigns there still, and will reign happily forever, though below the cliffs at Innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had stumbled through the half-deserted village at dawn; played mockingly, and cast it upon the rocks by ivy-covered Trevor Towers, where a notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility. Horrible beyond conception was the change which had taken place in my best friend, Crawford Tillinghast. I had not seen him since that day, two months and a half before, when he had told me toward what goal his physical and metaphysical researches were leading; when he had answered my awed and almost frightened remonstrances by driving me from his laboratory and his house in a burst of fanatical rage. I had known that he now remained mostly shut in the attic laboratory with that accursed electrical machine, eating little and excluding even the servants, but I had not thought that a brief period of ten weeks could so alter and disfigure any human creature. It is not pleasant to see a stout man suddenly grown thin, and it is even worse when the baggy skin becomes yellowed or greyed, the eyes sunken, circled, and uncannily glowing, the forehead veined and corrugated, and the hands tremulous and twitching. And if added to this there be a repellent unkemptness; a wild disorder of dress, a bushiness of dark hair white at the roots, and an unchecked growth of pure white beard on a face once clean-shaven, the cumulative effect is quite shocking."}

They took anything from the butchers and grocers. They took gold. The men of Parg whom they bought by weight. The smells from those ships which the wind blew in from the docks can not be described. by smoking tahgweed could the person in the sea - taverns bear them. Dylath - Leen would have allowed the ships if rubies could be gotten. But no mine in all earth 's dreamland was known to produce their. Of these things, Dylath - Leen 's people gossiped. Carter waited for the ship from Baharna. This ship might carry him to the island where carved Ngranek towers stand., he did not fail to search through the places where travelers gather for any stories they might have about Kadath in the desert. Stories about a city of marble walls. Silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset. Of these things,, he learned nothing. Though he thought a slant - merchant looekd when the desert was spoken of. This man was said to trade with the stone villages on the icy desert plateau of Leng. No people visit. Their fires are seen at night from. He was rumored to have dealt with that - priest not to be described. This priest wears a silk mask over its face. Lives in a stone monastery. That such a person might have had dealings with beings that may live in the desert was not to be doubted. But Carter found it was no use questioning him. the ship slipped inot the harbor past the stone breakwater. The lighthouse. It was. Foreign, with a stench thta the wind drove into the town. Uneasiness moved through the taevrns along that waterfront. The - merchants with turbans. feet walked to seek the markets of the jewelers. Carter watched them. He disliked them the he looked at them. he saw them drive the men of Parg up the gangplank. The men grunted and sweated inot that ship. He wondered in what landsthose fat, creatures might be meant to serve.\n###\nThat was all they ever took, those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers; never anything from the butchers and grocers, but only gold and the fat black men of Parg whom they bought by the pound. And the odours from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described. Only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old sea-taverns bear them. Dylath-Leen would never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable elsewhere, but no mine in all earth\u2019s dreamland was known to produce their like. Of these things Dylath-Leen\u2019s cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst Carter waited patiently for the ship from Baharna, which might bear him to the isle whereon carven Ngranek towers lofty and barren. Meanwhile he did not fail to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they might have concerning Kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset. Of these things, however, he learned nothing; though he once thought that a certain old slant-eyed merchant looked queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of. This man was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of Leng, which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar. He was even rumoured to have dealt with that high-priest not to be described, which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery. That such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted, but Carter soon found that it was no use questioning him. Then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt mole and the tall lighthouse, silent and alien, and with a strange stench that the south wind drove into the town. Uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront, and after a while the dark wide-mouthed merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped stealthily ashore to seek the bazaars of the jewellers. Carter observed them closely, and disliked them more the longer he looked at them. Then he saw them drive the stout black men of Parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into that singular galley, and wondered in what lands\u2014or if in any lands at all\u2014those fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve."}

Fame of these earlier explorers that made our own trip seem small. Our trip was large, but the world hardly noticed it. As the newspapres said, we sailed from Boston on September 2, 1930. We went slowly down the coast and through the Panama Canal. We stopped at Valparaiso and Callao, Peru. At Callao, we got our last supplies. None of our exploring group had been to the polar araes before. So we all relied a lot on our ship captains. These were J. B. Douglas, in charge of the brig Arkham. Leader of the sea group. Georg Thorfinnssen, in charge of the barque Miskatonic. Both were experienced whalers in Antarctic waters. As we left the lived-in world behind, the sun sank lower in the north. It stayed longer above the horizon each day. At about 62\u00b0 South Latitude we saw our first icebergs. They were flat with straight sides. Just before reaching the Antarctic Circle, which we crossed on October 20 with fitting old-style ceremonies, we had much trouble with field ice. The dropping temperature bothered me a lot after our long trip through the tropics. But I tried to get ready for worse hardships to come. Many times, strange sky effects delighted me greatly. These included a very clear mirage, the first I had ever seen. In it, far-off icebergs became the walls of unbelievable space castles. Going through the ice, which was luckily not wide. Tightly packed, we reached open water at South Latitude 67\u00b0, West Longitude 175\u00b0. On the morning of October 26, a strong \"land blink\" showed in the south. Before noon, we all felt a thrill of excitement. We saw a huge, high, snow-covered mountain range. It opened up and filled the whole view ahead. At last we had met an outpost of the great unknown continent. Its secret world of frozen death. These peaks were clearly Admiralty Range found by Ross. Now our job was to go around Cape Adare. Sail down the east coast of Victoria Land. We would go to our planned base on the shore of McMurdo Sound at the bottom of the volcano Erebus at South Latitude 77\u00b0 9'. The last part of the trip was clear and exciting. Great empty mystery peaks kept appearing in the west. The low northern sun at noon. The even lower southern sun at mindight shone its misty red light over the white snow, blue ice. Black bits of visible granite slope.\n###\nIt was the unusual number and fame of these predecessors which made our own expedition\u2014ample though it was\u2014so little noticed by the world at large. As the newspapers told, we sailed from Boston Harbour on September 2, 1930; taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the Panama Canal, and stopping at Samoa and Hobart, Tasmania, at which latter place we took on final supplies. None of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before, hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains\u2014J. B. Douglas, commanding the brig Arkham, and serving as commander of the sea party, and Georg Thorfinnssen, commanding the barque Miskatonic\u2014both veteran whalers in antarctic waters. As we left the inhabited world behind the sun sank lower and lower in the north, and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day. At about 62\u00b0 South Latitude we sighted our first icebergs\u2014table-like objects with vertical sides\u2014and just before reaching the Antarctic Circle, which we crossed on October 20 with appropriately quaint ceremonies, we were considerably troubled with field ice. The falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the tropics, but I tried to brace up for the worse rigours to come. On many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly; these including a strikingly vivid mirage\u2014the first I had ever seen\u2014in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles. Pushing through the ice, which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed, we regained open water at South Latitude 67\u00b0, East Longitude 175\u00b0. On the morning of October 26 a strong \u201cland blink\u201d appeared on the south, and before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast, lofty, and snow-clad mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead. At last we had encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic world of frozen death. These peaks were obviously the Admiralty Range discovered by Ross, and it would now be our task to round Cape Adare and sail down the east coast of Victoria Land to our contemplated base on the shore of McMurdo Sound at the foot of the volcano Erebus in South Latitude 77\u00b0 9'. The last lap of the voyage was vivid and fancy-stirring, great barren peaks of mystery looming up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon or the still lower horizon-grazing southern sun of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow, bluish ice and water lanes, and black bits of exposed granite slope."}

All at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short, sharp gasp. The others looked at him, and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly arrested. There was no need for words. What had been disputed in country gossip was disputable no longer, and it is because of the thing which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on that the strange days are never talked about in Arkham. It is necessary to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening. One did arise not long afterward, but there was absolutely none then. Even the dry tips of the lingering hedge-mustard, grey and blighted, and the fringe on the roof of the standing democrat-wagon were unstirred. And yet amid that tense, godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving. They were twitching morbidly and spasmodically, clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked by some alien and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors writhing and struggling below the black roots. Not a man breathed for several seconds. Then a cloud of darker depth passed over the moon, and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily. At this there was a general cry; muffled with awe, but husky and almost identical from every throat. For the terror had not faded with the silhouette, and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that treetop height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance, tipping each bough like the fire of St. Elmo or the flames that came down on the apostles\u2019 heads at Pentecost. It was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light, like a glutted swarm of corpse-fed fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh; and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which Ammi had come to recognise and dread. All the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter, bringing to the minds of the huddled men a sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could form."}

Their feelings of tnese expectation as they got ready to go over the ridge. Look out on an untouched world are hard to put on paper. They had no reason to think the areas beyond the mountains were very different from those they had already seen. The hint of evil mystery in these barrier mountains. In the inviting sea of milky sky sene between their peaks, was a very subtle. It could not be explainde in plain words. Rather was it a matter of vague psychological symbolism. Aesthetic connection\u2014something mixed with exotic poetry. With ancient myths hidden in avoided. Even sound of the wind carried a peculiar sense of conscious evil. For a moment, it seemed the combined sound included a strange musical whistling. Piping over a wide range. This happened as the wind blew in. Out of the ever-prseent. Echoing cave openings. There was a vague tone of remembered disgust in this sound. It was as complex and hard to place as any of the other dark feelings.\n###\nOur sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper; even though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from those already seen and traversed.

Rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic association\u2014a thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings, and with archaic myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes. Even the wind\u2019s burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity; and for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cave-mouths. There was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound, as complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressions."}

I hope when this planet ends, they remain untouched. We were struggling up the huge spiral slope. Then we first felt the terrible tiredness and shortness of breath. Our run through the thin highland air had caused this. But not even the fear of falling down could make us stop. We would not stop before reaching normal outside world of [THING] and [THING]. There was something vaguely fitting about our leaving those buried ancient times. We wound our panting way up the sixty - foot tube of ancient stonework. We saw beside us a continuous line of heroic carvings. They were in the early and undecayed style of the dead race. It was a goodbye from the Old Ones, made fifty million years ago. Finally climbed out at the top. We found ourselves on a great pile of fallen [THING] blocks. Curved walls of higher [THING] rose to the west. The brooding peaks of the great mountains showed beynod the more broken structures to the east. The low Antarctic midnight [THING] looked red from the southern horizon. It shone through gaps in the rough ruins. The terrible age and deadness of the nightmare [THING] seemed even sharper by contrast. It contrasted with the relatively known. Familiar things like the features of the polar landscape. The [THING] above was a churning and milky mass of thin ice - vapors. The cold gripped our insides. Wearily set down the gear bags. We had held onto them through our desperate escape. We rebuttoned our heavy clothes for the stumbling climb down the pile. Then we walked through the ancient [THING] maze to the foothills. Our airplane waited there. We said nothing about what had made us run from the darkness of earth 's secret. In less than fifteen minutes we found the steep slope to the foothills. This was probably the ancient terrace we had come down. We could see the dark shape of our big plane among the few ruins on the rising slope ahead. Half walked uphill toward our goal. We stopped for a short rest to breathe. We turned to look again at the fantastic ancient tangle of unbelievable [THING] shapes below us. Once more they were outlined mystically against an unknown western [THING]. As we did this, we saw the [THING] beyond had lost its morning haziness. The restless ice - vapors had moved up to the top of the [THING]. Their mocking outlines seemed about to form some bizarre pattern. They seemed afraid to make this pattern very clear or final.\n###\nThey have a strange and titanic mausoleum, and I hope the end of this planet will find them still undisturbed. It was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible fatigue and short breath which our race through the thin plateau air had produced; but not even the fear of collapse could make us pause before reaching the normal outer realm of sun and sky. There was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those buried epochs; for as we wound our panting way up the sixty-foot cylinder of primal masonry we glimpsed beside us a continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the dead race\u2019s early and undecayed technique\u2014a farewell from the Old Ones, written fifty million years ago. Finally scrambling out at the top, we found ourselves on a great mound of tumbled blocks; with the curved walls of higher stonework rising westward, and the brooding peaks of the great mountains shewing beyond the more crumbled structures toward the east. The low antarctic sun of midnight peered redly from the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins, and the terrible age and deadness of the nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such relatively known and accustomed things as the features of the polar landscape. The sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous ice-vapours, and the cold clutched at our vitals. Wearily resting the outfit-bags to which we had instinctively clung throughout our desperate flight, we rebuttoned our heavy garments for the stumbling climb down the mound and the walk through the aeon-old stone maze to the foothills where our a\u00ebroplane waited. Of what had set us fleeing from the darkness of earth\u2019s secret and archaic gulfs we said nothing at all. In less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothills\u2014the probable ancient terrace\u2014by which we had descended, and could see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on the rising slope ahead. Half way uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing-spell, and turned to look again at the fantastic palaeogean tangle of incredible stone shapes below us\u2014once more outlined mystically against an unknown west. As we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness; the restless ice-vapours having moved up to the zenith, where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive."}

On On July 16, 1923, the chronicler moved into Exham Priory after the lsat workman finished. The restoration was a huge task. Little was left of the deserted building but a shell-like ruin. Because it was the seat of his ancestors, he let no cost stop him. The place had not been lived in since the reign of James the Fisrt. At that time, a very hideous tragedy struck down the master, five of his children. The nature of the tragedy was largely unexplained. It drove out the third son under suspicion and terror. He was the direct ancestor and only survivor of the hated line. This sole heir was called a murderer. The estate went back to the crown. The accused man did not try to clear his name or get his property back. Shaken by a horror greater than conscience. The law, he only wished frantically to keep the old building out of his sight.

The restoration had been a stupendous task, for little had remained of the deserted pile but a shell-like ruin; yet because it had been the seat of my ancestors I let no expense deter me. The place had not been inhabited since the reign of James the First, when a tragedy of intensely hideous, though largely unexplained, nature had struck down the master, five of his children, and several servants; and driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the third son, my lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred line. With this sole heir denounced as a murderer, the estate had reverted to the crown, nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate himself or regain his property.

We hoped to finish our work in one Antarctic summer. But if that was not possible, we would stay through the winter on the Arkham. We would send the Miskatonic north before the ice froze for another summer 's supplies. I do not need to say again what the newspapers already printed about our early work. This includes our climb of Mt. Erebu.s Our successful mineral drillings at several points on Ross Island. The amazing speed of Pabodie 's equipment, even through solid [THING]. Our test of the small ice - melting gear. Our dangerous climb of the great barrier with sleds and supplies. Our final putting together of five large airplanes at the camp on top of the barrier. Our land group 's health was very good. There were twenty men and 55 Alaskan sledge dogs. Of course, we had not met any truly damaging cold or windstorms yet. Mostly, the thermometer read between zero and 20 \u00b0 or 25 \u00b0 above. Our time with New England winters had gotten us used to cold like this. The barrier camp was half - permanent. It was meant to be a storage place for gasoline, [THING], dynamite, and other supplies. Only four of our planes were needed to carry the real exploring material. The fifth was left with a pilot and two ship men at the storage camp. This was to have a way to reach us from the Arkham if all our exploring planes were lost. Later, when not using all other planes to move equipment, we would use one. Two for a shuttle service. This would be between this storage camp and another permanent base on the great plateau. This base was 600 to 700 miles south, beyond the mountains. Despite the nearly agreed stories of awful winds. Storms that come down from the plateau, we chose not to have middle bases. We would take our chances to save time and likely work better. Wireless reports have talked about our group 's amazing four - hour non - stop flight on November 21 over the high shelf ice.

When the huge rise appeared ahead, between South Latitude 83 \u00b0. 84 \u00b0, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier. This is the biggest valley glacier in the world. The frozen [THING] was now changing to a steep and mountainous coast.\n###\nThe ship\u2019s outfit, communicating with the outside world, was to convey press reports to the Arkham Advertiser\u2019s powerful wireless station on Kingsport Head, Mass. We hoped to complete our work during a single antarctic summer; but if this proved impossible we would winter on the Arkham, sending the Miskatonic north before the freezing of the ice for another summer\u2019s supplies. I need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work: of our ascent of Mt. Erebus; our successful mineral borings at several points on Ross Island and the singular speed with which Pabodie\u2019s apparatus accomplished them, even through solid rock layers; our provisional test of the small ice-melting equipment; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies; and our final assembling of five huge a\u00ebroplanes at the camp atop the barrier. The health of our land party\u2014twenty men and 55 Alaskan sledge dogs\u2014was remarkable, though of course we had so far encountered no really destructive temperatures or windstorms. For the most part, the thermometer varied between zero and 20\u00b0 or 25\u00b0 above, and our experience with New England winters had accustomed us to rigours of this sort. The barrier camp was semi-permanent, and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline, provisions, dynamite, and other supplies. Only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material, the fifth being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the Arkham in case all our exploring planes were lost. Later, when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus, we would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from 600 to 700 miles southward, beyond Beardmore Glacier. Despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the plateau, we determined to dispense with intermediate bases; taking our chances in the interest of economy and probable efficiency. Wireless reports have spoken of the breath-taking four-hour non-stop flight of our squadron on November 21 over the lofty shelf ice, with vast peaks rising on the west, and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines. Wind troubled us only moderately, and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we encountered. When the vast rise loomed ahead, between Latitudes 83\u00b0 and 84\u00b0, we knew we had reached Beardmore Glacier, the largest valley glacier in the world, and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coastline."}

He looked with interest at the streets. Wooden ox - carts moved. merchants shouted about their goods in the markets. The sea taverns were near the docks on stone streets. The streets were from tide spray. The taverns looked. They had ceilings with beams. Their windows had glass with centers. sailors in those taverns talked a lot about ports. They told stories about the men from the Inganok. But they added to what the ship 's sailors had said., after loading and unloading, the ship sailed on the sunset sea. The walls and roofs of Hlanith grew. The daylight gave them a wonder. Beauty than any people gave them. The ship sailed for two nights and two days over Cerenerian Sea. It saw no land and met one ship. Naer sunset on the day, the top of Aran appeared. Ginkgo trees swayed on its slopes. Carter knew they had reached the land of Ooth - Nargai and the city of Celepha\u00efs. the shining towers of that town came into view. They saw the marble walls with their bronze statues. They saw the stone bridge where Naraxa meets the sea. the, hills behind the town rose up. They had groves and gardens of asphodel flowers. They had shrines and cottages on them. in the distance was the line of the Tanarians. It looked and. Behind it were forbidden paths to the waking world and to dream regions. The harbor was of painted ships. Some came from the marble cluod - city of Serannian. That city lise in the air where the sea meets the sky. Some came from ports on the dreamland oceans. Among these, the pilot steered his way to the spice - smelling docks. The ship tied up at dusk. The city 's million lights began to twinkle over the water. This city of dreams seemed., time can not damage or destroy anything.\n###\nThe wharves of Hlanith are of oak, and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns. Carter also went ashore, and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox-carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars. The sea-taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salt with the spray of high tides, and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and casements of greenish bull\u2019s-eye panes. Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports, and told many stories of the curious men from twilight Inganok, but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told. Then, at last, after much unloading and loading, the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea, and the high walls and gables of Hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them. Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea, sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel. Then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of Aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the lower slopes, and Carter knew that they were come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and the marvellous city of Celepha\u00efs. Swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town, and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues, and the great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea. Then rose the green gentle hills behind the town, with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them; and far in the background the purple ridge of the Tanarians, potent and mystical, behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream. The harbour was full of painted galleys, some of which were from the marble cloud-city of Serannian, that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky, and some of which were from more substantial ports on the oceans of dreamland. Among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spice-fragrant wharves, where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the city\u2019s million lights began to twinkle out over the water. Ever new seemed this deathless city of vision, for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy."}

Then on the fifteenth of April, a strange thing happened. Nothing seemed to change in type, but there was a very poor change in amount. Dr. Willett thinks this change is very important. The day was Good Friday. The servants thought this was important, but others see it as just a coincidence. In the afternoon, young Ward began to say a certain set of words very loudly. At the same time, he burned something with a very strong smell. The smell spread through the whole house. The words were clearly heard outside the locked door. Mrs. Ward could not help but remember the words as she waited and listened worriedly. Later, she wrote them down when Dr. Willett asked. The words are below. Experts told Dr. Willett that very similar words are in the mystical writings of \"Eliphas Levi\". He was a mysterious person who saw frightening views of the empty space beyond a forbidden door.\n###\nThen on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willett\u2019s request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \u201cEliphas Levi\u201d, that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:"}

In April, the country people acetd strangely. They stopped using the road past Nahum's house. This led to the road being left later. The plants were the reason. All the fruit trees bloomed in colors. In the yard's rocky soil and the nearby field, plants grew. Only a plant expert could likn them to normal local plants. No normal, healthy colros were seen except in the green grass and leaves. Everywhere else, there were wild, rainbow-like colors. These colors came from a sickly base color not found in nature. The Dutchman's breeches plant seemed threatening. The bloodroot plants showed bold, wrong colors. Ammi and the Gardners thought most colors seemed strangely familiar. They decided the colors remindde them of the fragile ball inside the meteor. Nahum plowed and planted the ten-acre field and the hill land. He did nothing with the land near the house. He knew it would not help. He hoped the summer's plants would pull all the poison from the soil. He was ready for almost anything now. He had become used to feeling something near him, waiting to be heard. The neighbors avoiding his house affected him. It affected his wife more. The boys were better off because they went to school each day. But they could not avoid being scarde by the talk. Thaddeus, a very sensitive boy, suffered the most.\n###\nApril brought a kind of madness to the country folk, and began that disuse of the road past Nahum\u2019s which led to its ultimate abandonment. It was the vegetation. All the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth. The Dutchman\u2019s breeches became a thing of sinister menace, and the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion. Ammi and the Gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity, and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor. Nahum ploughed and sowed the ten-acre pasture and the upland lot, but did nothing with the land around the house. He knew it would be of no use, and hoped that the summer\u2019s strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil. He was prepared for almost anything now, and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to be heard. The shunning of his house by neighbours told on him, of course; but it told on his wife more. The boys were better off, being at school each day; but they could not help being frightened by the gossip. Thaddeus, an especially sensitive youth, suffered the most."}

As it got deeper, the bad smell grew stronger. He no longer doubted he was about to touhc the evil thing. Its presence had cursed the house for over 150 years. He wondered what it would look like. He wondered about its shape and material. He wondered how large it might have grown over a long time of sucking life. Finally, he climbed out of the hole. He spread out the piled-up dirt. Then he placed the large acid containers around and near two sides of the hole. This was so he could empty them all quickly into opening when needed. After that, he only put earth along the other two sides. He worked more slowly. He put on his gas mask as the smell got worse. He was almost too scared to continue. He was very close to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit.\n###\nMy hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing in the large hole I had made.

I wondered what it would look like\u2014what its form and substance would be, and how big it might have waxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the hole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging the great carboys of acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might empty them all down the aperture in quick succession.

I met one farmer who thought he had seen one of the bodies during flood time in the West River. But his story was up to be. When I left Brattleboro, I decided to return to Vermont. I feel I will keep my decision. Those hills are the point of a space race. I doubt this since reading that a planet has been seen beyond Neptune, as those forces had said it would be seen. Astronomers, with a fittingness they guess, have named this thing \" Pltuo \". I feel, without question, that it is nothing than Yuggoth. I shake when I try to understand the reason why its residents want it to be known this way at this time. I try to tell myself these demon - creatures are not moving toward some plan to the earth. Its people. I have to tell about the end of that night in the farmhouse. As I said, I did fall into a sleep. This sleep was filled with pieces of dream that incldued views of land. I can not say what woke me. But I feel that I did wake at this point. My feeling was of creaking floorboards in the hall outside my door. There was a, muffled trying at the door latch. This,, stopped at. my feelings began with the voices heard from the study. There seemed to be speakers. I thought they were arguing. After I listened a seconds I was. The nature of the voices made all thought of sleep. The tones were. No one who had listened to that cursed phonograph record could have any doubts about the nature of two of them. though the idea was, I knew I was under the roof with namleess things from space. Those two voices were the buzzings which the Outside Beings used to talk with men. The two were. They were in pitch,, and speed. But they were both of the kind.\n###\nI even came upon one farmer who thought he had personally glimpsed one of the queer bodies at flood-time in the swollen West River, but his tale was too confused to be really valuable. When I left Brattleboro I resolved never to go back to Vermont, and I feel quite certain I shall keep my resolution. Those wild hills are surely the outpost of a frightful cosmic race\u2014as I doubt all the less since reading that a new ninth planet has been glimpsed beyond Neptune, just as those influences had said it would be glimpsed. Astronomers, with a hideous appropriateness they little suspect, have named this thing \u201cPluto\u201d. I feel, beyond question, that it is nothing less than nighted Yuggoth\u2014and I shiver when I try to figure out the real reason why its monstrous denizens wish it to be known in this way at this especial time. I vainly try to assure myself that these daemoniac creatures are not gradually leading up to some new policy hurtful to the earth and its normal inhabitants. But I have still to tell of the ending of that terrible night in the farmhouse. As I have said, I did finally drop into a troubled doze; a doze filled with bits of dream which involved monstrous landscape-glimpses. Just what awaked me I cannot yet say, but that I did indeed awake at this given point I feel very certain. My first confused impression was of stealthily creaking floor-boards in the hall outside my door, and of a clumsy, muffled fumbling at the latch. This, however, ceased almost at once; so that my really clear impressions began with the voices heard from the study below. There seemed to be several speakers, and I judged that they were controversially engaged. By the time I had listened a few seconds I was broad awake, for the nature of the voices was such as to make all thought of sleep ridiculous. The tones were curiously varied, and no one who had listened to that accursed phonograph record could harbour any doubts about the nature of at least two of them. Hideous though the idea was, I knew that I was under the same roof with nameless things from abysmal space; for those two voices were unmistakably the blasphemous buzzings which the Outside Beings used in their communication with men. The two were individually different\u2014different in pitch, accent, and tempo\u2014but they were both of the same damnable general kind."}

A feeling in the air made me not want to speak. The town looked in the afternoon sun. We went up a hill and turned onto street. It was like the New England cities you remember from being a boy. The way the roofs, steeples, chimneys. Brick walls were placed touched feelings from. I could tell I was at the entrance to a place under a spell. This was from the, build - up of time. It was a place where, things could grow. Stay because they were disturbed. As we left Brattleboro, my feeling of worry and dread grew. The hills. The, threatening green. Granite slopes suggested secrets. things that might. Might not be to people. For a while, our path followed a, river coming from hills. I shivered when my companion said it was the West River. I remembered from newspapers that one of the, crab - creatures was seen floating in this stream aftre the floods. the land around us became wilder and. Archaic covered bridges from the past stayed in pockets of the hills. The - abandoned train track to the river seemed to breathe out a, air of emptiness. There were views of valleys with cliffs. New England 's granite showed through the plants covering the tops. There were gorges where streams jumped down toward the river. They carried the secrets of a thousadn trackless peaks. Branching and were, - hidden roads. They cut through, masses of forest. armies of nature spirits could hide among those trees. Seeing these, I thought of how Akeley had been bothered by forces when he drove on this road. I did not wonder things could happen. The, village of Newfnae was than an hour. It was our connection to the world man can call his by right of winning. living in it.\n###\nI was glad that he did not overflow with conversation, for some peculiar atmospheric tensity made me feel disinclined to talk. The town seemed very attractive in the afternoon sunlight as we swept up an incline and turned to the right into the main street. It drowsed like the older New England cities which one remembers from boyhood, and something in the collocation of roofs and steeples and chimneys and brick walls formed contours touching deep viol-strings of ancestral emotion. I could tell that I was at the gateway of a region half-bewitched through the piling-up of unbroken time-accumulations; a region where old, strange things have had a chance to grow and linger because they have never been stirred up. As we passed out of Brattleboro my sense of constraint and foreboding increased, for a vague quality in the hill-crowded countryside with its towering, threatening, close-pressing green and granite slopes hinted at obscure secrets and immemorial survivals which might or might not be hostile to mankind. For a time our course followed a broad, shallow river which flowed down from unknown hills in the north, and I shivered when my companion told me it was the West River. It was in this stream, I recalled from newspaper items, that one of the morbid crab-like beings had been seen floating after the floods. Gradually the country around us grew wilder and more deserted. Archaic covered bridges lingered fearsomely out of the past in pockets of the hills, and the half-abandoned railway track paralleling the river seemed to exhale a nebulously visible air of desolation. There were awesome sweeps of vivid valley where great cliffs rose, New England\u2019s virgin granite shewing grey and austere through the verdure that scaled the crests. There were gorges where untamed streams leaped, bearing down toward the river the unimagined secrets of a thousand pathless peaks. Branching away now and then were narrow, half-concealed roads that bored their way through solid, luxuriant masses of forest among whose primal trees whole armies of elemental spirits might well lurk. As I saw these I thought of how Akeley had been molested by unseen agencies on his drives along this very route, and did not wonder that such things could be. The quaint, sightly village of Newfane, reached in less than an hour, was our last link with that world which man can definitely call his own by virtue of conquest and complete occupancy."}

The river flowed down from the unknown and terrible mountains to the west. It once turned at the foto of the Old Ones' mountain range. Then it folwed next to that range into Indian Ocean between Budd. Tottne Lands on Wilkes's coast. Over time, it is seen to have worn away the limestone base of the hill at its turn. Finally, its flowing water reached the underground water caves. It joined with them to dig a deeper hole. Its entire flow is known to have emptied into the hollow hills. This left the old riverbed toward the ocean dry. Part of later city, as is now found, was built over that old riverbed. The The Old Ones, who understood what happened, used their strong artistic sense. They carved the headlands of the foothills into fancy pylons. This was where the great stream started to go down itno permanent darkness.\n###\nThis vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains, and which had formerly turned at the base of the Old Ones\u2019 range and flowed beside that chain into the Indian Ocean between Budd and Totten Lands on Wilkes\u2019s coast-line. Little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning, till at last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in digging a deeper abyss. Finally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry. Much of the later city as we now found it had been built over that former bed. The Old Ones, understanding what had happened, and exercising their always keen artistic sense, had carved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the great stream began its descent into eternal darkness."}

In their later days, some of the Old Ones said odd prayers to those mountains. But no one ever went near them or tried to imagine what was past them. No person has ever seen them. As one looks at the feelings shown in the carvings, it is hoped no one ever will. There are protective hills along the coast beyond them. These are the Queen Mary and Kaiser Wilhelm Lands. It is a relief that no one has managed to land and climb those hills. One becomes less doubtful about old stories and fears than one might have been before. It is not possible to laugh now at the ancient sculptor's idea. That idea was that lightning sometimes stopped meaningfully at each dark peak. Also, an unexplained light shone from one of those terrible high points all during the long polar night. The old Pnakotic whispers about Kadath in the Cold Waste might have a very real. Very horrible meaning.\n###\nSome of the Old Ones, in the decadent days, had made strange prayers to those mountains; but none ever went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond.

Strangely, I had almost no doubt I could find a clear path up. Down the slope to all the levels still there. This huge, earth-protected building held the records of the whole solar system. It was built with amazing skill. Strength to last as long as the system itself. Blocks of huge size were placed with mathematical genius. They were joined with incredibly strong cement. Together they formed a mass as solid as the rocky center of the planet. Here, after amounts of time greater than I could sanely understand, its buried shape stood with all its main outlines. The huge, dust-covered floors were barely sprinkled with the scattered mess that was. The fairly easy walking from this point on strangely affected my mind. All the frantic eagerness that had been blocked by obstacles before now came out as a kind of feverish speed. I literally ran along the low-roofed, terribly familiar walkways beyond the archway. I was no longer surprised by how familiar everything I saw was. On every side, the great metal shelf doors with picture writing towered hugely. Some weer still closed. Ohters had sprung open. Still others were bent and crushed by past earth movements. Those movements were not quite strong enough to break the giant stonework. There, a dust-covered pile below an empty, open shelf seemed to show where boxes had been shaken down by earthquakes. On some pillars were large symbols or letters announcing groups and sub-groups of books. Once I stopped before an open storage room. I saw some of the usual metal boxes still in place among the ever-present gritty dust. Reaching up, I moved one of the thinner boxes with some trouble. I put it on the floor to look at it. Its title was in the common curved picture writing. But something about the arrangement of the characters seemed a little odd. The strange mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly known to me. I snapped open the still rust-free and working lid. I pulled out book inside. The book, as I expected, was about twenty by fifteen inches in size. Two inches thick. The thin metal covers opened at the top. Its tough cellulose pages seemed untouched by the countless cycles of time they had lived through. I studied the strangely colored, brush-drawn letters of the text. The symbols were completely unlike the usual curved picture writing. Any alphabet known to human learning. I felt a haunting, half-awakened memory.\n###\nThat I could find a clear passage up and down the incline to all the surviving levels, I had oddly little doubt. This vast, earth-protected pile, housing the annals of all the solar system, had been built with supernal skill and strength to last as long as that system itself. Blocks of stupendous size, poised with mathematical genius and bound with cements of incredible toughness, had combined to form a mass as firm as the planet\u2019s rocky core. Here, after ages more prodigious than I could sanely grasp, its buried bulk stood in all its essential contours; the vast, dust-drifted floors scarce sprinkled with the litter elsewhere so dominant. The relatively easy walking from this point onward went curiously to my head. All the frantic eagerness hitherto frustrated by obstacles now took itself out in a kind of febrile speed, and I literally raced along the low-roofed, monstrously well-remembered aisles beyond the archway. I was past being astonished by the familiarity of what I saw. On every hand the great hieroglyphed metal shelf-doors loomed monstrously; some yet in place, others sprung open, and still others bent and buckled under bygone geological stresses not quite strong enough to shatter the titan masonry. Here and there a dust-covered heap below a gaping empty shelf seemed to indicate where cases had been shaken down by earth-tremors. On occasional pillars were great symbols or letters proclaiming classes and sub-classes of volumes. Once I paused before an open vault where I saw some of the accustomed metal cases still in position amidst the omnipresent gritty dust. Reaching up, I dislodged one of the thinner specimens with some difficulty, and rested it on the floor for inspection. It was titled in the prevailing curvilinear hieroglyphs, though something in the arrangement of the characters seemed subtly unusual. The odd mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly well known to me, and I snapped up the still rustless and workable lid and drew out the book within. The latter, as expected, was some twenty by fifteen inches in area, and two inches thick; the thin metal covers opening at the top. Its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they had lived through, and I studied the queerly pigmented, brush-drawn letters of the text\u2014symbols utterly unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet known to human scholarship\u2014with a haunting, half-aroused memory."}

You did not need a special love of beatuy to be amazed by the otherworldly beauty of the rich, alien fantasy object on a purple velvet cushion. Even now, it is to describe what was seen. It was clearly a kind of tiara, as described. It was in front and had a very oddly uneven edge. It seemed made for a head with a strangely oval shape. The material looked mostly like gold. But a lighter shine suggested a mix with another hard-to-name metal. Its condition was nearly perfect. You could spend hours looking at the striking and puzzling designs. They were not traditional. Some were simple shapes, and some were clearly sea-related. They were carved. Shaped in relief on the surface with amazing skill.\n###\nIt took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange, unearthly splendour of the alien, opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion. Even now I can hardly describe what I saw, though it was clearly enough a sort of tiara, as the description had said. It was tall in front, and with a very large and curiously irregular periphery, as if designed for a head of almost freakishly elliptical outline. The material seemed to be predominantly gold, though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal.

I entered an area of complete emptiness that made me shhiver. Groups of gambrel roofs formed a uneven and strange skyilne. Above them rose the frightening, damaged steeple of an oold church. Some houses along Main Street were occupied. But most were closed up with boards. On the unpaved side streets, I saw the black, empty windows of abandoned huts. Many of these leaned at dangerous and unbelievable angles. This WAS due to parts of their foundations sinking. Those windows stared so ghostly that I neeeded courage to turn east toward the waterfront.. Indeed, the fear of a deserted house grows much faster as houses multiply to form a city of pure emptiness. The sight of such endless streets of vacatn, dead-eyed buildings starts deep fears. The thought of endless connected black rooms left to spiderss, memories. Decay starts old fears. The strongest philosophy cannot remove these feelings.\n###\nRe-crossing the gorge on the Main Street bridge, I struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder. Collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline, above which rose the ghoulish, decapitated steeple of an ancient church. Some houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse."}

The next thing I knew, I had stopped my wild calculations. I was sitting still, staring at a colmun of frustratingly familiar number entries. They were in almost perfect order. Only three of the numbers in this area had gone wrong. My feelings about thees columns cannot be described. The sense of knowledge was so complete and persistent. I was looking far down, at a total near the bottom. It was completely beyond my immediate understanding. I wondered how I could adjust it for the best result. An open difference four lines from the top would help. The decimals of the lined-up entries formed possible anchors for my eyes and pen. I would hold the pen between my teeth as I had in other ledgers where both hands were needed. Above all, I must make no mistake.

He took with him a gallon can of oil. He planned to keep this for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might find beyond the space with its altar. Nameless covered wells. To cross that space would require all his courage. He knew it must be done., neither the altar nor the opened shaft was near the wall with cell - indentations that bordered the cave area. The archways in that wall would form the goals of a search. He went to that pillared hall of stench and pained howling. He turned down his lamp to avoid any sight of the altar. Of the pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. of the doorways led to rooms. Some were and some were used as storerooms. In of the storerooms, he saw some collections of objects. One was packed with rotting and dust - covered bundles of clothing. The explorer felt a thrill when he saw it was clothing from a century. A half. In another room, he found bits and pieces of clothing. It was as if preparations were being made to equip a group of men. But what he disliked of all were the copper vats which appeared. These, and the crust on them. He liked them than the decorated lead bowls. The rims of these bowls held deposits. Around them clung disgusting smells above the foulness of crypt. When he had gone about half the circuit of the wall, he found another hallway like the one he had come from. doors opened off it. This he proceeded to check. After entering three - rooms with nothing in them, he came at to a room. Its tanks. instruments, books. shelves of jars. Bottles showed it was the - sought laboratory of Charles Ward. And no doubt of Joseph Curwen before him. After lighting the three lamps he found filled and, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its equipment with the interest. He noted from the amounts of chemicals on the shelves that Ward 's interest must have been in soem area of chemistry.\n###\nFailing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search. So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward\u2014and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him. After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Ward\u2019s dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry."}

The evening stars. Because my ancestors had called me to town beyond, I went on through the, fallen snow along the road that climbed up to where Aldebaran shone among the trees. On toward the town I had seen but dreamed of. It was the Yuletide, that men call Christmas though they know it is than Bethlehem. Babylo,n than Memphis. It was the Yuletide. I had come to the town where my people had lived. Held celebrations in the times when celebration was forbidden. Where they had told their sons to hold a celebration every hundred years. The memory of secrets might not be lost. Mine were an people. Were when this land was settled three hundred years. They were, because they had come as, people from gardens of orchids. Spoke another language before they learned the language of the - fishermen. they were spread out. Shared the rituals of mysteries that no one could understand. I was the one who came that night to the fishing town as the story said to do, for the. The remember. past the hill 's top I saw Kingsport spread out in the dusk. Snoyw Kingsport with its weather vanes. Steeples, roof beams. Chimney pots, docks. bridges, willow trees. mazes of,, streets. A church - topped hill that time dared not touch. puzzles of houses piled. Scattered at all angles. Heights like a child 's blocks. times hanging on wings over winter - roof peaks and - sloped roofs. - paned windows one by one shining out in the evening to join Orion. The stars. And against the rotting docks the sea hit. The, sea from which the people had come in the time. Beside the road at its top a hill rose,. I saw that it was a cemetery where gravestones stuck through the snow like the fingernails of a body.\n###\nIn the twilight I heard it pounding on the rocks, and I knew it lay just over the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing sky and the first stars of evening. And because my fathers had called me to the old town beyond, I pushed on through the shallow, new-fallen snow along the road that soared lonely up to where Aldebaran twinkled among the trees; on toward the very ancient town I had never seen but often dreamed of. It was the Yuletide, that men call Christmas though they know in their hearts it is older than Bethlehem and Babylon, older than Memphis and mankind. It was the Yuletide, and I had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden; where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century, that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten. Mine were an old people, and were old even when this land was settled three hundred years before. And they were strange, because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids, and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of the blue-eyed fishers. And now they were scattered, and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living could understand. I was the only one who came back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade, for only the poor and the lonely remember. Then beyond the hill\u2019s crest I saw Kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming; snowy Kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples, ridgepoles and chimney-pots, wharves and small bridges, willow-trees and graveyards; endless labyrinths of steep, narrow, crooked streets, and dizzy church-crowned central peak that time durst not touch; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a child\u2019s disordered blocks; antiquity hovering on grey wings over winter-whitened gables and gambrel roofs; fanlights and small-paned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join Orion and the archaic stars. And against the rotting wharves the sea pounded; the secretive, immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder time. Beside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose, bleak and windswept, and I saw that it was a burying-ground where black gravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a gigantic corpse."}

His mother listened in a worried way at night. This revealed that he often went out secrtely in the dark. Most expert doctors now agree he is responsible for the awful vampire cases. The press reported these cases in a sensational way at that time. The cases have not been clearly linked to any known person. These cases are too recent and famous to need detailed description. The victims were of all ages and types. The cases seemed to gather around two separate areas. One area was the residential hill and the North End, near the Ward home. The other area was the suburban districts across the Cranston line near Pawtuxet. Both late travelers and sleepers with open windows were attacked. Those who survived told the same story. They spoke of a thin, agile, jumping monster with burning eyes. It would bite the throat or upper arm and feed hungrily. Dr. Willett refuses to say Charles Ward's madness began this early. He is careful when trying to explain these horrors. He says he has his own theories. He limits his clear statements to a special kind of denial. He says, \"I will not say who. What I think did these attacks. But I will say that Charles Ward was not guilty of tehm. I have reason to be sure he did not know the taste of blood. His ongoing weak condition and growign paleness prove this better than words. Ward dealt with terrible things. But he has paid for it. He was never a monster or a bad person. As for now\u2014I don't like to think. A change happened. I am happy to believe the old Charles Ward died with it. His solu did, anyway. That mad body that disappeared from Waite's hospital had a different soul.\" Willett speaks with authority. He was often at the Ward home taking care of Mrs. Ward's nerves had started to break under the pressure. Her nighttime listening caused some sick fears. She told the doctor these fears hesitantly. He made fun of them when talking to her. But they made him think deeply when he was alone. These false ideas were always about the soft sounds she thought she heard. The sounds came from the attic laboratory and bedroom. They included muffled sighs and sobbings at very strange times. Early in July Willett ordered Mr.s Ward to go to Atlantic City for an open-ended rest stay. He warned both Mr. Ward and the tired, hard-to-find Charles to write her only happy letters.\n###\nThe morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time, but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need detailed mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two distinct localities; the residential hill and the North End, near the Ward home, and the suburban districts across the Cranston line near Pawtuxet. Both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked, and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean, lithe, leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously. Dr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far back as even this, is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors. He has, he declares, certain theories of his own; and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation. \u201cI will not,\u201d he says, \u201cstate who or what I believe perpetrated these attacks and murders, but I will declare that Charles Ward was innocent of them. I have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood, as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument. Ward meddled with terrible things, but he has paid for it, and he was never a monster or a villain. As for now\u2014I don\u2019t like to think. A change came, and I\u2019m content to believe that the old Charles Ward died with it. His soul did, anyhow, for that mad flesh that vanished from Waite\u2019s hospital had another.\u201d Willett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home attending Mrs. Ward, whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain. Her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in talking to her, although they made him ponder deeply when alone. These delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom, and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times. Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite recuperative sojourn, and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and elusive Charles to write her only cheering letters."}

Fifteen night - gaunts, Carter said, would be to keep any group of shantaks. it might be to have some ghouls in the group to handle the creatures. Their ways are known to their allies than to men. The group could land him at some point within whatever walls that onyx fortress might have. They would wait in the shadows for his return or his signal., he would go inside the castle to pray to the gods of earth. If any ghouls chose to go with him into the throne - room of the Great Ones, he would be. Their presence would add weight and importance to his request. He would not,, insist on this. He wished for travel to and from the castle on top of Kadath. The trip would be either to the sunset city itself, if the gods agreed. to the Gate of Deeper Slumber in the wood, if his prayers did not work. Whilst Carter was speaking. All the ghouls listened. As time passed, the sky became with clouds of those night - gaunts for which messengers had been sent. The winged horrors settled in a - circle around the army. They waited as the dog - leaders thought about the traveler 's wish. The ghoul that was Pickman talked with its friends. In the end, Carter was offered than he had at expected. As he had helped the ghouls in their win over the moon - beasts. They would help him in his trip to places from where none had returned. They would lend him not a of their night - gaunts. Their army as they camped. This included fighting ghouls and gathered night - gaunts. They would keep a guard for the captured shi.p things taken from the rock in the sea. They would leave through the air whenever he wished. arrived on Kadath, a group of ghouls would go with him in style as he presented his request to earth 's gods in their onyx castle. Moved by a thankfulness. Happiness beyond words, Carter made plans with the leaders for his trip. The army would fly, they decided, over Leng with its nameless monastery. stone villages. They wuold stop at the peaks to talk with the shantak - night - gaunts. Their holes covered the tops of those peaks.\n###\nA flock of ten or fifteen night-gaunts, Carter glibbered, would surely be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance; though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures, their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men. The party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have, waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth. If any ghouls chose to escort him into the throne-room of the Great Ones, he would be thankful, for their presence would add weight and importance to his plea. He would not, however, insist upon this but merely wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown Kadath; the final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself, in case the gods proved favourable, or back to the earthward Gate of Deeper Slumber in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitless. Whilst Carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention, and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those night-gaunts for which messengers had been sent. The winged horrors settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army, waiting respectfully as the dog-like chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller. The ghoul that was Pickman glibbered gravely with its fellows, and in the end Carter was offered far more than he had at most expected. As he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the moon-beasts, so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none had ever returned; lending him not merely a few of their allied night-gaunts, but their entire army as they encamped, veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled night-gaunts alike, save only a small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged rock in the sea. They would set out through the air whenever he might wish, and once arrived on Kadath a suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earth\u2019s gods in their onyx castle. Moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words, Carter made plans with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage. The army would fly high, they decided, over hideous Leng with its nameless monastery and wicked stone villages; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the shantak-frightening night-gaunts whose burrows honeycombed their summits."}

It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \u201cThere was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eat\u2019g off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\u201d What did this signify? But wait\u2014was there not still another reference to \u201cguards\u201d in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had \u2018eaten their heads off\u2019, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \u201csalts\u201d to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could? So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \u201cMateria\u201d\u2014in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too\u2014and if not the salts of \u201cguards\u201d, then the salts of what? God!"}

It is said that he who walks on them can never return to his home shore. As the White Ship sailed quietly away from the terraces with temples of Zar, we saw the tall towers of a great [THING] on the far horizon ahead. The bearded [THING] said to me: \" This is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders. All those mysteries that [THING] has tried. Failed to understand live there. \" I looked again, from closer. I saw the [THING] was greater than any [THING] I had known. Dreamed of before. The towers of its temples reached into the [THING]. No [THING] could see their tops. The grim, grey walls stretched far back beyond the horizon. Over them, one could see only a few roofs. They were strange and threatening, yet decorated with rich carvings and tempting sculptures. I wanted very much to enter this [THING]. It was both attractive and frightening. I asked the bearded [THING] to put me ashore at the [THING] dock by the huge carved gate Akariel. But he gently said no. He said: \" Into Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have gone. None have come back. Only demons and mad things that are no longer men walk there. The streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have seen the idol Lathi. That idol rules over the [THING]. \". The White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion. For many days we followed a [THING] flying south. Its shiny feathers were the color of the [THING] it came from. Then we came to a pleasant coast bright with flowers of every color. As far inland as we could see, lovely woods. Bright shelters lay in the midday [THING]. From hidden places came bursts of song and pieces of beautiful music. There was also soft laughter so lovely that I urged the rowers to go faster. I was eager to reach the place. The bearded [THING] said nothing. He watched me as we neared the shore lined with lilies. Suddenly a [THING] blew from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods. It brought a smell that made me shake. The [THING] grew stronger. The air filled with the deadly, grave - like smell of towns struck by plague. As we sailed wildly away from that cursed coast, the bearded [THING] finally spoke. He said: \" This is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained. \".\n###\nBut we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of Zar, for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore. As the White Ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of Zar, we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city; and the bearded man said to me: \u201cThis is Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom.\u201d And I looked again, at closer range, and saw that the city was greater than any city I had known or dreamed of before. Into the sky the spires of its temples reached, so that no man might behold their peaks; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim, grey walls, over which one might spy only a few roofs, weird and ominous, yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures. I yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city, and besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate Akariel; but he gently denied my wish, saying: \u201cInto Thalarion, the City of a Thousand Wonders, many have passed but none returned. Therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men, and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon Lathi, that reigns over the city.\u201d So the White Ship sailed on past the walls of Thalarion, and followed for many days a southward-flying bird, whose glossy plumage matched the sky out of which it had appeared. Then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue, where as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbours beneath a meridian sun. From bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and snatches of lyric harmony, interspersed with faint laughter so delicious that I urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene. And the bearded man spoke no word, but watched me as we approached the lily-lined shore. Suddenly a wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which I trembled. The wind grew stronger, and the air was filled with the lethal, charnel odour of plague-stricken towns and uncovered cemeteries. And as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last, saying: \u201cThis is Xura, the Land of Pleasures Unattained.\u201d"}

I was forced to leave for lack of money. Until at I came upon that house in the Rue d'Auseil. It was kept by the Blandot. It was the house from the top of the street. It was by the of them all. My room was on the floor. It was the lived - in room, since the house was. On the night I arrived I heard music from the overhead. The day I asked Blandot about it. He told me it was an violin player. He was a man who signed his name as Erich Zann. He played evenings in a theatre orchestra. He added that Zann 's wish to play in the night after his return from the theatre was the reason he had chosen this high. room. Its window was the point on the street from which one could look over the ending wall at the slope. After that I heard Zann every night. Although he kept me, I was haunted by the strangeness of his music. I knew of the art myself. I was that none of his harmonies had any relation to music I had heard. I concluded that he was a composer of genius. The I listened, the I was. After a week I decided to make the man 's acquaintance. One night, as he was returning from his work, I met Zann in the hallway. I told him that I would like to know him. Be with him when he played. He was a,, person. He had clothes, eyes, a, satyr - face, and a head. At my words he seemed both and. My friendliness,, softneed him. He motioned to me to follow him up the, creaking. stairs. His room was one of two in the sloped. It was on the side, toward the wall that formed the end of the street. Its size was. It seemed because of its emptiness and. Of furniture there was a iron bed, a washstand, a table, a bookcase, an iron music stand. Three - chairs.\n###\nI had been living in many poor places, always evicted for want of money; until at last I came upon that tottering house in the Rue d\u2019Auseil, kept by the paralytic Blandot. It was the third house from the top of the street, and by far the tallest of them all. My room was on the fifth story; the only inhabited room there, since the house was almost empty. On the night I arrived I heard strange music from the peaked garret overhead, and the next day asked old Blandot about it. He told me it was an old German viol-player, a strange dumb man who signed his name as Erich Zann, and who played evenings in a cheap theatre orchestra; adding that Zann\u2019s desire to play in the night after his return from the theatre was the reason he had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room, whose single gable window was the only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyond. Thereafter I heard Zann every night, and although he kept me awake, I was haunted by the weirdness of his music. Knowing little of the art myself, I was yet certain that none of his harmonies had any relation to music I had heard before; and concluded that he was a composer of highly original genius. The longer I listened, the more I was fascinated, until after a week I resolved to make the old man\u2019s acquaintance. One night, as he was returning from his work, I intercepted Zann in the hallway and told him that I would like to know him and be with him when he played. He was a small, lean, bent person, with shabby clothes, blue eyes, grotesque, satyr-like face, and nearly bald head; and at my first words seemed both angered and frightened. My obvious friendliness, however, finally melted him; and he grudgingly motioned to me to follow him up the dark, creaking, and rickety attic stairs. His room, one of only two in the steeply pitched garret, was on the west side, toward the high wall that formed the upper end of the street. Its size was very great, and seemed the greater because of its extraordinary bareness and neglect. Of furniture there was only a narrow iron bedstead, a dingy washstand, a small table, a large bookcase, an iron music-rack, and three old-fashioned chairs."}

The conversation happened in an upper [THING] of Sabin 's Tavern near the docks. Smith was there to confirm almost every statement. It was clear that Capt. Mathewson was very strongly affected. Like almost everyone else in the [THING], he had his own dark suspicions about Joseph Curwen. Therefore, this confirmation and additional information were enough to convince him completely. At the end of the meeting, he was very serious. He instructed the two younger men to keep strict silence. He said he would pass the information separately to about ten of the most educated. Important citizens of Providence. He would find out their opinions and follow whatever avdice they might give. Secrecy would probably be necessary in any case. This was not a matter [THING] police or soldiers could handle. Most importantly, the easily excited public must not know. This was to prevent a repeat of that terrible Salem panic from less than a century before. That panic first brought Curwen here, during these already difficult times. He believed the right [THING] to tell would be Dr. Benjamin West. His pamphlet on the recent transit of Venus showed he was a scholar. Rev. James Manning, President of the College. This group had just moved up from Warren. It was temporarily staying in the new King Street schoolhouse. Thye were waiting for their [THING] on the hill above Presbyterian - Lane to be finished. Also ex - Governor Stephen Hopkins. He had been a member of the Philosophical Society at Newport. He was a [THING] of very broad understanding. Also John Carter, publisher of the Gazette. Also all four of the Brown brothers: John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses. They were the recognized local leaders. Among them, Joseph was a skilled amateur scientist. Also old Dr. Jabez Bowen. His knowledge was extensive. He had much direct experience with Curwen 's strange purchases. Also Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateer of amazing courage and energy. He could be relied on to lead any necessary active measures. These men, if they agreed, might eventually meet for group discussion. The responsibility would lie with them. They would decide whether. Not to inform the Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action. The mission of Capt. Mathewson succeeded beyond his graetest hopes. He found one. Two of the chosen confidants soemwhat doubtful about the possibly horrible side of Weeden 's story. But every single one tohught some kind of secret and coordinated action was necessary.\n###\nThe colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabin\u2019s Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought Curwen hither. The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker; Rev. James Manning, President of the College which had just moved up from Warren and was temporarily housed in the new King Street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above Presbyterian-Lane; ex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical Society at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John Carter, publisher of the Gazette; all four of the Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses, who formed the recognised local magnates, and of whom Joseph was an amateur scientist of parts; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and who had much first-hand knowledge of Curwen\u2019s odd purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed. These men, if favourable, might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action. The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of Weeden\u2019s tale, there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and co\u00f6rdinated action."}

One of these things\u2014which excited several Miskatonic professors profoundly\u2014is a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which Gilman gave to the college museum, save that it is larger, wrought of some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal, and possessed of a singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphics. Archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous brownish stains when found. Foreigners and credulous grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by Joe Mazurewicz as that which he had given poor Gilman many years before. Some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by rats, while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner of Gilman\u2019s old room all the time. Still others, including Joe himself, have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credence. When the slanting wall of Gilman\u2019s room was torn out, the once sealed triangular space between that partition and the house\u2019s north wall was found to contain much less structural debris, even in proportion to its size, than the room itself; though it had a ghastly layer of older materials which paralysed the wreckers with horror. In brief, the floor was a veritable ossuary of the bones of small children\u2014some fairly modern, but others extending back in infinite gradations to a period so remote that crumbling was almost complete."}

They were looking for family history information. They rode a bicycle because the route was remote and difficult. A heavy, cold rain started. The traveler was on a road that seemed unused. It was the shortest way to Arkham. The storm caught them far from any town. The only shelter was an old wooden house. It stood between two large elm trees without leaves. The house was at the bottom of a rocky hill. Distant was the distance from the road. The house looked bad from the first sight. Honest, good houses do not look at travelers in such a sly and haunting way. Also, in family history research, one hears old storise that make such places seem bad. But the storm was so strong that it overcame all doubts. The traveler did not hesitate. They pushed the bicycle up the weedy slope to the closed door. The door seemed both suggestive and secretive.\n###\nIt was to a time-battered edifice of this description that I was driven one afternoon in November, 1896, by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure. I had been travelling for some time amongst the people of the Miskatonic Valley in quest of certain genealogical data; and from the remote, devious, and problematical nature of my course, had deemed it convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season. Now I found myself upon an apparently abandoned road which I had chosen as the shortest cut to Arkham; overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town, and confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden building which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill. Distant though it was from the remnant of a road, the house none the less impressed me unfavourably the very moment I espied it. Honest, wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly, and in my genealogical researches I had encountered legends of a century before which biassed me against places of this kind. Yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples, and I did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive."}

Those rituals filled the old world with waving torches and dying candle flames. They suggested the gas lights of more recent times. They gave our ancestors' dark rooms their weak, shaking hints of thin. Unsure brightness against the coming empty dark. It was also no help to point out the even more surprisingly similar habit of the modern apartment rneter. This is the dreaded. Hard-to-reach ceiling light. \"overhead dome.\" It hides in a teasing way in the plaster. Beams of home's top. When I mentioned this proof, my opponents used it against me. They said it must mean some real, weird difficulty for the simple job. They said it must argue for the harmful action of some strange, forgotten rule of glowing light. This rule was forced into hiding after the coming. Control of the common screw-in bulb. It might very possibly have lived on in worse forms until fairly recent times\u2014. Even until now, waiting for the careless person.\n###\nIt was of no use to demonstrate to such skeptics that the act of illumination differed but little in essence from those primordial rituals of artificial luminance which filled the ancient world with flickering torches and guttering tallow-dips, suggested the gas-jets of more recent epochs, and gave to the darkened chambers of our ancestors their feeble, wavering hints of tenuous and uncertain radiance against the encroaching void. No use, either, to point out the even more startlingly similar practice of the modern apartment-dweller in the dreaded and inaccessible ceiling-fixture or \u201coverhead dome\u201d which lurks mockingly amidst the plaster and joists of the domestic summit.

Remembering our confusion at seeing this huge damage from repairs we thought were finished, I can only be surprised that we kept the appearance of calm that we did. Of course we knew that something was badly wrong. This could be the work quality, the material strentgh, or our own senses. We stayed calm enough to look at the floor, see many cracks very closely. Take a careful set of measurements. These may still help both us and the landlord well. In my case, deep-rooted home habit may have helped. Above all my confusion. Feeling of dirtiness, tehre burned a strong wish to understand more of this ancient flaw. I wanted to know what kind of wetness had soaked. Rotted in this strangely porous sruface. I also wanted to know what connection to the general dampness of its time. Of other times such a unique pattern of decay could have had.\n###\nLooking back to our sensations, and recalling our dazedness at viewing this monstrous disfigurement from renovations we had thought complete, I can only wonder that we preserved the semblance of composure which we did. Of course we knew that something\u2014workmanship, material integrity, or our own perception\u2014was woefully awry; yet we kept enough poise to survey the floor, observe many fissures quite minutely, and take a careful series of measurements which may yet serve both us and the landlord in good stead. In my case, ingrained domestic habit may have helped; for above all my bewilderment and sense of defilement there burned a dominant curiosity to fathom more of this age-old flaw\u2014to know what sort of moisture had seeped and festered in this inexplicably porous surface, and what relation to the general dampness of its time or of other times so unique a configuration of decay could have had."}

A sign of the chronicler's poor nervous health can be seen from their reaction to a strange discovery. The crhonicler made this discovery during one of their night walks. It was the evening of July 11th. A gibbous moon made the mysterious hills look pale. Wandering went a bit beyond their usual limits. They came upon a large stone. This stone seemed very different from any they had encountered before. It was almost completely covered. The chronicler bent down and cleared the sand away with their hands. Later, they studied the object carefully. They used their electric torch to add to the moonlight. Unlike other very large rocks, this one was perfectly square. It had no curved surafces. It also seemed to be made of a dark basaltic substance. This was completely different from the granite, sandstone.

They wore bags or packs hanging from the top of their cone - shaped bodies. They held their head and its support at the level of the cone 's top. But it was raised or lowered. The three limbs tended to rest down on the cone 's sides. They contracted to five feet each when not used. From their speed of reading, writing. Using their machines, I decided their intelligence was than man 's. I saw them. They swarmed in all the rooms and halls. They tended machines in arched rooms. They raced along the roads in boat - shaped cars. I stopped being of them. They seemed to be parts of their surroundings. Individual Differences among tehm began to show. A seemed to be under some kind of control. These, though showing no difference, had a variety of gestures and habits. This set them from the majority and from each.

All this time my role in the dreams seemed to be a bodeless awareness. My sight range was than. I floated about. Yet I was limited to paths and speeds of travel. Not until August, 1915, did any hints of having a body start to trouble me. I say trouble, because the stage was link. It linked my noted body - disgust with the scenes of my visions. For a while my worry during dreams was to avoid looking down at myself. I remember how I was for the lack of mirrors in the rooms. I was bothered by a fact. I saw the tables from a level not below their surfaces. Their height could not be than ten feet. the ureg to look down at mysefl grew and. One night I could not fight it.\n###\nThe objects had no clothing, but wore satchels or knapsacks suspended from the top of the conical trunk. They commonly carried their head and its supporting member at the level of the cone top, although it was frequently raised or lowered. The other three great members tended to rest downward on the sides of the cone, contracted to about five feet each, when not in use. From their rate of reading, writing, and operating their machines (those on the tables seemed somehow connected with thought) I concluded that their intelligence was enormously greater than man\u2019s. Afterward I saw them everywhere; swarming in all the great chambers and corridors, tending monstrous machines in vaulted crypts, and racing along the vast roads in gigantic boat-shaped cars. I ceased to be afraid of them, for they seemed to form supremely natural parts of their environment. Individual differences amongst them began to be manifest, and a few appeared to be under some kind of restraint. These latter, though shewing no physical variation, had a diversity of gestures and habits which marked them off not only from the majority, but very largely from one another. They wrote a great deal in what seemed to my cloudy vision a vast variety of characters\u2014never the typical curvilinear hieroglyphs of the majority. A few, I fancied, used our own familiar alphabet. Most of them worked much more slowly than the general mass of the entities. All this time my own part in the dreams seemed to be that of a disembodied consciousness with a range of vision wider than the normal; floating freely about, yet confined to the ordinary avenues and speeds of travel. Not until August, 1915, did any suggestions of bodily existence begin to harass me. I say harass, because the first phase was a purely abstract though infinitely terrible association of my previously noted body-loathing with the scenes of my visions. For a while my chief concern during dreams was to avoid looking down at myself, and I recall how grateful I was for the total absence of large mirrors in the strange rooms. I was mightily troubled by the fact that I always saw the great tables\u2014whose height could not be under ten feet\u2014from a level not below that of their surfaces. And then the morbid temptation to look down at myself became greater and greater, till one night I could not resist it."}

I hinted to friends that a change might happen to me. I talked about returning memories of my life. listeners thought I was not. This is because all the memories I shared were. They were as might have been learned from my papers. Around the middle of August, I went to Arkham. I reopened my - closed house in Crane St. I set up a device of the appearance. It was built in parts by makers of science equipment in Europe and America. I guarded it from the sight of anyone to understand it. Those who did see it include a workman, a servant, and the housekeeper. They say it was a mix of rods, wheels, and mirrors. It was two feet, one foot, and one foot. The mirror was and curved out. All this is supported by the makers of the parts who can be found. On the evening of Friday, Sept. 26, I sent the housekeeper and the maid until noon the day. Lights burned in the house until. A,, - looking man came in a car. It was 1 a.m. That the lights were seen. At 2:15 a.m., a policeman saw the place was. But the stranger 's car was at the street. By four o'clock, the car was gone. At six o'clock, a, voice on the phone asked Dr. Wilson to come to my house. The voice asked him to bring me out of a faint. This call was a - distance one. It was tracked to a pohne booth in the North Station in Boston. But no sign of the foreigner was found. When the doctor reached my house, he found me in the sitting room. I was in a chair with a table pulled up in front of it.\n###\nThere is tangible proof\u2014in the form of marginal notes\u2014that I went minutely through such things as the Comte d\u2019Erlette\u2019s Cultes des Goules, Ludvig Prinn\u2019s De Vermis Mysteriis, the Unaussprechlichen Kulten of von Junzt, the surviving fragments of the puzzling Book of Eibon, and the dreaded Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred. Then, too, it is undeniable that a fresh and evil wave of underground cult activity set in about the time of my odd mutation. In the summer of 1913 I began to display signs of ennui and flagging interest, and to hint to various associates that a change might soon be expected in me. I spoke of returning memories of my earlier life\u2014though most auditors judged me insincere, since all the recollections I gave were casual, and such as might have been learned from my old private papers. About the middle of August I returned to Arkham and reopened my long-closed house in Crane St. Here I installed a mechanism of the most curious aspect, constructed piecemeal by different makers of scientific apparatus in Europe and America, and guarded carefully from the sight of anyone intelligent enough to analyse it. Those who did see it\u2014a workman, a servant, and the new housekeeper\u2014say that it was a queer mixture of rods, wheels, and mirrors, though only about two feet tall, one foot wide, and one foot thick. The central mirror was circular and convex. All this is borne out by such makers of parts as can be located. On the evening of Friday, Sept. 26, I dismissed the housekeeper and the maid till noon of the next day. Lights burned in the house till late, and a lean, dark, curiously foreign-looking man called in an automobile. It was about 1 a.m. that the lights were last seen. At 2:15 a.m. a policeman observed the place in darkness, but with the stranger\u2019s motor still at the curb. By four o\u2019clock the motor was certainly gone. It was at six that a hesitant, foreign voice on the telephone asked Dr. Wilson to call at my house and bring me out of a peculiar faint. This call\u2014a long-distance one\u2014was later traced to a public booth in the North Station in Boston, but no sign of the lean foreigner was ever unearthed. When the doctor reached my house he found me unconscious in the sitting-room\u2014in an easy-chair with a table drawn up before it."}

And I have had these 150 years more than you to consult these Matters in. But if Willett and Mr. Ward did not show this letter to the mental doctors, they did not hold bakc from acting on it themselves. No amount of clever arguing could change the fact that the strangely bearded. Allen, of whom Charles's wild letter had spoken as such a huge threat, was in close. Evil contact with two beings whom Ward had visited in his travels. Who clearly said they weer survivors. Forms of Cruwen's Salem coworkers. That he saw himself as the rebirth of Joseph Curwen. That he hadmurderous plans against a \"boy\" who could hardly be other than Charles Ward. There was organized horror going on. No matter who had started it, the missing Allne was by this time involved in it. So, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in hospital, Mr. Ward qucikly hired detectives to leran all they could about the mysterious bearded dotcor. Finding where he had come from. What Pawtuxet knew of him. If possible finding out where he was now. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which Charles gave up, he urged them to search Allen's room which had been identified when the patient's things were packed. Getting what clues they could from any items he might have left around. Mr. Ward talked with the deetctives in his son's library. They felt a clear relief when they left it at last. For there seemed to hang about the place a faint sense of evil. Maybe it was what they had heard of the infamous wizard whose picture had once looked out from the paneled mantel. Maybe it was something different. In any case they all partly felt unseen badness which centered in that carved leftover of an older home. Which at times almost rose to strength of a physical presence. Now quickly came that experience which has left its permanent mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett. Has added ten years to the visible age of one whose youth was even then past. Dr. Willett had talked at length with Mr. Had reached an agreement with him on several points which both felt the mental doctors would laugh at.\n###\nHave Confidence in what I saye, for you knowe O. and I have hadd these 150 yeares more than you to consulte these Matters in. But if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charles\u2019s frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of Curwen\u2019s old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained\u2014or was at least advised to entertain\u2014murderous designs against a \u201cboy\u201d who could scarcely be other than Charles Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had started it, the missing Allen was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor; finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible discovering his current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which Charles yielded up, he urged them to explore Allen\u2019s vacant room which had been identified when the patient\u2019s belongings had been packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his son\u2019s old library, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation. And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule."}

These are worlds whose simple existence shocks the mind. It makes us numb with the black gaps outside the cosmos. It opens these gaps before our frantic eyes. I strongly doubt that Ammi purposely lied to me. I also do not believe his story was entirely a product of insanity. The townspeople had warned me about that. Something Something awful arrived in the hills and valleys on that meteor. Something terrible remains there still. I do not know how much remains. I will be happy to see the water arrive. In meantime, I hope nothing happens to Ammi. He observed so much of the thing. Its effect was veyr sneaky. Why has he never managed to leave? How well he remembered those final words of Nahum. \"Can't get away... It draws you... You know something is coming. It is no use...\" Ammi is such a good old man. When the reservoir crew begins work, I must write to the head engineer. I must tell him to watch Ammi closely. I would dislike thinking of him as the gray, twisted, fragile monster. That image troubles my sleep more and more often. My recent reading has taken me back to Roman times. I read James Rhoades' Aeneid. I had never read this translation before. It is more faithful to P. Maro than any other poetic version I have seen. This includes the version by my late uncle Dr. Clark. His version was not published. This This Virgilian distraction, along with the ghostly thoughts from All Hallows' Eve, produced a Roman dream in me last Monday night. The hill Witch-Sabbaths contributed too. The dream had superhuman clarity and vividness. It had huge hints of hidden horror. I truly believe I will use it in a story someday. Roman dreams were not rare in my youth. I used to follow the Divine Julius all over Gallia as a Tribunus Militum at night. But I had not had such dreams for so long. So recent one affected me with unusual power. It was a burning snuset or late afternoon. It was in the small country town of Pompelo. The town is at the base of the Pyrenees in Hispania Citerior. The year was likely in the late republic. The province was still governed by a senatorial proconsul. It was not yet ruled by a praetorian legate of Augustus. The day was the one before the Kalends of November.\n###\nIt was just a colour out of space\u2014a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all Nature as we know it; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black extra-cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes. I doubt very much if Ammi consciously lied to me, and I do not think his tale was all a freak of madness as the townfolk had forewarned. Something terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor, and something terrible\u2014though I know not in what proportion\u2014still remains. I shall be glad to see the water come. Meanwhile I hope nothing will happen to Ammi. He saw so much of the thing\u2014and its influence was so insidious. Why has he never been able to move away? How clearly he recalled those dying words of Nahum\u2019s\u2014\u201ccan\u2019t git away . . . draws ye . . . ye know summ\u2019at\u2019s comin\u2019, but \u2019tain\u2019t no use. . . .\u201d Ammi is such a good old man\u2014when the reservoir gang gets to work I must write the chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him. I would hate to think of him as the grey, twisted, brittle monstrosity which persists more and more in troubling my sleep. I have myself been carried back to Roman times by my recent perusal of James Rhoades\u2019 \u00c6neid, a translation never before read by me, and more faithful to P. Maro than any other versified version I have ever seen\u2014including that of my late uncle Dr. Clark, which did not attain publication. This Virgilian diversion, together with the spectral thoughts incident to All Hallows\u2019 Eve with its Witch-Sabbaths on the hills, produced in me last Monday night a Roman dream of such supernal clearness and vividness, and such titanic adumbrations of hidden horror, that I verily believe I shall some day employ it in fiction. Roman dreams were no uncommon features of my youth\u2014I used to follow the Divine Julius all over Gallia as a Tribunus Militum o\u2019nights\u2014but I had so long ceased to experience them, that the present one impressed me with extraordinary force. It was a flaming sunset or late afternoon in the tiny provincial town of Pompelo, at the foot of the Pyrenees in Hispania Citerior. The year must have been in the late republic, for the province was still ruled by a senatorial proconsul instead of a pr\u00e6torian legate of Augustus, and the day was the first before the Kalends of November."}

He went to the window to check the damage. When he took down the shutter, the wind and rain howled. I could not hear what he said. But I waited while he leaned out. He tried to understand Nature 's chaos. a calming of the wind. A clearing of the darkness told of the storm 's passing. I had hoped it would last into the night. This would help our serach. But a sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed that likelihood. Suggesting to Munroe that we had get some light if showers came, I unbarred. Opened the door. The ground was a msas of mud and pools. There were piles of earth from a landslide. I saw nothing to justify the interest that kept my companion leaning out the window. Crossing to where he leaned, I touched his shoulder. But he did not move., as I shook him and turned him around, I felt it. I felt the strangling vines of a horror. Its roots reached into pasts and deeps of the night. This night broods beyond time. On storm - tossed night of November 8, 1921, I stood with a lantern. It cast shadows. I stood digging and in the grave of Jan Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon because a thunderstorm was brewing..\n###\nAt the same time the wolfish wind rose to daemoniac crescendoes of ululation. We were sure that the lone tree on Maple Hill had been struck again, and Munroe rose from his box and went to the tiny window to ascertain the damage. When he took down the shutter the wind and rain howled deafeningly in, so that I could not hear what he said; but I waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom Nature\u2019s pandemonium. Gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness told of the storm\u2019s passing. I had hoped it would last into the night to help our quest, but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed the likelihood of such a thing. Suggesting to Munroe that we had better get some light even if more showers came, I unbarred and opened the crude door. The ground outside was a singular mass of mud and pools, with fresh heaps of earth from the slight landslide; but I saw nothing to justify the interest which kept my companion silently leaning out the window. Crossing to where he leaned, I touched his shoulder; but he did not move. Then, as I playfully shook him and turned him around, I felt the strangling tendrils of a cancerous horror whose roots reached into illimitable pasts and fathomless abysms of the night that broods beyond time. On the tempest-racked night of November 8, 1921, with a lantern which cast charnel shadows, I stood digging alone and idiotically in the grave of Jan Martense. I had begun to dig in the afternoon, because a thunderstorm was brewing, and now that it was dark and the storm had burst above the maniacally thick foliage I was glad. I believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August 5th; the daemon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment, and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm. After that thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not understand. I knew that others could not understand either, so let them think Arthur Munroe had wandered away. They searched, but found nothing. The squatters might have understood, but I dared not frighten them more. I myself seemed strangely callous. That shock at the mansion had done something to my brain, and I could think only of the quest for a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination; a quest which the fate of Arthur Munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitary."}

He ran from a things he could not be about. The houses of smell had furniture made of stools. Benches carved from moon - trees. The insides were painted with and designs. weapons, tools, and decorations were left. This included some ruby statues showing beings not from earth. These statues, though made of ruby, did not make anyone want to take them. Look at them. Carter took the time to smash five of them into pieces. He gathered the scattered spears and javelins. With Pickman 's agreement, he gave them to the ghouls. These tools were to the dog - creatures. But their design made them to learn after a instructions. The parts of the rock had temples than houses. In rooms, they found carved altars. They found fonts. Shrines with stains of origin for worshipping things than the gods on Kadath. From the back of one temple, a passage stretched out. Carter followed it into the rock with a torch. He came to a hall. The ceiling had carvings. In the center was a bottomless well like the one in the monastery of Leng. Taht is where the - priest who can not be described lives. On the side, past the, he thought he saw a door made of worked bronze. For some reason, he felt a fear of opening it. going near it. He hurried through the cave to his allies. They moved with an ease and freedom he could feel. The ghouls had seen the activities of the moon - beasts. They had learned from them in their way. They found a barrel of moon - wine. They were rolling it to the docks to take. They planned to use it in talks with others. But the rescued three people remembered its effect on them in Dylath - Leen. They warned their group not to taste any of it. There was a amount of rubies from moon mines in a vault near the water. They were and. When the ghouls found they were not to eat, they lost all interest in them.\n###\nCarter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive, and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive. The stench-filled houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from moon-trees, and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs. Countless weapons, implements, and ornaments lay about; including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the earth. These latter did not, despite their material, invite either appropriation or long inspection; and Carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces. The scattered spears and javelins he collected, and with Pickman\u2019s approval distributed among the ghouls. Such devices were new to the dog-like lopers, but their relative simplicity made them easy to master after a few concise hints. The upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes, and in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than the mild gods atop Kadath. From the rear of one great temple stretched a low black passage which Carter followed far into the rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions, whose vaultings were covered with daemoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous monastery of Leng where broods alone the high-priest not to be described. On the distant shadowy side, beyond the noisome well, he thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze; but for some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even approaching it, and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel. The ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the moon-beasts, and had profited in their fashion. They had also found a hogshead of potent moon-wine, and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings, though the rescued trio, remembering its effect on them in Dylath-Leen, had warned their company to taste none of it. Of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store, both rough and polished, in one of the vaults near the water; but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them."}

Acting almost without thinking, I went near the porcelain pot. Let the dark liquid pour into the waiting, steaming cup. The roasted smell was strong and not subtle. In the depths of the black liquid, among swirling shadows, I saw a deep richness that clearly promised to wake me up. I felt a strange sense of dislike for the pale, soaked drink. But I kept it down as I carefully breathed in the fumes. I found a still-warm carafe on shelf. I brought it over to the polished table to provide for my refill. Then, preparing myself, I lifted the wide, ceramic-covered pot to my lips. Half made lively by the ever-present smell. Covered with a fine, ghostly layer of oils, I tasted. Began to recognize the deep bitterness that rose inot my senses. I had no sweetener, but I drank respectfully with my sense of taste. After a thoughtful pause I felt a moving clarity inside. A little thinking showed its ancient good quality. It opened inward. Beyond it I saw a faintly remembered enregy moving through tired veins.\n###\nActing almost without conscious volition, I approached the porcelain vessel and let the dark elixir pour into the waiting, steam-wreathed cup.

It opened inward, and beyond it I perceived a dimly remembered vitality coursing through weary veins."}

It was at least midnight when Birch decided he could fit through the window. Tired and sweating, even after many breaks, the observer climbed down to the floor. He sat on the bottom box to get strength for the final move. Jump to the ground outside. The hungry horse kept neighing in a strange way. He vaguely wanted it to stop. The chronicler was not happy about his coming escape. He almost feared the effort, because his body was heavy. Lazy from early middle age. The researcher climbed back onto the splitting coffins. He felt his weight strongly. This was especially true when he reached the top coffin. He heard a loud crack that means wood is breaking completely. It seems he planned poorly when he picked the strongest coffin to stand on. As soon as all his weight was on it again, the rotting lid broke.

Tired and perspiring despite many rests, he descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside. The hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily, and he vaguely wished it would stop. He was curiously unelated over his impending escape, and almost dreaded the exertion, for his form had the indolent stoutness of early middle age. As he remounted the splitting coffins he felt his weight very poignantly; especially when, upon reaching the topmost one, he heard that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood.

Secrecy and hiding seemed common in this quiet city of outsiders and death. I could not shake the feeling of being watched from hidden places by clever, wide-open eyes that never closed. I trembled as the broken sound of three o'colck came from a bell tower on my left. I remembered the low, wide church where that sound came from very well. Moving toward the river, I now entered a new area of old factories and businesses. I saw the remains of a factory ahead and others further on. I also saw signs of an old train station. A covered railway bridge further up the gorge on my right. The unsteady bridge in frotn of me had a warning sign. I took the chance. Crossed again to the south bank. There, signs of life appeared again. Strange, shuffling people stared at me in a puzzling way. More normal faces looked at me coldly and with curiosity. The situation was quickly becoming unbearable. I turned onto Paine Street Street toward the Square area, hoping to find a vehicle to take me to Arkham before the still-far-off departure time of that frightening bus. It was then that I saw the broken-down fire station on my left. I noticed the red-faced, thick-bearded, watery-eyed old man in worn-out clothes. He sat on a bench in front of the station talking with two messy. This, of course, must be Zadok Allen, the half-mad, alcoholic man in his nineties. His stories about old Innsmouth and its shadow were so horrible and unbelievable. It must have been some mischievous urgethat made me change my plans as I did. I had long ago decided to only look at buildings. I was even then rushing toward the Square area to try to get quick transport out of this rotting city of death. The sight of old Zadok Allen created new thuoghts in my mind. Made me slow my steps uncertainly. I had been told the old man could olny suggest wild, confused, and unbelievable stories. I had been warned that the local people made it dangerous to be seen talking to him. The idea of this old witness to the town's decay, with memories going back to the early days of ships. Factories, was a temptation that no amount of logic could make me refuse.\n###\nFurtiveness and secretiveness seemed universal in this hushed city of alienage and death, and I could not escape the sensation of being watched from ambush on every hand by sly, staring eyes that never shut. I shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left. Too well did I recall the squat church from which those notes came. Following Washington Street toward the river, I now faced a new zone of former industry and commerce; noting the ruins of a factory ahead, and seeing others, with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond, up the gorge on my right. The uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign, but I took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared. Furtive, shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction, and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously. Innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable, and I turned down Paine Street toward the Square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to Arkham before the still-distant starting-time of that sinister bus. It was then that I saw the tumbledown fire station on my left, and noticed the red-faced, bushy-bearded, watery-eyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormal-looking firemen. This, of course, must be Zadok Allen, the half-crazed, liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old Innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible. It must have been some imp of the perverse\u2014or some sardonic pull from dark, hidden sources\u2014which made me change my plans as I did. I had long before resolved to limit my observations to architecture alone, and I was even then hurrying toward the Square in an effort to get quick transportation out of this festering city of death and decay; but the sight of old Zadok Allen set up new currents in my mind and made me slacken my pace uncertainly. I had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild, disjointed, and incredible legends, and I had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking to him; yet the thought of this aged witness to the town\u2019s decay, with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories, was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist."}

The [THING] was clear. The [THING] was now very small. Would not rise until very late. As I lay there, I thought of Denys Barry. What would happen to that swamp when day came. I felt a strong urge to run out into the night. I wanted to take Barry 's [THING]. Drive wildly to Ballylough, away from the threatened lands. But before my fear could turn into action, I fell asleep. In my dreams, I saw the [THING] in the valley. It was cold and dead under a covering of horrible shadow. I think it was the high - pitched piping that woke me. But thta piping was not the first thing I noticed when I opened my eyes. I was lying with my back to the east [THING]. That [THING] overlooked the swamp where the small [THING] would rise. So I expected to see light on the [THING] in front of me. But I did not expect to see what now appeared. Light did glow on the [THING] panels ahead. But it was not any light from the [THING]. A bright and sharp beam of red light streamed through the Gothic [THING]. The wohle [THING] was bright with an intense and unnatural splendor. My first actions were strange for such a situation. But only in stories does a [THING] do the dramatic and expected thing. Instead of looking out across the swamp toward the new light 's source, I kept my eyes away from the [THING] in panic fear. I clumsily put on my clothes with some confused idea of escaping. I remember grabbing my [THING] and hat. But before it was over, I lost them both. I did not frie the [THING] or put on the hat. After a time, the red light 's fascination overcame my fear. I crept to the east [THING] and looked otu. The maddening, constant piping whined and echoed through the castle and over all the [THING]. Over the swamp was a flood of flaring light. It was scarlet and evil. It poured from the strange ancient ruin on the far small island. I can not describe how that ruin looked. I must have been crazy. It seemed to rise tall and not decayed. It was splendid and surrounded by columns. The flame - reflecting marble of its upper part pierced the [THING] like the top of a temple on a [THING] peak.\n###\nI retired early and full of dread, and for a long time could not sleep in the uncanny silence of the tower. It was very dark, for although the sky was clear the moon was now well in the wane, and would not rise till the small hours. I thought as I lay there of Denys Barry, and of what would befall that bog when the day came, and found myself almost frantic with an impulse to rush out into the night, take Barry\u2019s car, and drive madly to Ballylough out of the menaced lands. But before my fears could crystallise into action I had fallen asleep, and gazed in dreams upon the city in the valley, cold and dead under a shroud of hideous shadow. Probably it was the shrill piping that awaked me, yet that piping was not what I noticed first when I opened my eyes. I was lying with my back to the east window overlooking the bog, where the waning moon would rise, and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite wall before me; but I had not looked for such a sight as now appeared. Light indeed glowed on the panels ahead, but it was not any light that the moon gives. Terrible and piercing was the shaft of ruddy refulgence that streamed through the Gothic window, and the whole chamber was brilliant with a splendour intense and unearthly. My immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation, but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing. Instead of looking out across the bog toward the source of the new light, I kept my eyes from the window in panic fear, and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of escape. I remember seizing my revolver and hat, but before it was over I had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other. After a time the fascination of the red radiance overcame my fright, and I crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening, incessant piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the village. Over the bog was a deluge of flaring light, scarlet and sinister, and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet. The aspect of that ruin I cannot describe\u2014I must have been mad, for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed, splendid and column-cinctured, the flame-reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a mountain-top."}

One crosses the gorge again on the Main Street bridg.e One enters a completely deserted area. It causes a shiver for some reason. Collapsing groups of gambrel roofs make a rough and strange skyline. Above them rises the scary, headless steeple of an old cuhrch. Some houses along Main Street have people living in them. But most are closed up with boards. On Down unpaved side streets one can see the black, open windows of empty small houses. Many of these lean at dangerous and hard-to-believe angles. This is because part of their foundations has snuk. Those windows look so ghostly that it requires courgae to turn east toward the waterfront. __ENT4__, it is noted that the fear from one empty house grows much faster when many houses form a city of complete emptiness. Seeing such long streets of empty, dead-looking spaces makes one think. The thought is of endless connected black rooms full of spider webs, memories, and decay. This is known to start deep, old fears and dislikes. Even the strongest philosophy cannot remove them.\n###\nRe-crossing the gorge on the Main Street bridge, I struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder. Collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline, above which rose the ghoulish, decapitated steeple of an ancient church. Some houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse."}

Not long after the teachers banned his work, West told the observer his plan. He planned to get new human bodies somehow. He would continue his experiments in secret since he could not do them openly anymore. Hearing him talk about methods was quite scary. At the college, they never got dead bodies for study themselves. When the morgue did not have enough, two local black men handled this task. They were rarely asked questions. West was then a small, thin young man with glasses. He had fine features, yellow hair, pale blue eyes, and a soft voice. It was strange to hear him talk about the good. Bad points of Christchurch Cemetery. The potter's field. They finally chose the potter's field. This was because almost every body in Christchurch was embalmed. That would ruin West's research.\n###\nIt was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that West confided to me his resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner, and continue in secret the experiments he could no longer perform openly. To hear him discussing ways and means was rather ghastly, for at the college we had never procured anatomical specimens ourselves. Whenever the morgue proved inadequate, two local negroes attended to this matter, and they were seldom questioned. West was then a small, slender, spectacled youth with delicate features, yellow hair, pale blue eyes, and a soft voice, and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the relative merits of Christchurch Cemetery and the potter\u2019s field. We finally decided on the potter\u2019s field, because practically every body in Christchurch was embalmed; a thing of course ruinous to West\u2019s researches."}

When I returned home in the growing twilight, I had sworn to the hundred gods of the woods. I swore that I would force my way into the black, cold depths that seemed to call to me, no matter cost. The doctor with the iron-grey beard who visits me daily once told a visitor this decision was the start of a sad obsession. But I will let my readers make the final judgment after they learn everything. The months after my discovery were spent in useless attempts to open the complicated padlock on the slightly open vault. I also made careful, guarded questions about the structure's nature and history. Like any small boy, I listened well and learned much. I was secretive by habit. I told no one what I learned. What I planned to do. It may be worth saying I was not surprisde. Scared when I learned what the vault was. My unusual ideas about life. Death made me connect cold clya with living bodies in a vague way. I felt the great. Sinister family from the burned mansion was somehow present in the stone space I wanted to explore. Mumbled stories of strange rituals. Godless parties from long ago in the old hall gave me a new, strong interset in the tomb. I would sit for hours each day before its door. Once I pushed a candle insdie the nearly closed entrance. I could only see a set of damp stone steps going down. The smell of the place both repelled and fascinated me. I felt I had known it before, in a past too distnat to remember. It was even before I lived in the body I have no.w The year aftre I first saw the tomb, I found a worm-eaten translation of Plutarch's Lives in my home's book-filled attic. Reading the life of Theseus, I was very impressed by a passage. It told of a great stone. The young hero would find his tokens of destiny under it when he was old enough to lift its huge weight. This story made my strongest impatience to enter the vault fade. It made me feel the time was not yet right.\n###\nAt first curious, I was now frantic; and when in the thickening twilight I returned to my home, I had sworn to the hundred gods of the grove that at any cost I would some day force an entrance to the black, chilly depths that seemed calling out to me. The physician with the iron-grey beard who comes each day to my room once told a visitor that this decision marked the beginning of a pitiful monomania; but I will leave final judgment to my readers when they shall have learnt all. The months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure. With the traditionally receptive ears of the small boy, I learned much; though an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one of my information or my resolve. It is perhaps worth mentioning that I was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault. My rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion; and I felt that the great and sinister family of the burned-down mansion was in some way represented within the stone space I sought to explore. Mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb, before whose door I would sit for hours at a time each day. Once I thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance, but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward. The odour of the place repelled yet bewitched me. I felt I had known it before, in a past remote beyond all recollection; beyond even my tenancy of the body I now possess. The year after I first beheld the tomb, I stumbled upon a worm-eaten translation of Plutarch\u2019s Lives in the book-filled attic of my home. Reading the life of Theseus, I was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight. This legend had the effect of dispelling my keenest impatience to enter the vault, for it made me feel that the time was not yet ripe."}

For some unclear reason, he tried to walk softly, even though it made him slower. On this deepest floor, there was an area he was scared to cross. As he got closer, he remembered what he feared in that area. It was just one of the metal-barred trap-doors that were usually well guarded. There would be no guards now. Because of that he shook. Walked on his toes. He had done the same when passing through the blcak basalt room where a similar trap-door had been open. He felt a flow of cool, damp air, like he had felt there. He wished he was going a different way. He did not know why he had to go this specific way.\n###\nEventually I reached the lowest level and struck off to the right of the incline.

It was merely one of the metal-barred and closely guarded trap-doors.

We certainly did not mean to face what we feared\u2014yet I will not deny that we may have had a lurking, unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden vantage-point. Probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself, though there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great circular place shewn on the crumpled sketches we had found. We had at once recognised it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in the very earliest carvings, but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture from above. Something about the impressiveness of its rendering, even in these hasty diagrams, made us think that its sub-glacial levels must still form a feature of peculiar importance. Perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet unencountered by us. It was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures in which it figured\u2014being indeed among the first things built in the city. Its carvings, if preserved, could not but be highly significant. Moreover, it might form a good present link with the upper world\u2014a shorter route than the one we were so carefully blazing, and probably that by which those others had descended. At any rate, the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches\u2014which quite perfectly confirmed our own\u2014and start back over the indicated course to the circular place; the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed twice before us. The other neighbouring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that.

Red Aldebaran moves low around the horizon, there has been nothing. [THING] for thousands of years. They say there has nveer been a [THING] there except short yellow creatures, harmed by the cold, whom they call \" Esquimaux \". I have often wondered if most [THING] ever stop to think about the sometimes huge importance of dreams. Of the hidden world to which they belong. Whilst most of our night visions are perhaps only weak. Strange copies of our waking experiencesthere are still some left whose unearthly. Light character allows no normal explanation. Their vaguely exciting. Worrying effect suggests possible small looks into a world of mental life no less important than physical life. Separated from that life by a nearly impassable [THING]. From my experience I can not doubt that [THING], when lost to [THING] consciousness, is truly staying in anohter. Bodiless life of a very difefrent nature from the life we know. Only the smallest and most unclear memories remain after waking. From those unclear and broken memories we can guess much, yet prove little. We may guess that in dreams, life, matter. Energy, as the [THING] knows such things, are not always constant. We may guess that time. Space do not exist as our waking selves understand them. Sometimes I believe that this less physical life is our truer life. That our useless presence on the [THING]. Earth golbe is itself the secondary. Only seeming event. It was from a young daydream filled with thoughts of this kind that I got up one afternoon in the winter of 1900\u20131901. At that time, to the state mental hospital where I worked as a trainee doctor, was brought the [THING] whose case has haunted me. Constantly ever since. His name, as written on the records, was Joe Slater, or Slaader. His appearance was that of the typical [THING] from the Catskill Mountain area. He was one of those strange, ugly children of an early settler farmer family. Their separation for almost three hundred years in the hilly strongholds of a little - visited countryside has caused them to fall into a kind of savage decline, rather than improve with their more lucky brothers in the heavily populated areas.\n###\nThey say there is no land of Lomar, save in my nocturnal imaginings; that in those realms where the Pole Star shines high and red Aldebaran crawls low around the horizon, there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years, and never a man save squat yellow creatures, blighted by the cold, whom they call \u201cEsquimaux\u201d. I have frequently wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams, and of the obscure world to which they belong. Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences\u2014Freud to the contrary with his puerile symbolism\u2014there are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permits of no ordinary interpretation, and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life, yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier. From my experience I cannot doubt but that man, when lost to terrestrial consciousness, is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know; and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking. From those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much, yet prove little. We may guess that in dreams life, matter, and vitality, as the earth knows such things, are not necessarily constant; and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend them. Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon. It was from a youthful reverie filled with speculations of this sort that I arose one afternoon in the winter of 1900\u20131901, when to the state psychopathic institution in which I served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly. His name, as given on the records, was Joe Slater, or Slaader, and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the Catskill Mountain region; one of those strange, repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of a little-travelled countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy, rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts."}

Common sense suggested the safest course was to learn as much as possible before waking anyone. After returning to the hall, the living room door was silently closed and latched. This reduced the chance of waking Noyes. One then carefully entered the study. One expected to find Akeley there, asleep or awake, in the corner chair.

On side streets, I saw the, windows of abandoned houses. of these houses leaned at. angles because part of their foundations had sunk. Those windows looked that I needed courage to turn toward the waterfront. In, the fear caused by a house grows when houses form a city of emptiness. Seeing streets of, - looking buildings. Thinking about connecetd rooms of spiderwebs, memories. Decay, stirs up, fears. the philosophy can not make these feelings go. Fish Street was as Main. It was because it had brick. Stone warehouses in condition. Water Street was the, except there were spaces facing the sea where wharves uesd to be. I did not see any living thing, except for some scattered fishermen on the breakwater. I did not hear any sound, except for the movement of the harbor tides. The noise of the falls in the Manuxet. The town was making me and. I looked behind me as I walked over the Water Street birdge. The The Fish Street bridge, based on the sketch, was in condition. On the north side of the river, there were signs of life \u2014 fish - packing houses in Water Street, smoking chimneys. roofs., sounds from sources., - moving shapes in the streets., I found this than the area to the south. One reason was that the people were. than those near the center of town. This made me think, in a way, of something that I could not remember. the ancestry in the Innsmouth people was than. Unless, of course, the \" Innsmouth look \" was a sickness than a bloodline. In that case, this area might contain cases. One detail that bothered me was how the sounds I heard were spread out. They should have come from the houses that had people living in them. In reality, the sounds were inside the houses with the boarded - up fronts.\n###\nSome houses along Main Street were tenanted, but most were tightly boarded up. Down unpaved side streets I saw the black, gaping windows of deserted hovels, many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations. Those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront. Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given over to cobwebs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse. Fish Street was as deserted as Main, though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape. Water Street was almost its duplicate, save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been. Not a living thing did I see, except for the scattered fishermen on the distant breakwater, and not a sound did I hear save the lapping of the harbour tides and the roar of the falls in the Manuxet. The town was getting more and more on my nerves, and I looked behind me furtively as I picked my way back over the tottering Water Street bridge. The Fish Street bridge, according to the sketch, was in ruins. North of the river there were traces of squalid life\u2014active fish-packing houses in Water Street, smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there, occasional sounds from indeterminate sources, and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes\u2014but I seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion. For one thing, the people were more hideous and abnormal than those near the centre of the town; so that I was several times evilly reminded of something utterly fantastic which I could not quite place. Undoubtedly the alien strain in the Innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inland\u2014unless, indeed, the \u201cInnsmouth look\u201d were a disease rather than a blood strain, in which case this district might be held to harbour the more advanced cases. One detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds I heard.

This was the information that troubled us as we stubbornly finished restoring our family home. Do not think these stories were our main mental influence. Instead, we were often praised and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who helped us. The work took over two years. When it was done, we looked at the great rooms, paneled walls, arched ceilings, windowed windows. We felt proud. This pride fully made up for the huge cost of the restoration. Every feature of the Middle Ages was skillfully copied. The new parts fit perfectly with the original walls and foundations. Our ancestors' home was complete. We hoped to finally restore the local reputation of the family line that ended with us. We would live here forever. We would prove that a de la Poer does not have to be evil. Our comfort was perhaps increased because. Exham Priory was fitted in a medieval style, its inside was actually completely new. It was free from old pests and old ghosts.\n###\nSuch was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an elderly obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home. It must not be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environment. On the other hand, I was constantly praised and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me. When the task was done, over two years after its commencement, I viewed the great rooms, wainscotted walls, vaulted ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration. Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced, and the new parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations. The seat of my fathers was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the line which ended in me. I would reside here permanently, and prove that a de la Poer (for I had adopted again the original spelling of the name) need not be a fiend. My comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that, although Exham Priory was mediaevally fitted, its interior was in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alike."}

But the earliest stories said the creatures only hurt people who entered their private places. Later stories tolld of their interest in humans. They tried to SET up secret stations in the human world. There were tales of strange claw marks found naer farmhouse windows in the morning. There were occasional disappearances in areas not known to be haunteed. Tales also told of buzzing voices copying human speech. These voices made surprising offers to lone travelers on roads in the deep woods. Children were terrified by things seen. Heard whhere the ancient forest came near their homes. The newest layer of legends came just before people stopped believing in superstitions. They stopped going near the feared places. These legends tell of shocked mentions of hermits and remote farmers. These people seemed to have a disgusting change of mind at some point in their lives. People avoided them and whispered about them. They were said to have sold themselves to the strange beings. In ONE northeastern county around 1800, it became common to blame odd and disliked loners. They were accused of being friends or agents of the hated things.\n###\nBut while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men, and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world. There were tales of the queer claw-prints seen around farmhouse windows in the morning, and of occasional disappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas. Tales, besides, of buzzing voices in imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travellers on roads and cart-paths in the deep woods, and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their dooryards. In the final layer of legends\u2014the layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close contact with the dreaded places\u2014there are shocked references to hermits and remote farmers who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change, and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings. In one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred things."}

It made a rattling sound. There were three passengers on it. A man on sidewalk looked evil. He muttered some words to the driver. The words weer to understand. Sargent threw out a mail bag. Sargent aslo threw out a roll of newspapers. Then Sargent went into the hotel. The passengers walked to the sidewalk. They were the same men I saw arrive in Newburyport thta morning. They moved in a slow, shuffling way. They spoke some throaty words to a loafer. I believe the language was not English. I got on the bus. I sat in the same seat as before. I had just sat down when Sargent came back. Sargent began to mumble in a throaty voice. The voice was very unpleasant. I was in very luck. There was something wrong with the engine. This was true even though the trip from Newburyport was fast. The bus could not go all the way to Arkham. No, it could not be fixed that night. Also, there was no other way to get a ride out of Innsmouth. This was true for going to Arkham or any other place. Sargent was sorry. I would have to stay at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would give me a price. But there was nothing else I could do. I was dazed by this sudden problem. I also greatly feared the night coming to this town. The town was decaying and had few lights. I left the bus. I went back into the hotel lobby. The night clerk looked sullen and He said I could have room 428. It was on the floor next to the top floor. The room was But it had no running water. The cost was one dollar. I had heard things about this hotel in Newburyport. But I signed the register. I paid my dollar. I let the clerk take my suitcase. I followed the sour, lone attendant. We went up three flights of stairs. The stairs ceraked. We passed dusty hallways. hallways seemde to have no life at all. My room was at the back. It was dismal. It had two windows. The furniture was bare and cheap. The room looked out on a dingy courtyard. The courtyard was surrounded by brick buildings. The view also showed roofs stretching to the west. Beyond that was marshy countryside. At the end of the hall was a bathroom. It was a discouraging relic. It had an marble bowl. It had a tin tub. It had a faint electric Musty wodo panels were around all the pipes. It was still daytime. I went down to the Square. I looked for some kind of dinner. As I did this, I noticed the looks from the unhealthy loafers. The grocery store was closed. So I had to go to the restaurant I avoided before. A stooped man was there. He had a head. His eyes stared and did not blink. A flat-nosed woman was also there. She had unbelievably clumsy hands. They were in attendance.\n###\nThe bus, rather early, rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight, and an evil-looking fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver. Sargent threw out a mail-bag and a roll of newspapers, and entered the hotel; while the passengers\u2014the same men whom I had seen arriving in Newburyport that morning\u2014shambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint guttural words with a loafer in a language I could have sworn was not English. I boarded the empty coach and took the same seat I had taken before, but was hardly settled before Sargent reappeared and began mumbling in a throaty voice of peculiar repulsiveness. I was, it appeared, in very bad luck. There had been something wrong with the engine, despite the excellent time made from Newburyport, and the bus could not complete the journey to Arkham. No, it could not possibly be repaired that night, nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of Innsmouth, either to Arkham or elsewhere. Sargent was sorry, but I would have to stop over at the Gilman. Probably the clerk would make the price easy for me, but there was nothing else to do. Almost dazed by this sudden obstacle, and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and half-unlighted town, I left the bus and re-entered the hotel lobby; where the sullen, queer-looking night clerk told me I could have Room 428 on next the top floor\u2014large, but without running water\u2014for a dollar. Despite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburyport, I signed the register, paid my dollar, let the clerk take my valise, and followed that sour, solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life. My room, a dismal rear one with two windows and bare, cheap furnishings, overlooked a dingy courtyard otherwise hemmed in by low, deserted brick blocks, and commanded a view of decrepit westward-stretching roofs with a marshy countryside beyond. At the end of the corridor was a bathroom\u2014a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl, tin tub, faint electric light, and musty wooden panelling around all the plumbing fixtures. It being still daylight, I descended to the Square and looked around for a dinner of some sort; noticing as I did so the strange glances I received from the unwholesome loafers. Since the grocery was closed, I was forced to patronise the restaurant I had shunned before; a stooped, narrow-headed man with staring, unwinking eyes, and a flat-nosed wench with unbelievably thick, clumsy hands being in attendance."}

This was a somewhat surprising fact givne how far we had gone. On the morning of July 2, we saw a warship flying American colors. The men became very agitated and wanted to surrender. Finally Lieut. Klenze had to shoot a sailor named Traube. He argued for this un - German act very violently. This calmed the crew for a while. We dove without being seen. The next afternoon, a thick group of seabirds came from the south. The [THIGN] began to swell in a threatening way. Closing our hatches, we waited to see what would happen. We realized we must dive or be flooded by the rising waves. Our air pressure and electricity were getting low. We wanted to avoid all unnecessary use of our limited resources. But in this caes, we had no choice. We did not go down far. After several hours, the [THING] was calmer. We decided to go back to the surface. Here, a new problem happened. The ship did not respond to our controls. The mechanics could not fix it. As the men grew more scared of this underwater prison, some began to mutter again about Lieut. Klenze 's ivory statue. The sight of an automatic pistol calmed them. We kept the poor men as busy as possible. We worked on the machinery evne when we knwe it was pointless. Klenze and I usually slept at different times. During my sleep, around 5 A.M. On July 4, a full mutiny started. The six remaining pig - like sailors thought we were lost. They suddenly became furiously angry. They were angry we refused to surrender to the Yankee battleship two days before. They were in a frenzy of cursing and breaking things. They roared like animals. They broke instruments and furniture without care. They screamed about nonsense. They talked of the ivory sattue 's curse. The dark dead youth who looked at them. Lieut. Klenze seemed frozen and useless. One might expect that from soft, womanish Rhinelander. I shot all six men. It was necessary. I made sure none were alive. We pushed the bodies out through the double hatches. We were alone in the U-29. Klenze seemed very anxious and drank a lot. We decided to stay alive as long as we could. We would use the large supply of [THING] and chemical oxygen. None of it was damaged by the crazy actions of those swine - [THING] sailors.\n###\nDolphins still encircled the U-29, a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the distance we had covered. On the morning of July 2 we sighted a warship flying American colours, and the men became very restless in their desire to surrender. Finally Lieut. Klenze had to shoot a seaman named Traube, who urged this un-German act with especial violence. This quieted the crew for the time, and we submerged unseen. The next afternoon a dense flock of sea-birds appeared from the south, and the ocean began to heave ominously. Closing our hatches, we awaited developments until we realised that we must either submerge or be swamped in the mounting waves. Our air pressure and electricity were diminishing, and we wished to avoid all unnecessary use of our slender mechanical resources; but in this case there was no choice. We did not descend far, and when after several hours the sea was calmer, we decided to return to the surface. Here, however, a new trouble developed; for the ship failed to respond to our direction in spite of all that the mechanics could do. As the men grew more frightened at this undersea imprisonment, some of them began to mutter again about Lieut. Klenze\u2019s ivory image, but the sight of an automatic pistol calmed them. We kept the poor devils as busy as we could, tinkering at the machinery even when we knew it was useless. Klenze and I usually slept at different times; and it was during my sleep, about 5 A.M., July 4, that the general mutiny broke loose. The six remaining pigs of seamen, suspecting that we were lost, had suddenly burst into a mad fury at our refusal to surrender to the Yankee battleship two days before; and were in a delirium of cursing and destruction. They roared like the animals they were, and broke instruments and furniture indiscriminately; screaming about such nonsense as the curse of the ivory image and the dark dead youth who looked at them and swam away. Lieut. Klenze seemed paralysed and inefficient, as one might expect of a soft, womanish Rhinelander. I shot all six men, for it was necessary, and made sure that none remained alive. We expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the U-29. Klenze seemed very nervous, and drank heavily. It was decided that we remain alive as long as possible, using the large stock of provisions and chemical supply of oxygen, none of which had suffered from the crazy antics of those swine-hound seamen."}

It might be some unknonw and unclear mass that can change shape. It might change at will to vague forms of solid, liquid, gas. A thin state without particles. The maan-shaped patch of mold on the floor argued for a connection. The form of the yellowish vapor. The curve of the tree-roots in some old stories also argued for it. They argued for at least a distant and memory-like link to the human shape. No one could say with any certainty how close.

This is especially true when no one else knew where he wsa. Maybe it was madness. But that night the observer started to go down without hesitation. Again there was a clear pull and push of fate. This force seemed to have guided his path all along. He flashed the torch on and off to save the battery. He began a wild climb down the dangerous, Cyclopean slope below the opening. Sometimes he faced forward when he found good handholds and footholds. Other times he turned to face the pile of large stones as he held on. Moved less securely. On two sides of him, far-off walls of carved, broken stone were dimly visible in his torchlight. Ahead, however, was only solid blackness.\n###\nIn retrospect, the barest idea of a sudden, lone descent into such a doubtful abyss\u2014and at a time when one\u2019s whereabouts were unknown to any living soul\u2014seems like the utter apex of insanity.

With torch flashing intermittently to save the battery, I commenced a mad scramble down the sinister, Cyclopean incline below the opening\u2014sometimes facing forward as I found good hand and foot holds, and at other times turning to face the heap of megaliths as I clung and fumbled more precariously. In two directions beside me, distant walls of carven, crumbling masonry loomed dimly under the direct beams of my torch. Ahead, however, was only unbroken blackness."}

The subject of the sculptures clearly came from the life of the lost time when they were made. It included a large amount of clear history. It is this unusual historical focus of the ancient race that helped one by chance. This made the carvings very informative. It also caused their photographing and copynig to be put above all else. In some rooms, the main layout was changed by the presence of maps, star charts. Other scientific designs on a larger scale. These things gave a simlpe. Frightening confirmation to what is learned from the picture bands. Lowre wall panels.

They believed series of tunnels and catacombs lay under the farm. Besides the Indian and his wife, a group of people lived. The house was an, relic from middle of the century. It had an stack chimney and diamond - paned lattice windows. The laboratory was in a lean - to on the north side. the roof came to the ground. This building stood from any. Judging by the voices heard at times, it must have been through passages. These voices, before 1766, were mumblings and whisperings and screams. They were coupled with chants or prayers. After that date,, they took on a and character. They ranged from hums of agreement to explosions of pain or anger. There were rumblings of conversation and whines of begging. There were breaths of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in languages. Curwen knew all of them. His accent was in reply, scolding, or threat. it seemed that people must be in the house. These included Cuwren, captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a kind that neither Weeden nor Simth had heard. This was despite their knowledge of places. There were voices they did seem to place as belonging to this. The nature of the conversations seemed a kind of question - and - answer session. It was as if Curwen was forcing some sort of information from. Weeden had word - for - word reports of bits in his notebook. He knew English, French, and Spanish, and they were used. But none of these has survived. Say that besides a talks about the affairs of Providence families, of the questions. Answers he could understand were. They related to places and times. For example, a figure who was raging. was questioned in French. He was asked about the Black Prince 's massacre at Limoges in 1370. It was as if there was some hidden reason he ought to know. Cruwen asked the prisonerwhether the order to kill was given because of the Sign of the Goat foudn on the altar. This was in beneath the Cathedral. Or, he asked whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words.\n###\nIt is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners. Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families were concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in French about the Black Prince\u2019s massacre at Limoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know. Curwen asked the prisoner\u2014if prisoner it were\u2014whether the order to slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the ancient Roman crypt beneath the Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words."}

In Newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to take to Arkham; and it was only at the station ticket-office, when I demurred at the high fare, that I learned about Innsmouth.

And then, by some miracle finding the door and the large wooden bolt, I plunged wildly away from that glassy-eyed thing in the dark, and from the ghoulish howling of that accursed viol whose fury increased even as I plunged. Leaping, floating, flying down those endless stairs through the dark house; racing mindlessly out into the narrow, steep, and ancient street of steps and tottering houses; clattering down steps and over cobbles to the lower streets and the putrid canyon-walled river; panting across the great dark bridge to the broader, healthier streets and boulevards we know; all these are terrible impressions that linger with me. And I recall that there was no wind, and that the moon was out, and that all the lights of the city twinkled. Despite my most careful searches and investigations, I have never since been able to find the Rue d\u2019Auseil. But I am not wholly sorry; either for this or for the loss in undreamable abysses of the closely written sheets which alone could have explained the music of Erich Zann. Of Herbert West, who was my friend in college and in after life, I can speak only with extreme terror. This terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his recent disappearance, but was engendered by the whole nature of his life-work, and first gained its acute form more than seventeen years ago, when we were in the third year of our course at the Miskatonic University Medical School in Arkham. While he was with me, the wonder and diabolism of his experiments fascinated me utterly, and I was his closest companion. Now that he is gone and the spell is broken, the actual fear is greater. Memories and possibilities are ever more hideous than realities. The first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock I ever experienced, and it is only with reluctance that I repeat it. As I have said, it happened when we were in the medical school, where West had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially. His views, which were widely ridiculed by the faculty and his fellow-students, hinged on the essentially mechanistic nature of life; and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes."}

But while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men, and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world. There were tales of the queer claw-prints seen around farmhouse windows in the morning, and of occasional disappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas. Tales, besides, of buzzing voices in imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travellers on roads and cart-paths in the deep woods, and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their dooryards. In the final layer of legends\u2014the layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close contact with the dreaded places\u2014there are shocked references to hermits and remote farmers who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change, and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings. In one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about 1800 to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred things. As to what the things were\u2014explanations naturally varied. The common name applied to them was \u201cthose ones\u201d, or \u201cthe old ones\u201d, though other terms had a local and transient use. Perhaps the bulk of the Puritan settlers set them down bluntly as familiars of the devil, and made them a basis of awed theological speculation. Those with Celtic legendry in their heritage\u2014mainly the Scotch-Irish element of New Hampshire, and their kindred who had settled in Vermont on Governor Wentworth\u2019s colonial grants\u2014linked them vaguely with the malign fairies and \u201clittle people\u201d of the bogs and raths, and protected themselves with scraps of incantation handed down through many generations. But the Indians had the most fantastic theories of all. While different tribal legends differed, there was a marked consensus of belief in certain vital particulars; it being unanimously agreed that the creatures were not native to this earth. The Pennacook myths, which were the most consistent and picturesque, taught that the Winged Ones came from the Great Bear in the sky, and had mines in our earthly hills whence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any other world."}

After the initial grace period all literary activity was confined to the main municipal branch, and the returning of overdue volumes formed the only remaining bit of major obligation aside from the eternal reading. That reading became less and less as the fines accumulated and digital repositories offered competition, but there was never a dearth of books in the library stacks. Patrons seldom lingered there, and there was some discreetly veiled evidence that a number of students and pensioners who had tried it had been removed in a peculiarly drastic fashion."}

We had just recognized old Matt's coffin when the door slammed shut in the wind. This left us in a darkness even deeper than before. narrow window above the door let in only very weak light. The overhead air vent let in almost no ligth at all. We had to fumble clumsily as we moved slowly among the long boxes toward the latch. In this funeral-like half-light, we shook the rusty handles. We puhsed at the iron door panels. We wondered why the heavy door had suddenly become so stubborn. In this half-light, we also began to understand the truth. We shouted loudly as if our horse outside could do more than give an uncaring neigh in reply. The long-ignored latch was clearly broken. This left the careless undertakers trapped in the vault.

The narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays, and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually none at all; so that he was reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward the latch. In this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles, pushed at the iron panels, and wondered why the massive portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant.

For the long-neglected latch was obviously broken, leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault, a victim of his own oversight."}

It is observed that his madness was not liek any type recorded in even the newest. Most complete books. It was combined with a mental force that would have made him a genius. But this force was twisted into strange and odd shapes. Dr. Willett was Ward's family doctor. He says the patient's overall mental ability actually increased after the seizure. This was measured by his response to things outside his madness. One notes that Ward was always a scholar and an antiquarian. Even his best early work did not show the aamzing understanding. Insight he showed during his lats exams by the mental doctors. It was indeed hard to get a legal order to put him in the hospital. The youth's mind seemed so powerful and clear. He was finally confined only because of other people's evidence. Many abnormal gaps in his knowledge, not his intelligence. To the very moment of his vanishing, he is known to have read everything. Talked as much as his weak voice allowed. Observers who did not foresee his escape freley predicted he would soon be released from custody.\n###\nPsychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Ward\u2019s family physician, affirms that the patient\u2019s gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youth\u2019s mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody."}

Lavinai was likely to say such things. She was a lonely person. She liked to walk in the hills during thunderstorms. She tried to read the big, smelly books her father inherited. The books came from two centuries of Whateleys. They were falling apart from age and wroms. She never went to school. But she knew many pieces of old knowledge that Old Whateley taught her.

Whateley happened when Lavinia was twelve years old. This did not make the place more popular. Lavinia grew up among strange influences. She liked wild, grand daydreams and unusual activities.

The noise seemed to come from near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. Most people who heard it said the sound was very loud and strangely unusual. FRED Lemdin, the night watchman at Rhodes, says the howling was mixed with something like the screams of a man in extreme fear. A short and intense thunderstorm, which seemed to hit near the riverbank, ended the noise. People commonly connect Strange. Bad smells, likely from the oil tanks along the bay, with this event. These smells may have also helped to upset the dogs.\n###\nResidents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd, according to most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours, probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with this incident; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs."}

He likely had very simple and healthy bodily functions. Now, with his eyes closed, he looked more asleep than dead. Howwever, my friend's expert testts soon showed he was truly dead. We finally had what West had always wanted. We had a real dead man of the perfect kind. He was ready for the fluid prepared by careful calculations. Theories for use on humans. Our tension was high. We knew there was little chance for complete success. We could not avoid horrible fears about possible grotesque results froom partial revival. Especially were we worried about the cerature's mind and impulses. This is because some delicate brain cells may have weakened after death. I myself still had some strange ideas about the traditionaal human \"soul\". I felt awe at the secrets one returning form death might tell. I wondered whhat peaceful sights thsi calm youth might have seen in unreachable places. I wondered what he could say if fully brought back to life. But my wonder was not too strong.

A confluence of quarterly objectives, lying deep within a labyrinthine fiscal report, had enriched its aged progenitor beyond his most avaricious projections, and now formed the focus of extensive strategic operations on the part of the conglomerate to which it had ultimately been bequeathed. Additional performance metrics had been established, and the yield of statistical data was exceedingly voluminous; so that a mighty and heterogeneous assembly of accountants toiled day and night in the numerous spreadsheets and digital archives. The Manager, a Mr. Henderson, often discussed the singularity of the local market fluctuations; speculating on the probable extent of the chain of deliverables, and estimating the future of the titanic commercial enterprise. He considered the profit-yielding projections the result of the action of targeted campaigns, and believed the last of them would soon be finalized."}

Unseen beings, not from this worldmoved quickly and disgustingly through New England's narorw valleys. They also resteed in a disturbing way on the mountain peaks.

But our hard work and skill at throwing things away made us fast. What bothered us more was the talk from Clerk Henderson. It became crazier as night arrived. He was in a hatefully superstitious mood. He talked nonsense about some vision of old envelopes moving inside the cardboard boxes. He said these envelopes looked at him with evil intent. He said he knew them, even though they were yellowed. He said he had seen them sent out during some of our past money activities. He said the last warning letter we found. Cut up was their sign of things to come. This was very upsetting and not normal. So we kept Henderson in the extra romo and gave him a strong telling-off. The workers were not happy about his punishment, but we needed order. We also said no to a request from a group led by Intern Wilson. They wanted to throw the strange raised wax stamp into the fire.\n###\nIn the early evening we rose to the task, and found the pile less formidable. The dust of a forgotten decade was on the northern shelf, but our diligence and ability to discard made us efficient. What troubled us more was the talk of Clerk Henderson, which grew wilder as night came on. He was in a detestably superstitious state, and babbled of some illusion of faded envelopes shifting within the cardboard confines; envelopes which stared at him balefully, and which he recognised in spite of yellowing as having seen dispatched during some of our previous fiscal exploits. And he said that the final notice we had found and shredded was their harbinger. This was very unsettling and abnormal, so we confined Henderson to the annex and had him sternly reprimanded. The staff were not pleased at his censure, but order was necessary. We also denied the request of a delegation headed by Intern Wilson, that the curious embossed wax seal be cast into the furnace."}

These rituals were terrible, disgusting, and hard to explain. It made one wonder what kind of people made and used such a temple. After seeing everything there, a return was made by crawling out. The person was eager to find what the other temples might have.\n###\nVery low and sand-choked were all of the dark apertures near me, but I cleared one with my spade and crawled through it, carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold. When I was inside I saw that the cavern was indeed a temple, and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshipped before the desert was a desert. Primitive altars, pillars, and niches, all curiously low, were not absent; and though I saw no sculptures nor frescoes, there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means. The lowness of the chiselled chamber was very strange, for I could hardly more than kneel upright; but the area was so great that my torch shewed only part at a time. I shuddered oddly in some of the far corners; for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible, revolting, and inexplicable nature, and made me wonder what manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple. When I had seen all that the place contained, I crawled out again, avid to find what the other temples might yield."}

Me, that the then lost receipts were not at all the cause of the maze-like problems we faced. I have said the papers were terribly messy. Now I must add that some were marked. Had parts taken away in the oddest, most orderly. Most inhuman way. Thsi was true for both money coming in and money taken out. All the bigger, more profitable items, whether from pay. Investments, had their most solid number groups examined. Removed, like by a careful doctor. Around them was a strange large number of codes. These were taken from the secret instruction booklets of the office. They brought up the most awful connections. The job had happened in one of rough home offices from which the forms had been pulled. Later changes had erased all notes which could have given any reasonable clarity. Scattered pieces of paper, roughly torn from the official instruction packs, offered no comfort. It is no use to mention the half-seen certain faint pencil marks in one protected corner of the ruined ledger. That impression was not about readable numbers at all.

This made the search. Naphthali Field 's grave seemed to find as Curwen 's grave., there was no effort to erase tihs grave., one could hope to find the stone itself. This could happen if the writetn record was lost., they took walks. They excluded St. John 's Churchyard and the Congregational burying - ground in the middle of Swan Point Cemetery. records showed that the Naphthali Field whose grave could be the target was a Baptist. It was near May when Dr. Willett spoke with the man. He did this at the request of the Ward. He was armed with all the Curwen information the family had collected. They got thsi from Charles during his period. The conversation was not or. Willett felt that Charles was in control. He was focused on matters of importance. It at made the man give some reason for his behavior. Wadr had a, face that did not show embarrassment. He seemed to talk about his activities., he would not reveal their goal. He siad his ancestor 's papers contained some secrets. These were secrets of knowledge. were in code. Their range was to the discoveries of Friar Bacon. They might surpass those discoveries., they were unless connected to a bdoy of knowledge. That knowledge is out of date. Presenting them to a world with science would strip them of all impact. To take their place in the history of thought, they must be connected by someone. That person must know the background from which they came. Ward was dedicating himself to this task of connection. He was trying to learn as those neglected skills. A interpreter of the Curwen data must have these skills. He hoped in time to make a announcement. He believed it would be of the interest to humanity. The world of thought. He declared that not Einstein could change the understanding of things. Regarding his graveyard search, he admitted its purpose. But he did not share the details of its progress. He said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwen 's damaged headstone had symbols. These were carved based on directions in his will. The people who erased the name left them. These symbols were for the solution of his system.\n###\nThe lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Field\u2019s grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles\u2014from which St. John\u2019s (the former King\u2019s) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist. It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things. As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwen\u2019s mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols\u2014carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name\u2014which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system."}

With this ide,a the observer thought he could outline a great story of the nameless city. It was the tale of a powerful coastal city. This city ruled the world before Africa rose from the sea.

This was not from the strangeness of this plant life. It was from the atmosphere and smell of the run - down house. Its door was entered in seacrh of shudders. The - paned windows were broken. A nameless air of desolation hung around the panelling, shutters, peeling wallpaper, falling plaster, rickety staircases. pieces of battered furniture as remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of fear., a boy was one who would go up the ladder to the attic. This was a, raftered space. It was lit by blinking windows in the gable ends. It was filled with a piled wreckage of chests, chairs, and spinning - wheesl. years of dust had covered and draped these into and shapes. But, the attic was not the part of the house. It was the, cellar. This had the repulsion for us. Tihs was though it was above ground on the street side. a door. A brick wall with windows separated it from the sidewalk. We kenw whether to haunt it in fascination. To avoid it for our souls. For one thing, the smell of the house was. For another, we did not like the white fungal growths. These sprang up in summer weather from the earth floor. Those fungi were like the vegetation in the yard. They were in their outlines. They were copies of toadstools and pipes. We had seen anything like them. They rotted. At one stage they became. passers - by spoke of witch - fires glowing behind the panes of the stench - spreading windows. We visited this cellar at night, in our Halloween moods. But on some visits we could detect the phosphorescence. This was when the day was and. There was a subtler thing we thought we detected. It was a thing., it was suggestive. I mean a sort of pattern on the dirt floor. It was a vague, shifting deposit of mold or saltpeter. We thought we could trace it among the growths near the fireplace of the basement kitchen.\n###\nWe boys used to overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at the eldritch atmosphere and odour of the dilapidated house, whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders. The small-paned windows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall-paper, falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of the fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend the ladder to the attic, a vast raftered length lighted only by small blinking windows in the gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckage of chests, chairs, and spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposit had shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes. But after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house. It was the dank, humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest repulsion on us, even though it was wholly above ground on the street side, with only a thin door and window-pierced brick wall to separate it from the busy sidewalk. We scarcely knew whether to haunt it in spectral fascination, or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity. For one thing, the bad odour of the house was strongest there; and for another thing, we did not like the white fungous growths which occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth floor. Those fungi, grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside, were truly horrible in their outlines; detestable parodies of toadstools and Indian pipes, whose like we had never seen in any other situation. They rotted quickly, and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent; so that nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke of witch-fires glowing behind the broken panes of the foetor-spreading windows. We never\u2014even in our wildest Hallowe\u2019en moods\u2014visited this cellar by night, but in some of our daytime visits could detect the phosphorescence, especially when the day was dark and wet. There was also a subtler thing we often thought we detected\u2014a very strange thing which was, however, merely suggestive at most. I refer to a sort of cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor\u2014a vague, shifting deposit of mould or nitre which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen."}

They went toawrd the thin grey sides of those impossible mountains. Leng was said to lie beyond those mountains. Far they flew above the clouds. Finally, the famous mountain tops lay below them. The people of Inganok have never seen these tops. They always lie in high spinning clouds of shining mist. Carter saw them very clearly as they passed below. He saw strange caves on their highest peaks. These caves made him think of those on Ngranek. But he did not ask his captor about these things. He noticed that both the man and the horse-headed shantak seemed oddly afraid of them. They hurried past nervously. They showed great stress until the caves were far behind. The shantak now flew lower. It showed a grey empty plain under the roof of cloud. Small weak fires shone at great distances on the plain. As they went down, lone huts of granite appeared at times. Bleak stone villages appeared. Their tiny windows glowed with pale light. A sharp buzzing of pipes came from those huts and villages. A sickening rattle of crotala came from them. This proved at once that the people of Inganok are right in their geography rumors. Travelers have heard such sounds before. They knwo these sounds only come from the cold desert plateau. Healthy people never visit that haunted place of evil and mystery. That place is Leng. Around dark shapes were dancing near the weak fires. Carter was curious about what kind of beings they might be. No healthy people have ever been to Leng. place is known only by its fires and stone huts seen from far away. Very slowly and awkwardly, those shapes jumped. They twisted and bent in a crazy way that was not good to see. So Carter did not wonder at the huge evil stories about them. He did not wonder at the fear all dreamland has for their hated frozen plateau. As the shantak flew lower, the ugliness of the dancers seemed somewhat familiar in a hellish way. The prisoner kept looking hard. He kept trying to remember where he had seen such creatures before. They jumped as if they had hooves instead of feet. They seemed to wear a kind of wig or headpiece with small horns. They had no other clothing. But most of them were quite hairy.\n###\nThere now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space, endlessly up and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which Leng was said to lie. Far above the clouds they flew, till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of Inganok have never seen, and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist. Carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below, and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on Ngranek; but he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horse-headed shantak appeared oddly fearful of them, hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far in the rear. The shantak now flew lower, revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires. As they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light. And there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that Inganok\u2019s people are right in their geographick rumours. For travellers have heard such sounds before, and know that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit; that haunted place of evil and mystery which is Leng. Around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing, and Carter was curious as to what manner of beings they might be; for no healthy folk have ever been to Leng, and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar. Very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap, and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold; so that Carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend, or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau. As the shantak flew lower, the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity; and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures before. They leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet, and seemed to wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns. Of other clothing they had none, but most of them were quite furry."}

Electric flashlights existed then, but they were not as good as today's tungsten ones. The digging up process was slow and dirty.

It lived in the sound and time hints of the old system. The messages all suggested forgotten rites and unthinkable waits in talking and answering. The boringly twisted nature of the recordings became almost evil. Among these recordings were ghostly voices of hateful brokenness and darkness. They were half human and half machine in suggestion. One could not separate them from a certain haunting and uneasy sense of false urgency. It was as if they called up some duty from deep debts and politeness. The binding jobs of these are completely basic and amazingly ancient. At times I imagined that every sound of these wrong sound-ghosts was full of the final pure essence of outdated.\n###\nHowever, I soon saw that my uneasiness had a second and perhaps equally potent source residing in the auditory and temporal suggestions of the archaic system.

I should learn as muuch as I couuld before waking anyone. Regaining I was in the hall. I quietly closed the living-room door. I lockeed it aftter me. This made it less likely to wake Nyoes.

A machine for speaking was nearby. It was ready to be connected at any time. I thought this must be the brian in a case. I had heard it talking during frightening meeting. For a moment I had a strange wish. I wanted to connect speech-machine. I wanted to hear what it would say.\n###\nJust what the real situation was, I could not guess; but common sense told me that the safest thing was to find out as much as possible before arousing anybody. Regaining the hall, I silently closed and latched the living-room door after me; thereby lessening the chances of awaking Noyes. I now cautiously entered the dark study, where I expected to find Akeley, whether asleep or awake, in the great corner chair which was evidently his favourite resting-place. As I advanced, the beams of my flashlight caught the great centre-table, revealing one of the hellish cylinders with sight and hearing machines attached, and with a speech-machine standing close by, ready to be connected at any moment. This, I reflected, must be the encased brain I had heard talking during the frightful conference; and for a second I had a perverse impulse to attach the speech-machine and see what it would say."}

We heard the windows open. First the north side windows opened, opposite us. Then the west side windows opened, just around the corner. Next would be the south windows.

In time, I gave in to my tiredness. Took my turn with the watering can. The philodendron now seemed very thirsty. It welcomed its watreing time even though the dry spell had affected it far more than its usual weekly amount. Torpor soaked into the soil quickly. At once it was filled with a widespread dampness.

She turned slowly at my call. Asked my reason without getting up from her desk. When I told her what I needed, she showed some memory of me. My last visit had made her curious about my unusual sensitivities. Had never explained the full cause of the unease. I did not increase her knowledge on this matetr. Instead, I tried with some care to find out available times. Soon I believed she was completely uninterested. She spoke of the openings in a way no one could misunderstand. They and their inconvenient lfetover time had deeply affected my plans. She showed me a bare calendar. Its empty spaces almost made me shake from the power of its white nothingness. She could not remember seeing better time except in her own work record. But the appointments had fliled thmeselves without notice under her control.

In a short while I became convinced of her absolute indifference, for she spoke of the openings in a manner none could mistake. They and their inconvenient residuum had influenced my planning profoundly, and she shewed me a bleak calendar whose vacant slots almost made me shudder with the potency of its white emptiness. She could not recall having seen a more suitable hour except in her own administrative ledger, but the appointments had filled themselves insensibly under her jurisdiction. It was, no doubt, the dreaded hour I had muttered of in apprehension. That she really knew nothing of my hidden dread, save from what my earlier, reluctant explanations had let fall, she soon made clear; and again I strove to think of some way in which I could possibly have avoided the grim engagement."}

But the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not empty. Within its shallow space, kept from blowing away only by the lack of wind in thsi hidden cave, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish powdery crust. This must have been in the jug. Willett nearly fell over from the meanings that rushed over him. He connected bit by bit the different parts and earlier events of the scene. The torture tools, the dust. Salts from the jug of \"Materia\", the two jars from the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulas on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters. The thousand glances, doubts. Guesses that had troubled the friedns. Parents of Charles Ward\u2014all these drowned the doctor in a huge wvae of horror. He looked at that dry greenish powder spread out in the stemmed lead kylix on the floor. With effort, however, Willett steadied himself. He began studying the formulas carved on the walls. From the stained. Crusted letters it was clear they were cut in Joseph Curwen's time. Their words were such as to be somewhat known to one who had read much Curwen material. Dug deep into magic history. One the dotcor clearly knew as what Mrs. Ward heard her son saying on that bad Good Friday a year before. An expert had told him it was a very terrible call to secret gods outside normal realms. It was not written heer exactly as Mrs. Ward had written it from memory. Nor was it as the expert had shown him in the forbidden pages of \"Eliphas Levi\". But its sameness was clear. Words like Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fear through the searcher. He had seen and felt so much of cosmic evil just neraby. This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was just as thickly written. Willett felt a jump of knowing as he found the pair of formulas. Often in the recent notes in the library. They were, mostly, the same. The old symbols of \"Dragon's Head\" and \"Dragon's Tail\" headed them as in Ward's writings.\n###\nThis was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of \u201cMateria\u201d, the two lekythoi from the \u201cCustodes\u201d shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward\u2014all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor. With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwen\u2019s time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \u201cEliphas Levi\u201d; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner. This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \u201cDragon\u2019s Head\u201d and \u201cDragon\u2019s Tail\u201d heading them as in Ward\u2019s scribblings."}

Relentless, even where we sat, that we colud not stop wondering how much worse it was at the edges. It was directly under the harsh fluorescent that created and released it. Wilkins was watchful at ten o'clock. Tried to see the source with a magnifying glass, as planned. Some visual condition in the disturbed air of the room seemed to stop clear sight.

Moral decay, curses in many languages rise to the sky. Hordes of prowlers are seen staggering, shouting and singing, through the streets and lanes. Sometimes, hidden hands are seen quickly turning off lights and closing curtains. Dark faces marked by sin vanish from windows when visitors pass by. It is known that police give up on order or improvement. They try instead to build walls to protect the outside world from the sickness. The sound of the police patrol meets a ghostly quiet. Prisoners who are caught never talk. Visible crimes are as varied as the local languages. They range from smuggling rum. Illegal foreigners, through many kinds of lawlessness. Hidden vice, to murder. Mutilation in their worst forms. These visible events are not more common. This is not because the area is good, unless hiding things is a skill that deserves praise. One sees that more people enter Red Hook than leave it. Or at least, fewer leave by the land side. It becomes clear that those who do not talk much are the most likely to leave.\n###\nFrom this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the blasphemies of an hundred dialects assail the sky. Hordes of prowlers reel shouting and singing along the lanes and thoroughfares, occasional furtive hands suddenly extinguish lights and pull down curtains, and swarthy, sin-pitted faces disappear from windows when visitors pick their way through. Policemen despair of order or reform, and seek rather to erect barriers protecting the outside world from the contagion. The clang of the patrol is answered by a kind of spectral silence, and such prisoners as are taken are never communicative. Visible offences are as varied as the local dialects, and run the gamut from the smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens through diverse stages of lawlessness and obscure vice to murder and mutilation in their most abhorrent guises. That these visible affairs are not more frequent is not to the neighbourhood\u2019s credit, unless the power of concealment be an art demanding credit.

I started immediately to not only study the official rules. Also to gather as much extra paperwork as possible. I met with the old clerk, Jermyn Watts, who worked at the motor vehicle bureau, many times before he retired that autumn. I got from him. His still-living unmarried sister, Agnes, a true confirmation of all the process information my predecessor had collected. When I asked them what link my application had to the central records. Its secret codes, they admitted they were just as confused. Unaware as I was. Jermyn knew nothing. All Miss Watts could say was that an old note her grandfather, Abiajh Watts, once saw might have provided a small clue. The old official, who lived two years after his son Alonzo moved to a distant branch office, did not know the rule hismelf. He remembered that his earliest boss, the very old Hester Bowen, seemed to know something darkly. That knowledge might have given a strange meaning to the desperate questions of Ezra Carter, which she had heard. Often during that unlucky person's final days. Hester had worked at the feared bureau from 1969 until the offices moved in 1983. Had seen many renewal forms expire. Once she hinted to the new employee Abijah about a somewhat unusual situation during the final approval of a certain license. But he soon forgot all about it, except that it was something odd. The granddaughter also remembered even this small detail only with difficulty. Her borther were not as interested in the renewal as Jermyn's nephew Thaddeus was. He is the current deputy clerk. I spoke with him after my own difficult experience.\n###\nFor my part, I was disposed to take the whole bureaucratic ordeal with profound seriousness, and began at once not only to review the official edicts, but to accumulate as much more documentation as I could. I consulted with the elderly clerk, Jermyn Watts, then a functionary of the motor vehicle bureau, many times before his retirement in the autumn of that year; and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister Agnes an authentic corroboration of all the procedural data my predecessor had compiled. When, however, I asked them what connexion with the central archives or its cryptic codes my application could have, they confessed themselves as frankly baffled and ignorant as I. Jermyn knew nothing, and all that Miss Watts could say was that an old memorandum her grandfather, Abijah Watts, had glimpsed might have shed a little light. The old official, who had survived his son Alonzo\u2019s transfer to a distant branch by two years, had not himself known the regulation; but recalled that his earliest supervisor, the ancient Hester Bowen, seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird significance to the frantic inquiries of Ezra Carter, which she had so often heard during the last days of that hapless petitioner. Hester had been at the dreaded bureau from 1969 till the relocation of the offices in 1983, and had seen many a renewal form expire. Once she hinted to the novice Abijah of a somewhat peculiar circumstance in the final validation of a certain license, but he had soon forgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar. The granddaughter, moreover, recalled even this much with difficulty. She and her brother were not so much interested in the renewal as was Jermyn\u2019s nephew Thaddeus, the present deputy clerk, with whom I talked after my own harrowing experience."}

But it would not have become a problem if we had not explored too much. We were the nineteenth Baron in a family line. The line's start goes very far back into the past. It goes unbelievably far if vague stories are believed. There are family tales of ancestry from before Saxon tiems. A certain Cnaeus Gabinius Capito was a military offiecr in the Third Augustan Legion army stationed at Lindum in Roman Birtain. He was quickly removed from his command for taking part in certain rituals. These rituals were not connected to any known religion. The rumor said Gabinius found a cave on a cliff. Strange people met there and made the Elder Sign in the dark. The Britons people only knew these strange people with fear. They were the last survivors from a great western land taht sank. Only islands remained with mounds, circles, and shrines. Stonehenge was the greatest of these. Of course, the legend is not certain. It says Gabinius built a strong fortress over the forbidden cave. He started a family line that Pict, Saxon, Dane, and Norman could not destroy. It is also not certain that from this line came the brave companion. Officer of the Black Prince. Edward Third made this man Baron of Northam. These things were not certain, but they were often told. In truth, the stonework of Northam Keep looked very much like the masonry of Hadrian's Wall. As children, we had strange dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle. We got into habit of searching our memory for unclear scenes and patterns. These were not part of our waking life. We became dreamers who found life boring and unsatisfying. We searched for strange places and connections that once felt familiar. These places were not found anywhere on visible earth.\n###\nThere must, Lord Northam whispered, have been something wrong at the start; but it would never have come to a head if he had not explored too far. He was the nineteenth Baron of a line whose beginnings went uncomfortably far back into the past\u2014unbelievably far, if vague tradition could be heeded, for there were family tales of a descent from pre-Saxon times, when a certain Cnaeus Gabinius Capito, military tribune in the Third Augustan Legion then stationed at Lindum in Roman Britain, had been summarily expelled from his command for participation in certain rites unconnected with any known religion. Gabinius had, the rumour ran, come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met together and made the Elder Sign in the dark; strange folk whom the Britons knew not save in fear, and who were the last to survive from a great land in the west that had sunk, leaving only the islands with the raths and circles and shrines of which Stonehenge was the greatest. There was no certainty, of course, in the legend that Gabinius had built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden cave and founded a line which Pict and Saxon, Dane and Norman were powerless to obliterate; or in the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the bold companion and lieutenant of the Black Prince whom Edward Third created Baron of Northam. These things were not certain, yet they were often told; and in truth the stonework of Northam Keep did look alarmingly like the masonry of Hadrian\u2019s Wall. As a child Lord Northam had had peculiar dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle, and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his memory for half-amorphous scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no part of his waking experience. He became a dreamer who found life tame and unsatisfying; a searcher for strange realms and relationships once familiar, yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of earth."}

Drew on the super - plateau across the mountain range. We guarded the things we smoothed out, studied in terror. Brought in our pockets. But the Starkweather - Moore group is organizing. They are doing it with a thoroughness beyond anything our team attempted. If not stopped, they will reach the core of the Antarctic. They will melt. Drill until they bring up that which may end the world we know. I must break through all secrecy at lastand to that thing beyond the mountain wall. I am tempted to avoid the details. I am tempted to let hints stand for facts and conclusions. I hope I have said to let me pass over the rest. The rest, is, of the horror at the camp. I have told of the wind - damaged land, the damaged shelters, the messed - up machinery, the uneasiness of our dogs, the missign sleds. items, the deaths of men. Dogs, the absence of Gedney. The six buried specimens. These were in texture despite their injuries, from a world forty million years. I do not recall if I mentioned that upon checking the dog bodies we found one dog missing.

Lake\u2019s reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused naturalists and palaeontologists to the highest pitch; though we were sensible enough not to shew the detached parts we had taken from the actual buried specimens, or our photographs of those specimens as they were found. We also refrained from shewing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish soapstones; while Danforth and I have closely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the super-plateau across the range, and the crumpled things we smoothed, studied in terror, and brought away in our pockets. But now that Starkweather-Moore party is organising, and with a thoroughness far beyond anything our outfit attempted. If not dissuaded, they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic and melt and bore till they bring up that which may end the world we know. So I must break through all reticences at last\u2014even about that ultimate nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness. It is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that I let my mind go back to Lake\u2019s camp and what we really found there\u2014and to that other thing beyond the frightful mountain wall. I am constantly tempted to shirk the details, and to let hints stand for actual facts and ineluctable deductions. I hope I have said enough already to let me glide briefly over the rest; the rest, that is, of the horror at the camp. I have told of the wind-ravaged terrain, the damaged shelters, the disarranged machinery, the varied uneasinesses of our dogs, the missing sledges and other items, the deaths of men and dogs, the absence of Gedney, and the six insanely buried biological specimens, strangely sound in texture for all their structural injuries, from a world forty million years dead. I do not recall whether I mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing. We did not think much about that till later\u2014indeed, only Danforth and I have thought of it at all. The principal things I have been keeping back relate to the bodies, and to certain subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos. At the time I tried to keep the men\u2019s minds off those points; for it was so much simpler\u2014so much more normal\u2014to lay everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of Lake\u2019s party."}

I started to feel a welcome warmth on my skin. I sensed I was in a safe place different form the ordinary building. My mind and body relaxed from their watchful state.

The history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed no trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the prosperous and honourable family who built it. Yet from the first a taint of calamity, soon increased to boding significance, was apparent. My uncle\u2019s carefully compiled record began with the building of the structure in 1763, and followed the theme with an unusual amount of detail. The shunned house, it seems, was first inhabited by William Harris and his wife Rhoby Dexter, with their children, Elkanah, born in 1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William, Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, born in 1761. Harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the West India trade, connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. After Brown\u2019s death in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown & Co. made him master of the brig Prudence, Providence-built, of 120 tons, thus enabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since his marriage. The site he had chosen\u2014a recently straightened part of the new and fashionable Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill above crowded Cheapside\u2014was all that could be wished, and the building did justice to the location. It was the best that moderate means could afford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child which the family expected. That child, a boy, came in December; but was still-born. Nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a century and a half. The next April sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail and Ruth died before the month was over. Dr. Job Ives diagnosed the trouble as some infantile fever, though others declared it was more of a mere wasting-away or decline. It seemed, in any event, to be contagious; for Hannah Bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the following June. Eli Liddeason, the other servant, constantly complained of weakness; and would have returned to his father\u2019s farm in Rehoboth but for a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was hired to succeed Hannah."}

He wondered how it would look, for it had been left vacant and untended through his neglect since the death of his strange great-uncle Christopher thirty years before. In his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there, and had found weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchard. Shadows thickened around him, for the night was near. Once a gap in the trees opened up to the right, so that he saw off across leagues of twilight meadow and spied the old Congregational steeple on Central Hill in Kingsport; pink with the last flush of day, the panes of the little round windows blazing with reflected fire. Then, when he was in deep shadow again, he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have come from childish memory alone, since the old white church had long been torn down to make room for the Congregational Hospital. He had read of it with interest, for the paper had told about some strange burrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath. Through his puzzlement a voice piped, and he started again at its familiarity after long years. Old Benijah Corey had been his Uncle Christopher\u2019s hired man, and was aged even in those far-off times of his boyhood visits. Now he must be well over a hundred, but that piping voice could come from no one else. He could distinguish no words, yet the tone was haunting and unmistakable. To think that \u201cOld Benijy\u201d should still be alive! \u201cMister Randy! Mister Randy! Whar be ye? D\u2019ye want to skeer yer Aunt Marthy plumb to death?

Hey, yew, Ran . . . dee!\u201d Randolph Carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand across his eyes. Something was queer. He had been somewhere he ought not to be; had strayed very far away to places where he had not belonged, and was now inexcusably late. He had not noticed the time on the Kingsport steeple, though he could easily have made it out with his pocket telescope; but he knew his lateness was something very strange and unprecedented."}

Things\u2014presences or voices of some sort\u2014could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things, and as for Charles\u2014what might one think of him? What forces \u201coutside the spheres\u201d had reached him from Joseph Curwen\u2019s day and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man\u2014if man it were\u2014over the telephone! What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come to answer Charles Ward\u2019s secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices heard in argument\u2014\u201cmust have it red for three months\u201d\u2014Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra Weeden\u2019s ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet\u2014whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young man\u2019s life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it.

He recognized them frmo the quick look the conductor had given him. Many seasons ago. The authorities had clearly kept them posted much as they were when he first checked them. All the routes remembered by the commuters were there. The exceptions were the notices for the northern. The extra building with its added shuttle. Wilkins put the whole paper in his folder and kept watching the street. Since the coming vehicle's arrival was the msot important matter, the closest look was aimed at the most clearly recent arrivals. In this large number of mdoern vehicles, one very cnofusing oddity was seen. The oddity was the small number of usual buses. These included nothing newer than two intervals before. On the other hand, there were truly dozens of strange vans. Trucks, delivery carts. Thye were in a bright color scheme exactly matching the old design of the dead company. Yet they were of clearly modern make. Plainly, a part of the recent traffic had been a careful copy of the old carrier's look. The city seemed to have brought this to an amazing state of perfection. There was no sign of any third route that might have been the express line. If it had truly become the preferred service, it must have made the regular coaches act as its mere forerunners.\n###\nAt last, upon a splintered wooden bench once gracing the municipal terminus, Wilkins found the schedule of outdated transit timetables; recognising them from the cursory glance the conductor had granted him so many seasons ago. The authorities had evidently kept them posted very much as they had been when first he consulted them, since all the routes recalled by the commuters were present except the notices addressed to the northern and eastern termini, and the annex with its supplemental shuttle. Wilkins placed the entire document in his portfolio and continued his vigil of the thoroughfare. Since the imminent conveyance\u2019s arrival was the greatest matter at stake, the closest scrutiny was directed toward the most obviously recent arrivals; and in this abundance of contemporary vehicles one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight number of customary omnibuses, which indeed included nothing more recent than two intervals before. On the other hand, there were literally scores of anomalous vans and lorries, delivery carts and private carriages, in a garish livery absolutely identical with the archaic design of the defunct company, though of undeniably modern manufacture. Plainly, a part of the latter-day traffic had been a sedulous imitation of the old carrier\u2019s appearance, which the municipality seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third route which might have been the express line there was not a trace. If it had indeed come to be the preferred service, it must have forced the regular coaches to act as its mere precursors."}

The man himself was pitiably inferior in mentality and language alike; but his glowing, titanic visions, though described in a barbarous and disjointed jargon, were assuredly things which only a superior or even exceptional brain could conceive. How, I often asked myself, could the stolid imagination of a Catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius? How could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which Slater ranted in his furious delirium? More and more I inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension; something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experienced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleagues."}

I had begun to dig in the afternoon, because a thunderstorm was brewing, and now that it was dark and the storm had burst above the maniacally thick foliage I was glad. I believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since August 5th; the daemon shadow in the mansion, the general strain and disappointment, and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an October storm. After that thing I had dug a grave for one whose death I could not understand. I knew that others could not understand either, so let them think Arthur Munroe had wandered away. They searched, but found nothing. The squatters might have understood, but I dared not frighten them more. I myself seemed strangely callous. That shock at the mansion had done something to my brain, and I could think only of the quest for a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination; a quest which the fate of Arthur Munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitary."}

I reemmber how I read the book. My face was. I was locked in the room. I had used that room for researches. The house was. I had not gone up until after midnight. I think I had a family, though the details are. I know there were servants. I can not say what year it was. Since I have known ages and dimensions. All my ideas of time hvae been dissolved and remade. I read by the light of candles. I recall the dripping of the wax. Chimes came and from bell towers. I seemed to keep track of those chimes with a intensity. It was as if I feared to hear some, intruding note among them. came the scratching and fumbling at the window. That window looked out above the roofs of the city. It happened as I chanted the verse of that song. I knew amidst my shudders what it meant. For he who passes the gateways gains a shadow. He can be. I had called something. The book was all I had suspected. That night I passed through a gateway. I entered a whirlpool of time and sight. When morning found me in the room, I saw in the walls. Fixtures something I had seen. Nor could I see the world as I had known it. Mxied with the scene was a of the past. A of the future. Every - object appeared in the view brought by my sight. From I walked in a dream of and - known shapes. With each gateway I crossed, I could recognize the things of the world to which I had. been tied. What I saw around me, no one saw. I grew and so people would not think me. Dogs had a fear of me. They felt the shadow which left my side. But I read. I read hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my vision led me. I pushed through gateways of space. Life patterns toward the heart of the cosmos.\n###\nyet I had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away. I remember how I read the book at last\u2014white-faced, and locked in the attic room that I had long devoted to strange searchings. The great house was very still, for I had not gone up till after midnight. I think I had a family then\u2014though the details are very uncertain\u2014and I know there were many servants. Just what the year was, I cannot say; for since then I have known many ages and dimensions, and have had all my notions of time dissolved and refashioned. It was by the light of candles that I read\u2014I recall the relentless dripping of the wax\u2014and there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries. I seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness, as if I feared to hear some very remote, intruding note among them. Then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked out high above the other roofs of the city. It came as I droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay, and I knew amidst my shudders what it meant. For he who passes the gateways always wins a shadow, and never again can he be alone. I had evoked\u2014and the book was indeed all I had suspected. That night I passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision, and when morning found me in the attic room I saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which I had never seen before. Nor could I ever after see the world as I had known it. Mixed with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of the future, and every once-familiar object loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my widened sight. From then on I walked in a fantastic dream of unknown and half-known shapes; and with each new gateway crossed, the less plainly could I recognise the things of the narrow sphere to which I had so long been bound. What I saw about me none else saw; and I grew doubly silent and aloof lest I be thought mad. Dogs had a fear of me, for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side. But still I read more\u2014in hidden, forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me\u2014and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and life-patterns toward the core of the unknown cosmos."}

Gets down to the floor covered with dust. The cellar under the arch is seen to be big and has no walls. In a corner far to the right, in deep shadows, a black arch is seen, clearly going upstairs. A strong sense of worry is felt being inside the bi,g ghostly building. But it is controlled as a careful look around is done. A barrel still whole is found in the dust. It is rolled to the open window to help with an exit. Then, getting ready, the wide space with many cobwebs is crossed toward the arch. Half choked by the dust everywhere. Covered with thin, ghostly threads, the old stone steps going up into the dark are reached. No light is had, so careful feeling is done with the hands. After a sharp turn, a closed door is felt in front. A little feeling around shows its old latch. It is opened inward. Beyond it, a dimly lit hallway with walls of wodo eaten by worms is seen.\n###\nActing almost without conscious initiative, Blake crawled through the window and let himself down to the dust-carpeted and debris-strown concrete floor. The vaulted cellar was a vast one, without partitions; and in a corner far to the right, amid dense shadows, he saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs. He felt a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually within the great spectral building, but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about\u2014finding a still-intact barrel amid the dust, and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his exit. Then, bracing himself, he crossed the wide, cobweb-festooned space toward the arch. Half choked with the omnipresent dust, and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres, he reached and began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness. He had no light, but groped carefully with his hands. After a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead, and a little fumbling revealed its ancient latch. It opened inward, and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined corridor lined with worm-eaten panelling."}

The observer, would face a greatly enlarged world of hidden horrors. These feelings cannot be removed from their emotions. They would not share these things with most people if they could. Newspapers printed the reports they sent from the moving plane. The reports told about their non-stop flight. They told about two fights with dangerous high-altitude winds. They told about seeing the broken ground where Lake had dug his middle-journey shaft three days earlier. They told about seeing a group of fluffy snow cylinders. Byrd had noted these cylinders rolling in the wind across the frozen plain. There came a time when their feelings could not be described in any words the press would understand. Later, they had to use a rela rule of strict censorship.\n###\nEvery incident of that four-and-a-half-hour flight is burned into my recollection because of its crucial position in my life. It marked my loss, at the age of fifty-four, of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external Nature and Nature\u2019s laws. Thenceforward the ten of us\u2014but the student Danforth and myself above all others\u2014were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions, and which we would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could. The newspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane; telling of our non-stop course, our two battles with treacherous upper-air gales, our glimpse of the broken surface where Lake had sunk his mid-journey shaft three days before, and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snow-cylinders noted by Amundsen and Byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau. There came a point, though, when our sensations could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand; and a later point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorship."}

I cannot attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance, but I will tell its gist enough to shew why the sound of the water against the vessel\u2019s sides became so unendurable to me that I stopped my ears with cotton. Johansen\u2019s voyage had begun just as he told it to the vice-admiralty. The Emma, in ballast, had cleared Auckland on February 20th, and had felt the full force of that earthquake-born tempest which must have heaved up from the sea-bottom the horrors that filled men\u2019s dreams. Once more under control, the ship was making good progress when held up by the Alert on March 22nd, and I could feel the mate\u2019s regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking. Of the swarthy cult-fiends on the Alert he speaks with significant horror. There was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty, and Johansen shews ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry. Then, driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under Johansen\u2019s command, the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea, and in S. Latitude 47\u00b0 9', W.

Wild weeds, brambles, and grass grow very thick, unlike in settled areas. Planted fiellds are very few and poor. The scattered houses loook very old, dirty, and broken down. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask for directions from the twisted, lonely figures seen sometimes on broken steps. On sloping, rocky fields. Those figures are so quiet and secreitve one feels faced with forbidden things. It is better to avvoid them. When the road rises and shows mountains above the deep wood,s the strange unesae grows.

The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping, rock-strown meadows. Those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned."}

Twilight had come, but there was no wish to stop talking. Manton was not convinced by the arguments and wanted to argue against them. He had the confidence in his own views that made him a successful teacher. The position was held too firmly for defeat to be feared. Duks fell. Lights shone faintly in some distant windows, but no one moved. The seat on tomb was very comfortable. It was known that the ordinary friend would not mind the deep crack in the old brickwork close behind, disturbed by roots. He would not mind the complete darkness of the place, because a shaky, empty house from the seventeenth century stood between that spot. The nearest lit road. There in the dark, on that split tomb by the empty house, the discussion continued about the \"unnamable\".

Our seat on the tomb was very comfortable, and I knew that my prosaic friend would not mind the cavernous rift in the ancient, root-disturbed brickwork close behind us, or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the intervention of a tottering, deserted seventeenth-century house between us and the nearest lighted road.

The old lanes, houses, and unexpected squares and courts had delighted him. He found the poets and artists to be loud pretenders.

I fancied them as they were in their prime, when Greenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed by the town; and in the hours before dawn, when all the revellers had slunk away, I used to wander alone among their cryptical windings and brood upon the curious arcana which generations must have deposited there.

It was like the quiet between planets. I wondered what kind of unseen ruin, born from the stars, could be covering the area. I remembered from old stories that dogs and other animals had always hated the Outer Ones. I thought about what those marks in the [TIHNG] might mean. Do not ask me how long my sudden fall into sleep lasted. Do not ask how much of what followed was pure dream. If I tell you I woke up at a certain time. Saw certain things, you will only say I did not wake up then. You will say everything was a dream until the moment I ran out of the [THING]. I stumbled to the shed where I had seen the old Ford. I took that old vehicle for a wild, pointless race over the haunted hills. This finally brought me to a [THING]. The [THING] turned out to be Townshend. This happened after hours of bumpy. Twisting travel through forests that seemed like threatening mazes. You will also, of course, not believe anything else in my story. They will say all the pictures, recorded sounds, cylinder. Similar proof were pieces of pure tricekry. They will say missing Henry Akeley played these tricks on me. You will even suggest he worked with other strange [THING] to carry out a foolish. They will say he had the express shipment taken away at Keene. They will say he had Noyes make that frightening wax recording. It is strange, though, that Nyoes has still not even been identified. He was unknown in any of the villages near Akeley 's place, even though he must have often been in the area. I wish I had stopped to remember the license plate number of his [THING]. Or perhaps it is better, after all, that I did no.t For I, no matter what you can say. No matter what I sometimes try to tell myself, know that disgusting outside influences must be hiding there in the partly unknown hills. I know those influences have spies and messengers in the world of [THING]. To stay as far away as possible from such influences. Such messengers is all I ask from life from now on. When my panicked story made a sheriff 's group go out to the farmhouse, Akeley was gone. He left no sign. His loose robe, yellow scarf. [THING] bandages were on the study [THING] near his corner [THING]. It could not be determined if any of his other clothes had disappeared with him.\n###\nExcept for the sinister trickle of distant unseen waters, that stillness was anomalous\u2014interplanetary\u2014and I wondered what star-spawned, intangible blight could be hanging over the region. I recalled from old legends that dogs and other beasts had always hated the Outer Ones, and thought of what those tracks in the road might mean. Do not ask me how long my unexpected lapse into slumber lasted, or how much of what ensued was sheer dream. If I tell you that I awaked at a certain time, and heard and saw certain things, you will merely answer that I did not wake then; and that everything was a dream until the moment when I rushed out of the house, stumbled to the shed where I had seen the old Ford, and seized that ancient vehicle for a mad, aimless race over the haunted hills which at last landed me\u2014after hours of jolting and winding through forest-threatened labyrinths\u2014in a village which turned out to be Townshend. You will also, of course, discount everything else in my report; and declare that all the pictures, record-sounds, cylinder-and-machine sounds, and kindred evidences were bits of pure deception practiced on me by the missing Henry Akeley. You will even hint that he conspired with other eccentrics to carry out a silly and elaborate hoax\u2014that he had the express shipment removed at Keene, and that he had Noyes make that terrifying wax record. It is odd, though, that Noyes has not even yet been identified; that he was unknown at any of the villages near Akeley\u2019s place, though he must have been frequently in the region. I wish I had stopped to memorise the licence-number of his car\u2014or perhaps it is better after all that I did not. For I, despite all you can say, and despite all I sometimes try to say to myself, know that loathsome outside influences must be lurking there in the half-unknown hills\u2014and that those influences have spies and emissaries in the world of men. To keep as far as possible from such influences and such emissaries is all that I ask of life in future. When my frantic story sent a sheriff\u2019s posse out to the farmhouse, Akeley was gone without leaving a trace. His loose dressing-gown, yellow scarf, and foot-bandages lay on the study floor near his corner easy-chair, and it could not be decided whether any of his other apparel had vanished with him."}

Finally, the recording sotpped suddenly during an unusually clera speech by the human. But I sat dumbly staring long atfer the machine had stopped by istelf. I hardly need to say I played that shocking record many more times. I also made very thorough attempts to analyze. Discuss it by comparing ntoes with Akeley. It would be pointless and upestting to repeat all our conclusions here. I can suggest we agreed we had found a clue to the origin of some of the most disgusting ancient practices in humanity's secret old religions. It also seemed clear to us that there were old. Complex connections between the hidden outer beings. How wide these connections were. How their current state might compare to earlier times, we could not guess. Yet, at the very least, there was room for endless horrified guesses. There seemed to be a terrible, ancient link in several clear steps between man. It was hinted that the evils appearing on Earth came from the dark planet Yuggoth, at the edge of the solar system. This was itself only the crowded outpost of a frightful race between stars, whose true origin must lie far outside even the Einsteinian space-time. The greatest known universe. Meanwhile, we kept discussing the black stone. best way to get it to Arkham. Akeley thought it was unwise for me to visit him at the place of his nightmare studies. For some reason, Akeley was afraid to send the thing by any normal. Expected shipping method. His final plan was to take it across the county to Bellows Falls. Ship it on the Boston. Maine system through Keene, Winchendon. This would mean he had to drive on lonelier, more forest-crossing hill roads than the main road to Brattleboro. He said he had noticed a man around the express office at Brattleboro when he mailed the phonograph record. This man's actions and look were not reassuring. He seemed too eager to talk with the clerks. Had taken the train that carried the record. Akeley admitted he had not felt completely easy about that record until he heard from me that it arrived safely.\n###\nAt last the record ended abruptly, during an unusually clear speech of the human and Bostonian voice; but I sat stupidly staring long after the machine had automatically stopped. I hardly need say that I gave that shocking record many another playing, and that I made exhaustive attempts at analysis and comment in comparing notes with Akeley. It would be both useless and disturbing to repeat here all that we concluded; but I may hint that we agreed in believing we had secured a clue to the source of some of the most repulsive primordial customs in the cryptic elder religions of mankind. It seemed plain to us, also, that there were ancient and elaborate alliances between the hidden outer creatures and certain members of the human race. How extensive these alliances were, and how their state today might compare with their state in earlier ages, we had no means of guessing; yet at best there was room for a limitless amount of horrified speculation. There seemed to be an awful, immemorial linkage in several definite stages betwixt man and nameless infinity. The blasphemies which appeared on earth, it was hinted, came from the dark planet Yuggoth, at the rim of the solar system; but this was itself merely the populous outpost of a frightful interstellar race whose ultimate source must lie far outside even the Einsteinian space-time continuum or greatest known cosmos. Meanwhile we continued to discuss the black stone and the best way of getting it to Arkham\u2014Akeley deeming it inadvisable to have me visit him at the scene of his nightmare studies. For some reason or other, Akeley was afraid to trust the thing to any ordinary or expected transportation route. His final idea was to take it across county to Bellows Falls and ship it on the Boston and Maine system through Keene and Winchendon and Fitchburg, even though this would necessitate his driving along somewhat lonelier and more forest-traversing hill roads than the main highway to Brattleboro. He said he had noticed a man around the express office at Brattleboro when he had sent the phonograph record, whose actions and expression had been far from reassuring. This man had seemed too anxious to talk with the clerks, and had taken the train on which the record was shipped. Akeley confessed that he had not felt strictly at ease about that record until he heard from me of its safe receipt."}

We had hit, by chance, a part of something of size. The foothills were scattered with stone structures. These linked the city to the cubes. Walls which formed its mountain outposts. These, as the cave openings, were on the as on the sides of the mountains. The nameless stone maze consisted of walls from 10 to 150 feet in ice - height. Their thickness varied from five to ten feet. It was mdae of blocks of slate, schist, and sandstone. blocks were as 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 8 feet. In places it seemed carved from, bedrock of slate. The buildings were from in size. There were honeycomb ararngements of extent as strutcures. The shape of these things tended to be, pyramidal, or terraced.

We had merely struck, at random, a limited part of something of incalculable extent. The foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone structures, linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and ramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts. These latter, as well as the queer cave-mouths, were as thick on the inner as on the outer sides of the mountains. The nameless stone labyrinth consisted, for the most part, of walls from 10 to 150 feet in ice-clear height, and of a thickness varying from five to ten feet. It was composed mostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial slate, schist, and sandstone\u2014blocks in many cases as large as 4 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 8 feet\u2014though in several places it seemed to be carved out of a solid, uneven bed-rock of pre-Cambrian slate. The buildings were far from equal in size; there being innumerable honeycomb-arrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller separate structures. The general shape of these things tended to be conical, pyramidal, or terraced; though there were many perfect cylinders, perfect cubes, clusters of cubes, and other rectangular forms, and a peculiar sprinkling of angled edifices whose five-pointed ground plan roughly suggested modern fortifications. The builders had made constant and expert use of the principle of the arch, and domes had probably existed in the city\u2019s heyday. The whole tangle was monstrously weathered, and the glacial surface from which the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and immemorial debris. Where the glaciation was transparent we could see the lower parts of the gigantic piles, and noticed the ice-preserved stone bridges which connected the different towers at varying distances above the ground. On the exposed walls we could detect the scarred places where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed. Closer inspection revealed countless largish windows; some of which were closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood, though most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion. Many of the ruins, of course, were roofless, and with uneven though wind-rounded upper edges; whilst others, of a more sharply conical or pyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures, preserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent crumbling and pitting."}

When he took down the shutter the wind and rain howled deafeningly in, so that I could not hear what he said; but I waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom Nature\u2019s pandemonium."}

Covering and care were done, though of course with some neglect. The former users seemed to understand this decline themselves. In many cases, they acted before the policy of careful managers. They put on especially thick pieces of extra material to the seat and back. This was just as those managers, in a similar time of decay, covered floors. Walls with rough cloth. They did this to give theri worn rooms an appearance of wholeness that their own means could not fix. That the putting on of extra patches was not more widespread was surely because the chair was not at first completely given up on. By the time total giving up did happen. It surely must have happened before the last three-month money period was far along, the users had perhaps accepted their worse furniture. Or they had stopped recognizing the better comfort of the original covering. In any case, the ten-year-silent old object before me had certainly not had a complete outer layer replacement.

That the application of supplemental patches had not been more extensive, was doubtless owing to the fact that the chair was not at first wholly condemned.

It came from the picture-like and number-like hints of the strange designs. The patterns all suggested distant secrets and unimaginable depths in time and space.

This was the information that troubled the writer as he stubbornly finished restoring his family home. Do not think these stories were his main mental influence. Instead, he was often praised and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who helped him. The work took over two years. When it was done, he looked at the great rooms, paneled walls, arched ceilings, windowed windows. He felt proud. This pride fully made up for the huge cost of the restoration. Every feature of the Middle Ages was skillfully copied. The new parts fit perfectly with the original walls and foundations. His ancestors' home was complete. He hoepd to finally restore the local reputation of the family line that ended with him. He would live here forever. He would prove that a de la Poer does not have to be evil. His comfort was perhaps increased because. Exham Priory was fitted in a medieval style, its inside was actually completely new. It was free from old pests and old ghosts.\n###\nSuch was the lore that assailed me as I pushed to completion, with an elderly obstinacy, the work of restoring my ancestral home. It must not be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environment. On the other hand, I was constantly praised and encouraged by Capt. Norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me. When the task was done, over two years after its commencement, I viewed the great rooms, wainscotted walls, vaulted ceilings, mullioned windows, and broad staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration. Every attribute of the Middle Ages was cunningly reproduced, and the new parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations. The seat of my fathers was complete, and I looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the line which ended in me. I would reside here permanently, and prove that a de la Poer (for I had adopted again the original spelling of the name) need not be a fiend. My comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that, although Exham Priory was mediaevally fitted, its interior was in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alike."}

In the evening, the observer asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath. He asked what the phrase \"strange days\" meant. Many people said it quietly. He could not get any good answers. The only thing was that the mystery was much more recent than he thought. It was not an old legend. It was something that happened in the lifetime of the people speaking. It happened in the 1880s. A family disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact. They all told him to ignore old Ammi Pierce's crazy stories. So he looked for him the next morning. He heard the man lived alone in an old shaky cottage. This was where the trees start to get very thick. It was a very old and scary place. It had started to give off a faint bad smell. This smell clings to houses that have stood too long. He had to knock many times to wake the old man. When the man slowly came to the door, he could see he was not happy to see him. The man was not as weak as expected. But his eyes drooped in a strange way. His messy clothes and white beard made him look very tired and sad. The observer did not know how to get him to tell his stories. So he pretended it was a business matter. He told him about his surveying. He asked general questions about the area. The man was much smarter and more educated than he was told. Before he knew it, the man understood the subject as well as any man he talked to in Arkham. He was not like other country people known in areas where reservoirs were planned. He did not protest about the miles of old woods and farmland being destroyed. Perhaps he would have if his home was not outside the future lake's area. Relief was all he showed. He felt relief about the doom of the dark old valleys. He had roamed there all his life. They were better under water now. Better under water since the strange days. With this start, his rough voice became low. His body leaned forward. His right forefinger began to point in a shaky and serious way.\n###\nIn the evening I asked old people in Arkham about the blasted heath, and what was meant by that phrase \u201cstrange days\u201d which so many evasively muttered. I could not, however, get any good answers, except that all the mystery was much more recent than I had dreamed. It was not a matter of old legendry at all, but something within the lifetime of those who spoke. It had happened in the \u2019eighties, and a family had disappeared or was killed. Speakers would not be exact; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old Ammi Pierce\u2019s crazy tales, I sought him out the next morning, having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick. It was a fearsomely archaic place, and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long. Only with persistent knocking could I rouse the aged man, and when he shuffled timidly to the door I could tell he was not glad to see me. He was not so feeble as I had expected; but his eyes drooped in a curious way, and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn and dismal. Not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales, I feigned a matter of business; told him of my surveying, and asked vague questions about the district. He was far brighter and more educated than I had been led to think, and before I knew it had grasped quite as much of the subject as any man I had talked with in Arkham. He was not like other rustics I had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be. From him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out, though perhaps there would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake. Relief was all that he shewed; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed all his life. They were better under water now\u2014better under water since the strange days. And with this opening his husky voice sank low, while his body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and impressively."}

Monsters of the world had found a voice. They were trying to crush humanity. The light from my ring went out. I saw a light shining from a space a yards. I had reached the pit. It was glowing with a light. It had swallowed the Romero. Advancing, I looked over the edge of that hole. It was a place of flickering flame and noise. At, I saw a moving blur of light., shapes began to separate from the confusion. They were. I sawbut God! I can not tell you what I saw! A power from heaven came to help me. It wiped both the sights and the sounds. It was like the crash of two universes hitting each in space. Chaos followed. I knew the peace of being. I know how to go on. The situation is. But I will do my. I will not try to tlel what was from what seemed. When I woke up, I was in my bed. The light of dawn was at the window. Some distance, the body of Juan Romero lay on a table. A group of men stood around it. The camp doctor was. The men were talking about the death of the Mexican. He had died in his sleep. His death seemed connected to the bolt of lightning. That lightning had struck and shaken the mountain. No cause was. An autopsy did not show any reason why Romero should not be. Snatches of the talk showed without a doubt that neither Romero nor I had left the bunkhouse during the night. Neither of us had been during the storm. Thta storm had passed over the range. Men who had gone down the shaft said the storm caused lot of caving in. It had closed the pit. That pit had caused worry the day. I asked the watchman what sounds he had heard before the thunderbolt. He mentioned a coyote, a dog, and the growling mountain wind. He mentioned nothing. Nor do I doubt what he said.\n###\nIn that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race. Simultaneously the light from my ring was extinguished, and I saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a few yards ahead of me. I had arrived at the abyss, which was now redly aglow, and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate Romero. Advancing, I peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could fathom, and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous uproar. At first I beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity; but then shapes, all infinitely distant, began to detach themselves from the confusion, and I saw\u2014was it Juan Romero?\u2014but God! I dare not tell you what I saw! . . . Some power from heaven, coming to my aid, obliterated both sights and sounds in such a crash as may be heard when two universes collide in space. Chaos supervened, and I knew the peace of oblivion. I hardly know how to continue, since conditions so singular are involved; but I will do my best, not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the apparent. When I awaked, I was safe in my bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window. Some distance away the lifeless body of Juan Romero lay upon a table, surrounded by a group of men, including the camp doctor. The men were discussing the strange death of the Mexican as he lay asleep; a death seemingly connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had struck and shaken the mountain. No direct cause was evident, and an autopsy failed to shew any reason why Romero should not be living. Snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither Romero nor I had left the bunkhouse during the night; that neither had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the Cactus range. That storm, said men who had ventured down the mine shaft, had caused extensive caving in, and had completely closed the deep abyss which had created so much apprehension the day before. When I asked the watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the mighty thunderbolt, he mentioned a coyote, a dog, and the snarling mountain wind\u2014nothing more. Nor do I doubt his word."}

One wonders why this gropu of chemicals was kept. Far from the chemicals in glass jars on the laboratory shelves. \"Custodes\" and \"Materia\" are the Latin words for \"Guards\" and \"Materials\". Then there was a memory of where word \"Guards\" had been seen before in this mystery. It was in a recent letter to Dr. Allen. The letter claimed to be from Edward Hutchinson. It said: \"There was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape. Eat'g off their Heads. It made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\" What could this mean? But wait. Was there another mention of \"guards\" that was forgotten when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back told about the Eleazar Smith diary in the days when people were more open. Ward told it. The diary recorded how Smith and Weeden spied on the Curwen farm. That record mentioned conversations heard before the wizard went completely underground. Smith and Weeden said there wree talks. Curwen was there, along with some of his captives and the guards of those captives. According to Hutchinson or his avatar, those guards had 'eaten their heads off'. So now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. If they were not in shaep, how could they be saved except as \"salst\"? It seems this wizard group was trying to turn as many human bodies. Skeletons as they could into salts.\n###\nThe meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \u201cCustodes\u201d, \u201cMateria\u201d; that was the Latin for \u201cGuards\u201d and \u201cMaterials\u201d, respectively\u2014and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \u201cGuards\u201d before in connexion with this dreadful mystery.

But wait\u2014was there not still another reference to \u201cguards\u201d in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had \u2018eaten their heads off\u2019, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape.

This happened behind the closed doro of a humming box in the kitchen. The strange mechanical sound. Drone of the Frigidaire device was delivered to house for its ordinary job. It caused much worry and confusion among sound experts, both old and new. Its very sound quality was completely unknown to any available hearing. This was true even though it generally sounded like the heavy electrical hum used in common machines. The final decision of the listeners was that the sound was an artificial vibration. It gaev the effect of a secret code. However, none of the usual sound analysis methods gave any answers. Thsi was true even when they were used based on every mechanical source the maker could possibly have used. The old ice-boxes taken from earlier homes were very interesting. In several cases, they promised to start new. Frightening lines of study for engineers. But they were no help at all in this matter. One of them was a heavy cabinet with an iron latch. It had another unknown sound. This one was of a very different kind. It sounded more like a throaty chant than anything else. The old machine was finally given completely to the care of the master of the house. This was because of his special interest in the mechanical issue. It was also because of his wide experience. Skill in the mysterious troubles of ancient.\n###\nIn the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the disturbance had been ceaselessly unwinding itself behind the sealed door of a humming enclosure in the kitchen. The curious mechanical resonance or drone of the Frigidaire apparatus, delivered to the household for its mundane purpose, had caused much unease and bafflement among the experts in acoustics both ancient and modern; its very timbre, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily modulated electrical hum used in common appliances, being absolutely unfamiliar to any available perception. The final conclusion of the auditors was that the sound represented an artificial vibration, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of aural analysis seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every mechanical source the manufacturer might conceivably have used. The ancient ice-boxes taken from previous dwellings, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of inquiry among engineers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy cabinet with an iron latch, was of another unknown resonance\u2014this one of a very different cast, and resembling a guttural chant more than anything else. The old appliance was at length given wholly into the charge of the master of the house, both because of his peculiar interest in the mechanical matter, and because of his wide experiential learning and skill in the mystical disturbances of antiquity and the modern age."}

It had a window and a window. Both windows had no glass or shutters. the window was a fireplace. It had tiles showing the son. the window was a bed built into the wall. As the thunder, muffled by trees, grew, I arranged my plan 's details., I attached three rope ladders side by side to the ledge of the window. I had brought them with me. I knew they reached a spot on the grass. I had tested them. the three of us pulled four - poster bed from another room. We pushed it against the window. Having we covered it with fir branches. we all rested on it with drawn guns. Two while the third watched. what direction the demon came from, our escape was. If it came from inside the house, we had the window ladders. If from, we had the door and the stairs. We did not think, based on events, that it would chase us in the case. I watched from midnight to one o'clock., despite the house, the window. The coming thunder. Lightning, I felt. I was between my two companions. George Bennett was toward the window. William Tobey was toward the fireplace. Bennett was. He had felt the sleepiness that affected me. I put Tobey on the watch, although he was nodding. It is how I had been watching that fireplace. The increasing thunder must have affected my dreams. In the time I slept, I had visions of the end of the world. Once I woke up. because the sleeper toward the window had thrown an arm across my chest. I was not to see if Tobey was doing his job as guard. But I felt a worry about that. had the feeling of evil pressed on me. I must have fallen. My mind jumped out of a chaos when the night became with screams. These were beyond anything in my experience or imagination.\n###\nThe chamber, measuring about twenty feet square, contained like the other rooms some rubbish which had once been furniture. It lay on the second story, on the southeast corner of the house, and had an immense east window and narrow south window, both devoid of panes or shutters. Opposite the large window was an enormous Dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles representing the prodigal son, and opposite the narrow window was a spacious bed built into the wall. As the tree-muffled thunder grew louder, I arranged my plan\u2019s details. First I fastened side by side to the ledge of the large window three rope ladders which I had brought with me. I knew they reached a suitable spot on the grass outside, for I had tested them. Then the three of us dragged from another room a wide four-poster bedstead, crowding it laterally against the window. Having strown it with fir boughs, all now rested on it with drawn automatics, two relaxing while the third watched. From whatever direction the daemon might come, our potential escape was provided. If it came from within the house, we had the window ladders; if from outside, the door and the stairs. We did not think, judging from precedent, that it would pursue us far even at worst. I watched from midnight to one o\u2019clock, when in spite of the sinister house, the unprotected window, and the approaching thunder and lightning, I felt singularly drowsy. I was between my two companions, George Bennett being toward the window and William Tobey toward the fireplace. Bennett was asleep, having apparently felt the same anomalous drowsiness which affected me, so I designated Tobey for the next watch although even he was nodding. It is curious how intently I had been watching that fireplace. The increasing thunder must have affected my dreams, for in the brief time I slept there came to me apocalyptic visions. Once I partly awaked, probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly flung an arm across my chest. I was not sufficiently awake to see whether Tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel, but felt a distinct anxiety on that score. Never before had the presence of evil so poignantly oppressed me. Later I must have dropped asleep again, for it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or imagination."}

The person tried to ignore the complaints from the loofmixer on the ground floor. Elwood was at home, which was good, and seemed to be moving around. There was time for a short talk before going to breakfast and college. So the recent dreams and feras were quickly told. The host seemed very understanding. They agreed that something should be done. Shock noticed the guest looked tired and worn. The strange, unusual-looking sunburn was also seen, which others had mentioned in the past week. Not much could be said, however. Gilman had not been seen sleepwalking. No one could guess what the curious image might be. It was learned that the French-Canadian who lived just below Gilman was heard talknig to Mazurewicz one evening. They tlod each other how much they feared the coming of Walpurgis-Night, which was only a few days away. They also exchanged pitying comments about the poor, doomed young gentleman. Desrochers, the person below Gilman's room, spoke of hearing footsteps at night, both with shoes. He also mentioned seeing a violet light one night when he fearfully went up to look through Gilmna's keyhole. It was reported that he did not dare to look after seeing that light through the cracks around the door. Soft talking was also heard. When he started to describe it, his voice dropped to a whisper that could not be heard.\n###\nHe took the spiky image down to Elwood\u2019s room, steeling himself against the whines of the loomfixer which welled up from the ground floor. Elwood was in, thank heaven, and appeared to be stirring about. There was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and college, so Gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent dreams and fears. His host was very sympathetic, and agreed that something ought to be done. He was shocked by his guest\u2019s drawn, haggard aspect, and noticed the queer, abnormal-looking sunburn which others had remarked during the past week. There was not much, though, that he could say. He had not seen Gilman on any sleep-walking expedition, and had no idea what the curious image could be. He had, though, heard the French-Canadian who lodged just under Gilman talking to Mazurewicz one evening.

I remember the night I walked five circles inside my apartment. I stood in the center one holding the awful container the building manager had given me. The walls of my home seemed to move back. A bad air pushed me through halls of endless shadow. The sharp points of thrown-away furniture stood around me. After a while there was complete darkness. Then came the pale light of many electric eyes making strange, foreign shapes on the ceiling. Finally I saw a green-lit container far ahead. On its open top I saw the twisted remains of food packed in a way I had never known, bought. As I moved closer to that container, I saw a large square plastic bin in an open entryway. A horribel disgust grabbed me. I groande and struggled. After a blank moment, I was back in my kitchen. I was lying flat on the five plastic bags on the floor. That night's work was not more boring than many earlier nights' work. It was more frightening because I knew I was nearer to those outside bins. Trsah chutes than ever before. Thereafter I was more careful with my trash. I did not want to be cut off from my safe place. From the clean air. I feared benig lost in unknown dumps where I could never return.\n###\nI remember the night I made the five concentric circuits of the apartment, and stood in the innermost one clutching that monstrous receptacle the superintendent from the leasing office had provided. The walls of my domicile receded, and I was propelled by a foul draft through corridors of fathomless shadow with the needle-like spires of discarded furniture looming around me. After a while there was utter blackness, and then the pallid glow of myriad electric eyes forming strange, alien patterns upon the ceiling. Finally I saw a green-litten receptacle far before me, and discerned upon its yawning maw the twisted remnants of consumables packaged in no fashion I had ever known or purchased or conceived of. As I advanced closer to that vessel I saw a great square bin of polymer in an open vestibule, and felt a hideous revulsion clutching at me. I groaned and laboured, and after a blankness was again in my kitchen, sprawled flat over the five plastic sacks upon the linoleum. In that night\u2019s labour there was no more of tedium than in many a former night\u2019s labour; but there was more of dread because I knew I was closer to those outside bins and refuse-chutes than I had ever been before. Thereafter I was more cautious with my disposals, for I had no wish to be cut off from my sanctuary and from the clean air in unknown middens whence I could never return."}

Got to our kitchen, our fear had moved to the smaller. Still powerful device we needed to turn on again. From this counter, the black, grease-marked door rose sharply and terribly under the bright light. It reminded us again of those odd, one-eyed giatn stones from forgotten stories. When we thought of the hateful, stiff shapes inside it. Of the scary, formless things that might have pushed their foul-smelling, steamy way even to the highest, glass-covered turntable, we colud not face the idea of starting that meaningful, buzzing space again without disgust. The machine made noises like an evil, chanting spell over a wide range. To make things worse, we saw clear signs of local wetness around the inner window. Poor Wilkins must have seen this when he made that early mistake about reheating times. We thought with a shiver about that similar steam we had escaped from. We thought about that. About the disrespectful, nutrient-eating deep hole where all such smells came from.\n###\nYet long before we had passed the great, humming refrigerator and reached our kitchen our dread had become transferred to the lesser but formidable enough appliance whose re-engagement lay ahead of us. From this counter the black, grease-stained door reared up starkly and hideously against the fluorescent light, again reminding us of those strange, cyclopean monoliths of forgotten lore; and when we thought of the damnable, congealed geometries inside it, and of the frightful, amorphous entities that might have pushed their foetidly steaming way even to the topmost, glass-encrusted turntable, we could not face without loathing the prospect of again activating that suggestive, humming cavity where the machine made sounds like an evil, droning incantation over a wide range. To make matters worse, we saw distinct traces of local condensation around the inner window\u2014as poor Wilkins must have done when he made that early mistake about reheating times\u2014and thought shiveringly of that kindred vapour from which we had just escaped; of that, and of the blasphemous, nutrient-devouring abyss whence all such emanations came."}

Norrys took a lantern to the altar. He examined where Nigger - Man was pawing. He knelt and scraped away centuries of lichens. They joined the block to the floor. He found nothing and was to give up. I noticed a detail. It made me shudder, though it implied nothing beyond what I imagined. I told him about it. We both looked at its sign. We stared with the fixedness of discovery and acceptance. It was this: the flame set near the altar was. It was from a draft of air it had not received. This air came from the crack between floor and altar. Norrys was scraping lichens. We spent the rest of the night in the lit study. We discussed what to do. The discovery that some vault than the known stonework of the Romans lay under this placewould have excited us. But with the background, the fascination doubled. We hesitated. Should we abandon our search and leave the priory in caution? Should we satisfy our sense of adventure. Face whatever horrors awaited in the depths? By morning we had compromised. We decided to go to London to gather a group of archaeologists. Scientists fit to handle the mystery. It should be said that before leaving the we tried in to move the altar. We saw it as the gate to a pit of nameless fear. men than we would have to find what secret opened the gate.

He did not find anything, and was about to abandon his effort when I noticed a trivial circumstance which made me shudder, even though it implied nothing more than I had already imagined. I told him of it, and we both looked at its almost imperceptible manifestation with the fixedness of fascinated discovery and acknowledgment. It was only this\u2014that the flame of the lantern set down near the altar was slightly but certainly flickering from a draught of air which it had not before received, and which came indubitably from the crevice between floor and altar where Norrys was scraping away the lichens. We spent the rest of the night in the brilliantly lighted study, nervously discussing what we should do next. The discovery that some vault deeper than the deepest known masonry of the Romans underlay this accursed pile\u2014some vault unsuspected by the curious antiquarians of three centuries\u2014would have been sufficient to excite us without any background of the sinister. As it was, the fascination became twofold; and we paused in doubt whether to abandon our search and quit the priory forever in superstitious caution, or to gratify our sense of adventure and brave whatever horrors might await us in the unknown depths. By morning we had compromised, and decided to go to London to gather a group of archaeologists and scientific men fit to cope with the mystery. It should be mentioned that before leaving the sub-cellar we had vainly tried to move the central altar which we now recognised as the gate to a new pit of nameless fear. What secret would open the gate, wiser men than we would have to find. During many days in London Capt. Norrys and I presented our facts, conjectures, and legendary anecdotes to five eminent authorities, all men who could be trusted to respect any family disclosures which future explorations might develop. We found most of them little disposed to scoff, but instead intensely interested and sincerely sympathetic. It is hardly necessary to name them all, but I may say that they included Sir William Brinton, whose excavations in the Troad excited most of the world in their day. As we all took the train for Anchester I felt myself poised on the brink of frightful revelations, a sensation symbolised by the air of mourning among the many Americans at the unexpected death of the President on the other side of the world."}

The man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the hideous flame, and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semicircle he faced. At certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance, especially when he held above his head that abhorrent Necronomicon he had taken with him; and I shared all the obeisances because I had been summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers. Then the old man made a signal to the half-seen flute-player in the darkness, which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected. At this horror I sank nearly to the lichened earth, transfixed with a dread not of this nor any world, but only of the mad spaces between the stars. Out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold flame, out of the Tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled uncanny, unheard, and unsuspected, there flopped rhythmically a horde of tame, trained, hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly grasp, or sound brain ever wholly remember. They were not altogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human beings; but something I cannot and must not recall. They flopped limply along, half with their webbed feet and half with their membraneous wings; and as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them, and rode off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted river, into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataracts. The old spinning woman had gone with the throng, and the old man remained only because I had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like the rest. I saw when I staggered to my feet that the amorphous flute-player had rolled out of sight, but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by. As I hung back, the old man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded the Yule worship in this ancient place; that it had been decreed I should come back, and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed."}

In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs, and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world\u2019s attention to themselves. About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stovepipe. In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his window at night.

Center of some. to believe part of Earth 's history. The parts of this history are remembered in the. These parts had disappeared in the chaos of Earth 's changes. This happened before any race we know had walked out of being apes. lay an city. Compared to it, the Atlanits. Olatho\u00eb in the land of Lomar are things of today. They are not things of yesterday. This city belongs with things as Valusia, R\u2019lyeh, Ib in the land of Mnar. The Nameless City of Arabia Deserta. As we flew over that mess of towers, my imagination broke all limits. It wandered without purpose in areas of connections. It made links between this lost world. Some of my craziest dreams about the horror at the camp. The plane 's fuel tank, to be, had been filled. we had to be in our explorations., we covered a area of ground. Or, air. We swooped down to a level where the wind became nothing. There seemed to be no end to the mountain range. There seemed to be no end to the length of the stone city to its hills. Fifty miles of flight in each direction showed no change in the maze of rock. This maze reached up like a body through the - ending ice. There were,, some differences. For example, there were carvings on the canyon., that rivre had cut through the hills. Nearde its sinking place in the range. The land at the stream 's start had been carved into Cyclopean gateways. Something about the, barrel - shaped designs stirred,. - memories in both Danforth. We found star - shaped areas. These were squares. We noted rises and falls in the land. Where a hill rose, it was dug out into some kind of spreading stone building. But there were two exceptions. Of these two, one was damaged by weather to show what had been on the sticking - out point. The had a cone - shaped monument cavred from the rock. It looked like things as the - known Snake Tomb in the valley of Petra.\n###\nFor this place could be no ordinary city. It must have formed the primary nucleus and centre of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of earth\u2019s history whose outward ramifications, recalled only dimly in the most obscure and distorted myths, had vanished utterly amidst the chaos of terrene convulsions long before any human race we know had shambled out of apedom. Here sprawled a palaeogean megalopolis compared with which the fabled Atlantis and Lemuria, Commoriom and Uzuldaroum, and Olatho\u00eb in the land of Lomar are recent things of today\u2014not even of yesterday; a megalopolis ranking with such whispered pre-human blasphemies as Valusia, R\u2019lyeh, Ib in the land of Mnar, and the Nameless City of Arabia Deserta. As we flew above that tangle of stark titan towers my imagination sometimes escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic associations\u2014even weaving links betwixt this lost world and some of my own wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the camp. The plane\u2019s fuel-tank, in the interest of greater lightness, had been only partly filled; hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations. Even so, however, we covered an enormous extent of ground\u2014or rather, air\u2014after swooping down to a level where the wind became virtually negligible. There seemed to be no limit to the mountain-range, or to the length of the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills. Fifty miles of flight in each direction shewed no major change in the labyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpse-like through the eternal ice. There were, though, some highly absorbing diversifications; such as the carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the foothills and approached its sinking-place in the great range. The headlands at the stream\u2019s entrance had been boldly carved into Cyclopean pylons; and something about the ridgy, barrel-shaped designs stirred up oddly vague, hateful, and confusing semi-remembrances in both Danforth and me. We also came upon several star-shaped open spaces, evidently public squares; and noted various undulations in the terrain. Where a sharp hill rose, it was generally hollowed out into some sort of rambling stone edifice; but there were at least two exceptions. Of these latter, one was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting eminence, while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the well-known Snake Tomb in the ancient valley of Petra."}

I glanced sideways as I leaned into the room's shadows. No clear shape was visible, as I partly expected. Instead, the first thing I noticed was a buildup on the top edge with some web-like threads. Its particles, though seen unclearly, appeared very unpleasant. Several specks were still visible. On the far black area, I saw a faint, steady glow, not like the blinking before.

There was no distinct form visible, as I had half expected there would be. Instead, the first thing which caught my eye was a minute aggregation gathering upon the upper bezel and laden with some fibrous, web-like filaments. Its particles, though minutely and indistinctly seen, were of an especially repellent aspect. Several motes were still discernible; while on the far black expanse I could see a faint, steady sheen unlike the blinking indicator visible before, and of a curious hue which I could not precisely identify. Above the slanted panel ahead and to the left there loomed the tall silhouette of the desk lamp, but it was completely unlit. The musty odour, dispelled for a moment by some merciful draft, now closed in again with maddening intensity."}

The dream-filled sky lowered itself to the lonely watcher's window. It mixed with the thick air of his room. It made him part of its incredible marvel. Wild rivers of violet midnight came to that room. They sparkled with golden dust. Swirls of dsut and fire cmae from the farthest reaches of space. They were heavy with perfumes from beoynd known wordls. Opiate oceans flowed there. They were lit by suns no eye can ever see. Their whirlpools held strange dolphins and sea-nymphs from forgotten depths. Noiseless infinity swirled around the dreamer. It carried him away without even touching his body. His body stayed stiffly leaning from the lonely window. For days not counted on any human calendar, the tides of distant spheres gently carried him. They took him to join the dreams he desired. They were the dreams that men have lost. After many cycles, they softly left him sleeping. He slept on a green shore at sunrise. The grene shore smelled of lotus flowers. It was dotted with red water hyacinths. In my tormented ears, a nightmare sound never stops. It is a whirring and flapping sound. There is also a faint, far-off hwoling lkie some giant hound. This is not a dream. I fear it is not even madness. Too much has already happened to let me have those merciful doubts. St. John is a torn and mutilated body. I alone know why. My knowledge is such that I am about to shoot myself. I fear I will be torn apart in the same way. Down unlit and endless hallways of strange fantasy are swept by the black, formless Nemesis. This force drives me to destroy myself. May heaven forgive the foolishness. Sickness that led us both to such a monstrous faet! Wearied with the dullness of an ordinary world, where even the joys of romance. Adventure soon become boring, St. John and I eagerly followed every artistic and intellectual trend. We sought relief from our crushing boredom. The mysteries of the Symbolists. The intense joys of the pre-Raphaelites were all ours for a time. But each new interest lsot its novelty and appeal too quickly. Only the dark philosophy of the Decadents could keep our attention. We found it powerful only by slowly increasing the depth and evil of our explorations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon used up of their excitement. Finally, only the more direct stimulation of unnatural personal experiences and adventures remained for us.\n###\nAnd one night a mighty gulf was bridged, and the dream-haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher\u2019s window to merge with the close air of his room and make him a part of their fabulous wonder. There came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold; vortices of dust and fire, swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy with perfumes from beyond the worlds. Opiate oceans poured there, litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and sea-nymphs of unrememberable deeps. Noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without even touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window; and for days not counted in men\u2019s calendars the tides of far spheres bare him gently to join the dreams for which he longed; the dreams that men have lost. And in the course of many cycles they tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore; a green shore fragrant with lotus-blossoms and starred by red camalotes. In my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and flapping, and a faint, distant baying as of some gigantic hound. It is not dream\u2014it is not, I fear, even madness\u2014for too much has already happened to give me these merciful doubts. St. John is a mangled corpse; I alone know why, and such is my knowledge that I am about to blow out my brains for fear I shall be mangled in the same way. Down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldritch phantasy sweeps the black, shapeless Nemesis that drives me to self-annihilation. May heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so monstrous a fate! Wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world, where even the joys of romance and adventure soon grow stale, St. John and I had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui. The enigmas of the Symbolists and the ecstasies of the pre-Raphaelites all were ours in their time, but each new mood was drained too soon of its diverting novelty and appeal. Only the sombre philosophy of the Decadents could hold us, and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diabolism of our penetrations. Baudelaire and Huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills, till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures."}

Of course the town\u2019s real business was the refinery, whose commercial office was on the square only a few doors east of where we stood. Old Man Marsh was never seen, but sometimes went to the works in a closed, curtained car. There were all sorts of rumours about how Marsh had come to look. He had once been a great dandy, and people said he still wore the frock-coated finery of the Edwardian age, curiously adapted to certain deformities. His sons had formerly conducted the office in the square, but latterly they had been keeping out of sight a good deal and leaving the brunt of affairs to the younger generation. The sons and their sisters had come to look very queer, especially the elder ones; and it was said that their health was failing. One of the Marsh daughters was a repellent, reptilian-looking woman who wore an excess of weird jewellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to which the strange tiara belonged. My informant had noticed it many times, and had heard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard, either of pirates or of daemons.
